abstract = {Advances in the availability and sophistication of software to facilitate the analysis of secondary data have contributed toward the growth of textual analysis. 10-K reports are a particularly salient source of insight into an array of issues in accounting and finance research yet remain underutilized in marketing. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to offer a rationale for such analysis and a method that can be applied in B2B marketing. We draw on a strong tradition of textual analysis in finance to outline a method of text mining 10-K reports. We then discuss the downloading of raw texts, parsing raw text files and linking 10-Ks to various dependent measures. We provide links for downloading parsed 10-K files and suggest software for textual analysis. The framework offers B2B marketers a rich alternative to primary data and proprietary datasets. Ongoing advances in AI-enabled NLP text analysis further increase the future value of the approach for B2B marketers.}

Its three objectives are: (i) to explore the effects of technology distraction on three types of consumer responses, i.e. cognitive, affective, and behavioural responses; (ii) to explore the effects of technology distraction on sensory overload; and (iii) to explore the effects of technology distraction on discomfort. To achieve these objectives, two qualitative studies were carried out. In Study 1, 25 semi-structured interviews were conducted with members of Generation Z in London, UK. Its purpose was to devise a model based on the objectives. In Study 2, 12 practitioners and academics specialising in technology-related disciplines were consulted to explore the practical utility of the model. Thematic analysis by means of NVivo 12 was carried out. The findings confirm all the objectives were achieved based on social cognitive theory, with a few additional suggestions collected from Study 2. The main implications for researchers and technology firms are provided, along with the study’s limitations and possibilities for future research.}

Central to the SDG agenda is the vital role of business innovation in fostering positive change and promoting the triple bottom line of sustainability: people, planet, and prosperity. Many years have passed following the SDGs’ inception, yet the engagement of business innovation scholarship with the SDGs remains sparse. Moreover, a comprehensive review examining the convergence of business, innovation, and sustainability through the lens of the SDGs is notably absent, constraining insights into present advancements and prospective trajectories. In this regard, this study adopts the SDGs as a lens to investigate the contribution of business innovation to sustainable development challenges and its impact on the SDG agenda. To do so, this study conducts a systematic literature review, incorporating a bibliometric analysis of articles published in top-tier business journals, to offer an integrated overview of current trends in business, innovation, and sustainability research through the lens of the SDGs. In addition, this study performs a content analysis to consolidate and synthesize relevant research in this space, resulting in a multi-dimensional framework that illustrates the intricate, dynamic interplay between the drivers, dimensions, and impacts of business innovation on sustainability and their relationship with the SDGs. In doing so, this study accentuates extant gaps, delineates profound implications, and proposes meaningful directions to advance the understanding of the intersection between business, innovation, and sustainability in the context of the SDGs.}

Admittedly, scholars have given it noteworthy attention in the recent past, yet gaps persist related to the products and services, antecedents, and consequents examined. Our study augments the understanding of the negative aspects of the customer-brand relationship by examining brand hate and betrayal as its two manifestations. Using online food delivery (OFD) platforms as the product/service under focus, we employ a mixed-method approach to identify the negative experiences (i.e., safety and hygiene grievances, dissatisfaction, negative word of mouth, and advertisement overload) that could stimulate the negative emotions of betrayal and hate in customers. Thereafter, we examine the desire for avoidance and retaliation as a response to these negative feelings. Our model is grounded in the Stimulus-Organism-Response framework and tested through analysis of data collected from 342 OFD users in the United States. The structural equation modelling results confirm a positive association of customer dissatisfaction, negative word of mouth, and advertisement overload with brand betrayal and hate. Betrayal and hate, in turn, associate positively with avoidance and retaliation. Brand love positively moderates the association of advertisement overload with betrayal and hate and safety and hygiene grievances with betrayal.}

Failures in implementing e-government interventions suggest the lack of an integrated approach in understanding e-government as a discipline. In this study, we present an overarching and integrated conceptual framework of e-government grounded in robust qualitative research to describe the factors that must be integrated to implement e-government successfully. Drawing insights from 168 in-depth interviews conducted with multiple stakeholders in India, this study defines e-government as a multidimensional construct with customer orientation, channel orientation and technology orientation as its antecedents. Building on customer orientation and relationship marketing theories, this study proposes that the most significant factor impacting success in implementing e-government projects is citizen orientation, followed by channel orientation and technology orientation. The study also identifies the digital divide, economic growth and political stability as moderators of e-government. Furthermore, the study proposes the tangible and intangible outcomes of e-government with perceived privacy and shared understanding as moderating conditions. Finally, the study presents relevant theoretical and practical implications with future research directions.}

Two experiments demonstrate that threats to time autonomy mediate the impact of perceived busyness on variety seeking (study 3 and study 4). Additionally, this research verifies the boundary of busyness type (proactive busyness vs. forced busyness) (study 5). This study offers important theoretical and managerial insights by revealing the psychological mechanisms and boundary conditions and enhances our understanding of the busyness, threats to time autonomy, and variety seeking, offering valuable insights for strategic marketing and targeted advertising.}

Based on the organizational learning and sales literature, this study explores the relationship among salesforce steering, salesperson learning and innovative sales performance in service enterprises. It develops and tests a conceptual framework based on a survey of 476 strategic front-line employees (SFLEs) in China's tourism industry. The findings indicate that salesforce steering instruments have no direct effect on innovative sales performance, while exploratory learning and exploitative learning play mediating roles in the relationship between salesforce steering and innovative sales performance. These findings integrate different streams of literature and improve the understanding of the management and learning behaviour of SFLEs in the context of process innovation.}

This study looks at how customers feel and act when they get special treatment compared to others (preferential treatment), using the idea of how emotions are stirred by certain events to understand its effect on what customers do (affective events theory). Using a time-lagged survey of 318 customers in the retail sector, we explored how preferential treatment influences three kinds of customer behavior: feeling extremely happy (customer delight), speaking favorably about a product or service (customer advocacy), and making unplanned purchases (impulse buying). We discovered that preferential treatment makes customers much happier, which then encourages them to both advocate for and buy products on a whim. Unexpectedly, our findings indicate that preferential treatment's ability to elevate customer happiness is somewhat diminished in those with a higher inclination toward seeking attention (attention-seeking motives), due to a perceived lack of genuineness or merit in the treatment received. Consequently, this study illustrates the complex dynamics of preferential treatment in enhancing customer delight, advocacy, and impulse purchasing, while also uncovering the noteworthy role of individual differences in these processes.}

Success in today’s retail environment means being able to create and maintain brand communities, to generate instant and measurable hype, and to deliver personalized consumer experiences—all of which can be readily achieved through a strategically placed physical business presence. In this study, a survey of retailing organizations worldwide reveals that among those that had implemented at least one pop-up shop, more than 80% considered it a success. The results also show that the primary reasons for activating pop-up shops were to create connections with current and potential customers, to increase brand awareness, to introduce a new product or brand to the marketplace, and to stage a new product or brand. While the respondents deemed revenue generated at pop-up shops important, they considered improving market visibility (e.g., through social media, website traffic, or media coverage) a more significant objective. Given the economic potential of pop-up shops, this research provides retailing organizations with guiding principles for developing and operating successful pop-up shops in the current marketplace.}

Human brands, especially athlete brands, are about to outperform traditional brands on digital platforms. Drawing on literature from human branding, integrative branding, and performativity theory, this study identifies actors and analyzes their performances based on a case study of a professional athlete brand. We apply a multi-method approach using netnography and interviews to gain a deeper understanding of brand meaning co-creation. We contribute to existing literature by introducing the concept of integrative branding to the management of human brands. Additionally, we reveal three novel performance categories for the co-creation of human brands on digital engagement platforms. Our findings extend the literature by delivering in-depth insights into the brand meaning co-creation of athlete brands as a specific type of human brands. This study marks a starting point for further research on human brands.}

Participants with high levels of value-expressive attitudes reported more positive brand evaluation whentheadvertisement featured an artwork (vs. no artwork).Furthermore, art infusion reduced the feelings of self-inauthenticity, thereby enhancing brand attitudes.The findings highlight the importance of art infusion pertinent to improving brand evaluation and mitigating potential negative psychological consequences of luxury consumption, a relatively unexplored research area.}

We, therefore, build on an ADO framework-based, illustrative case study of three UK retailers wherein we derive and exemplify how mental burnout in a volatile environment becomes a very important care management necessity which has been neglected thus far. Further, we detail how to contend with this need and how there is a demand for customisation, comprehensiveness, and consistency. In this respect, we conceptualise a technology-people-integrated toolkit that can be implemented with immediate effect for retail care management. We detail the practicalities work in two scenarios. To conclude, managerial and theoretical implications of this toolkit and study have been detailed along with the paper's limitations and suggestions for future research.}

In the evolving digital data rich market environment, customer-based resources, a subset of a firm's market-based resources, are becoming increasingly important as potential sources of competitive advantage. Customer information assets refer to information of economic value about customers owned by a firm. Information analysis capabilities are complex bundles of skills and knowledge embedded in a firm's organizational processes employed to generate customer knowledge from customer information assets. Customer insights or knowledge is a firm's extent of understanding of customers that informs its business decisions. Building on the resource-based, capabilities-based and knowledge-based views of the firm, resource advantage theory of competition, and the outside-in and inside-out approaches to strategy, this article presents a market resources-based view of strategy, competitive advantage and performance.

This study addresses a critical gap by investigating the mediation of negative electronic word-of-mouth (NeWOM) intensity between brand hate and the two different forms of consumers’ coping behaviors: boycott (instrumental aggression) and brand sabotage (hostile aggression). It also demonstrates the moderating role of the Big Five personality traits in these pathways. An empirical survey with 391 participants recruited through Prolific reveals that brand hate directly affects NeWOM intensity, consumer boycott, and brand sabotage. These effects are more substantial for those who score high in neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness. On the other hand, the effects of brand hate on NeWOM intensity and boycott are more profound when agreeableness is low. In contrast, only brand hate-to-boycott relationship strengthens when openness is low. Interestingly, NeWOM intensity mediates the relationships between brand hate and the two consumer behaviors, i.e., consumer boycott and brand sabotage. These findings enrich the literature on negative consumer-brand relationships and provide managers assistance in developing effective strategies for de-escalating consumers’ use of aggressive behaviors in response to brand hate.}

With many organisations overwhelmed by how to manage and use big data, the paper identifies the dynamic capabilities required to exploit big data for strategic marketing and to improve market responsiveness. Data gathered from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with senior managers from four case study organisations, reveals the five interconnected dynamic capabilities required to leverage value from big data. These capabilities are shown to be part of a sequential ‘sensing-reconfiguring-seizing’ process, in which the reconfiguring capabilities play a vital role. The findings contribute to dynamic capabilities theory by identifying and mapping the configuration of big data capabilities required to support strategic marketing initiatives. A new Big Data Capabilities Model is developed, which can be used by organisations to guide how they can leverage value from big data.}

To address this gap, this study examines the drivers and outcomes of purchase engagement in B2B professional services. Using the structural equation modelling approach, the results from a survey of CEOs and/or owner-managers of small and medium-sized enterprises in Australia found that customization and loyalty to the account manager are two salient drivers of purchase engagement. Purchase engagement is also found to yield three important outcomes, namely consideration set size (CSZ), dependence, and willingness to pay a premium price (WTP). In the study, customers' dependence on the suppliers was found to act as a mechanism through which engagement can influence CSZ and WTP.}

With unethical marketing being widely reported in the media, this study commenced with the assumption that awareness of consequences (AC) has little impact on ethical decision-making (EDM). This assumption, however, was empirically refuted based on a survey where marketing professionals with high levels of AC engage more in EDM. Noteworthily, this study found that the relationship between AC and EDM is mediated by self-identity (SI), which highlighted the importance for marketing professionals to recognize their own moral identity in ensuring the translation of their AC into EDM. The study also revealed that gender plays a moderating role in the aforementioned relationship, with the effect being stronger for men as opposed to women, a noteworthy deviation from past findings. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to theory and practice, wherein a foundational theory of ethical decision-making is established.}

Two company surveys result in differing preference structures for online shops and traditional companies. Online shops show high preference for integrating review results in online ads, while traditional companies prefer integration into search engine results.

Of particular interest in this study is fine dining, a luxury service that consumers pursue and enjoy in the hospitality industry. Though many studies on luxury goods avail, few studies have investigated luxury services such as fine dining, with little insights on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on its consumption. We argue that research in this direction is important given the unprecedented impact that the pandemic has had on humanity and the need to respond to potential changes in customer expectations for luxury services such as fine dining in a post-pandemic era. Hence, in this study, we investigate the antecedents and consequences of customer satisfaction with fine dining using a Delphi study to acquire and examine field data from customers who continue to dine in fine-dining restaurants during the pandemic. Our findings suggest that fine diners place an emphasis on food quality (sensory experience, satiety value, menu selection), hygiene, and price when evaluating their satisfaction of the fine-dining experience during the pandemic, which significantly influences their future recommendation of the fine-dining restaurant to others. No significant differences in customer behavior based on income were observed, thereby lending credence and support to the idea of masstige marketing.}

Extant brand transparency literature has fragmented approaches to conceptualizing transparency, some equating it to the quantity of information available, while others propose various characteristics that inform consumers' subjective perceptions, indicating the need for a multi-dimensional construct. Informed by signaling theory, this present research refines the conceptual structure in the extant literature and aims to specify the critical dimensions of consumer perceived brand transparency (perceived proactivity, clarity, and objectivity). We establish perceived information availability as a necessary but insufficient antecedent of brand transparency to facilitate brand ethicality. Finally, we identify the mediating and moderating mechanisms that facilitate transparency’s positive effects on perceptions of brand ethicality.

Our primary data source consists of in-depth interviews conducted with managers and practitioners who possess extensive experience in innovation management and growth hacking. Through a systematic inductive concept development approach and a multilevel analysis, we develop a novel conceptualization that illustrates how growth hacking strategies can be effectively implemented across four levels of analysis: market, organization, project, and product. Our findings highlight the importance of adopting growth hacking practices to minimize the likelihood of innovation failure in each of these domains. From a practical perspective, we offer recommendations on the strategies that companies should employ to effectively learn from the challenges associated with innovation.

We show how outside-in and inside-out clash culturally, and trade off strategically, especially in service. Technological advances in communications and information technology have enabled closer relationships with customers, and “big data” for managing those relationships. The marketing function is important for managing outside-in, because market orientation alone is insufficient. Outside-in management is most effective for focusing on customer satisfaction and revenue, since insights about customer needs and wants tend to move bottom-up through the organization. Taken to its logical conclusion, outside-in implies replacing inside-out, product-focused management (e.g., brand managers) with outside-in, customer-focused management (e.g., customer managers). Customer-focused, future-oriented metrics (e.g., customer satisfaction, customer lifetime value, customer equity) increasingly grab attention away from aggregate, short-term metrics (e.g., product sales). Long-term impact from customer-relevant issues such as discrimination plays out over time, and must be researched using longitudinal methods.

This phenomenon has intensified globally along with smartphone penetration. SNGs, though sharing characteristics with traditional video games, have distinct functionalities and affect players’ socio-psychological behavior. Despite their growing and multidimensional significance – consequent to their novelty and incessant development and penetration – the personal and wider social effects of SNGs have been visibly inadequately researched. Aiming to fill this knowledge gap, the present study investigates the psychological and social impacts of SNGs on users, as well as the moderating role of age and gender therein. Methodologically, hypotheses and a conceptual model are first developed based on extant contextual, behavioral, and addiction-specific theories. They are subsequently validated through a survey-based PLS-SEM technique. The study ultimately identifies and elucidates the role of explicit dimensions leading to SNG addiction and highlights its impact at the micro (personal) and macro (society) levels.}

While the initial catalyst for transformative marketing was the desire of customers for more meaningful engagement, the global impact of great crises (or mega disruptions) has accelerated the evolution of transformative marketing. With a focus on business-to-business (B2B) marketing, this article aims to offer transformative marketing insights to support B2B marketers in preparing for, navigating in, and recovering from great crises using the great lockdown that transpired during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as a case. To do so, this article employs the marketing mix as an organizing framework and performs an integrative review of practice and scholarly articles relating to B2B marketing and COVID-19. In doing so, this article delivers a seminal integrative review that is informed by both practice and scholarly sources in B2B marketing, thereby establishing its methodological novelty and value. More importantly, this article highlights “what” is necessary and “how” B2B marketers can (re)configure the product, price, place, promotion, people, process, and physical evidence elements of their marketing activities to steer their B2B marketing operations toward success in a world where global crises are a commonplace. Therefore, this article contributes in two major ways: the first from a theoretical perspective, by extending the theoretical generalizability of transformative marketing, and the second from a managerial standpoint, by shedding light on practitioner issues and offering practical suggestions for B2B marketers to prepare for, navigate in, and recover from great crises in the new normal.}

Developing a content aesthetic quality scale with a sample of 1166 buyers of luxury fashion brands, we identify two routes for how social media content can augment brand loyalty and foster brand love for luxury fashion brands. We reveal that the effectiveness of social media content in generating customer brand engagement depends on its ability to be entertaining. Specifically, our findings demonstrate that entertainment affects customer engagement and mediates the relationship between content marketing (specifically, content aesthetic quality and celebrity endorsement) and customer engagement with luxury fashion brands. Customer engagement fosters brand loyalty and brand love. Managerial implications for luxury brand managers and social media marketers are discussed.}

In the present study, we examined, over two and a half years, the application of service design for advanced services value proposition design in a multicase study of 10 manufacturers engaged in digital servitization. By applying a research through design method, we studied the impact of service design on the digital servitization process and identified the types of events that shape the advanced services value proposition design. As a result, this research provides further insights into the impact of service design on digital servitization in the manufacturing context and offers new avenues for further research in the field.}

To address this gap, this review conducted a combination of bibliometric and thematic analyses on 861 CE articles published in 377 Scopus-indexed journals between 2006 and 2020. As a result, this review reveals the major trends in article, author, country, and journal performance, as well as the past, present, and future thematic trends of CE research, and thus, provides a one stop, state-of-the-art overview of CE that marketing scholars can rely on to position and design future CE research.}

The results underscore the significant impact of experienced hospitableness on non-visitors to the extent that a low level of trust would no longer make a difference in their visit intentions. Furthermore, non-visitors who have a low perception of a destination still have a higher tendency to be willing to travel to there if they have experienced a high level of hospitableness in their relationships with natives from the destination.}

The model, tested on multilevel data, shows that SMA and its interaction with industry munificence and dynamism are significant determinants of the relative compensation of the sales function (RCSF). Results show that innovativeness and marketing resource endowment (two dimensions of SMA) have opposite effects on RCSF. Additionally, different industry contingencies—industry munificence, dynamism, and competitiveness—interact differently with SMA when explaining RCSF. This study highlights the relevance of the sales function in firms’ pay practices and advances the understanding of variations in RCSF.}

Using a dataset of US public firms spanning from 1994 to 2019, we first examine the relationship between CEO overconfidence and customer satisfaction, focusing on the mediating role of R&D and advertising expenditures, and the moderating role of CEO equity-based compensation. We find that CEO overconfidence positively influences customer satisfaction, and this positive impact is partially mediated by R&D and advertising. In addition, moderated path analysis indicates that CEO equity-based compensation increases the indirect effect of CEO overconfidence on customer satisfaction. We next examine and document that CEO overconfidence moderates the positive impact of customer satisfaction on firm value. Our results contribute to the extant literature by highlighting that CEO overconfidence not only positively affects shareholder value, but also links to the consequences of strategic marketing decisions, such as customer satisfaction. Our study provides implications for boards of directors, who may need to align CEO and firm marketing spending decisions. It also raises shareholders’ awareness of the presence and impact of CEO overconfidence.}

Drawing on qualitative data, the empirical investigation suggests a change agency model and uncovers the different roles performed by marketing managers. These roles materialize through four different postures in strategic change programs (i.e., pilot, advisor, expert, and synergist) with the respective dynamic managerial capabilities that marketing managers rely on in each configuration.}

This study establishes that the value associated with AI tools leads to relationship (parasocial) formation with them and itincreases the possibility of AI technologies use. Study showed that the users who have different liking towards AI tools usage (AI fans, detractors and indifferent) influence the relationship between AI tools’ value and intentions to use AI differently. The study further offers valuable theoretical and practical implications.}

This is true in particular of marketing, where its possible use extends beyond mere segmentation, personalization, and decision-making. We explore the drivers of and barriers to AI and ML in marketing by adopting a dual strategic and behavioral focus, which provides both an inward (AI and ML for marketers) and an outward (AI and ML for customers) perspective. From our mixed-method approach (a Delphi study, a survey, and two focus groups), we derive several research propositions that address the challenges facing marketing managers and organizations in three distinct domains: (1) Culture, Strategy, and Implementation; (2) Decision-Making and Ethics; (3) Customer Management. Our findings contribute to better understanding the human factor behind AI and ML, and aim to stimulate interdisciplinary inquiry across marketing, organizational behavior, psychology, and ethics.}

The authors also empirically derive propositions about the key contingencies of DCM performance. This conceptualization and the related contingencies provide an actionable roadmap for effective implementation of DCM for managers in business markets.}

However, social media research in B2B lacks a comprehensive overview from a strategic perspective, with most research to date having been focused on the tactical use of social media platforms, that is to say, in describing specific tools to implement a strategy. In the present systematic literature review we address this deficiency. Our findings reveal that prior B2B research predominately investigated social media as short-term tactics with context-specific limitations. Our thematic analysis extends beyond these boundaries and extracts from the literature three relationship-orientated themes in social media, namely their use as a tool for: 1) sales-facilitation, 2) integrated communication, and 3) employee engagement. These three themes are distinct yet interdependent and are each necessary if organizations are to develop a competitive advantage within the social media environment. The descriptive statistics and thematic analysis in the study present a set of five key findings that reflect the research gaps presently in the literature and thus highlight significant future research directions. The study also highlights the utility for organizations to employ social media in a strategic manner rather than simply as a tactical tool.}

Data on a sample of 210 Indian firms from 2009 to 2016 suggest that CEO narcissism positively influences the firm's myopic management. Furthermore, market orientation partially mediates the influence of CEO narcissism on myopic management, such that CEO narcissism lowers market orientation. The lesser the market orientation more is myopic management. However, as the output orientation of the board of directors increases, the indirect positive effect of narcissism on myopic management is decreased. Our study shines a light on the antecedents of myopic management and its role as a mediator under the contingency effect of demographics of the board of directors, i.e., the marketing board of directors.}

We assess the latter with respect to its effect on customer satisfaction. While a form of intimate attachment can occur between customers and small businesses, affective commitment is prevalent in customers’ attitudes and could be conflicting with the distant and impersonal nature of chatbot services. Therefore, we also test the moderating role of customers’ affective commitment in the relationship between customer experience and customer satisfaction. Data come from 408 respondents, and the results offer an explicit course of action for family businesses to effectively embed chatbot services in their customer communication.

The manipulation examined their ethical attitudes and credibility perceptions toward the NA articles before and after the persuasion knowledge. Findings strengthen research assumptions that most adolescents have encountered NA without recognizing it as persuasive communication. Adolescents find NA articles less credible and less ethical when they are informed about it. Moreover, results show that adolescents in general have a tendency to accept NA as a moral practice, while findings point to significant differences in responses moderated by country of origin.}

A total of 250,979 tweets and 44,560 replies by 113 DMOs before and during the pandemic were carefully examined using descriptive and time series analyses, topic modelling, sentiment analysis, and principal component analysis. The findings revealed four change patterns in Twitter usage: degrade, disseminate, engage, and elevate. Topic modelling identified 19 content topics and their five trends during the pandemic: falling, rebounding, maintaining, relapsing, and rising. Additionally, the four general content strategies — emotional, functional, informational, and experiential — provided a guideline and competitive landscape for DMOs to use in planning and devising their marketing communication strategies to handle such a shock. This study effectively addresses several research gaps, including the dearth of longitudinal, cross-country, and supply-side studies on crisis communications in tourism. As such, it enriches the existing body of knowledge by taking a comprehensive look at the diverse communication executions and strategies during both regular periods and crises. In doing so, it bridges the gap between theories of crisis communications and general social media communication strategies employed by DMOs.}

The analysis of consumer buying behavior and the analysis of market demand dynamics prevail in the new markets strategy. Although product differentiation to achieve positioning is an important driver for companies that use growth market strategies, it is concluded that the consumer buying behavior hypothesis is valid because the analysis allows implementing differentiation actions that are included in strategic control, which is a complex thought process developed by top management.}

However, such inclusivity initiatives can lead to consumer backlash when luxury brands rely on perfectionism and self-esteem to elicit admiration and desirability. We ask whether weaving models with disabilities into brand narratives contributes to positive consumer responses. Using signaling theory, our study employs a structural equation modeling approach to show that, despite the negative effect of perceived brand inclusivity on consumers’ willingness to buy, the serial mediation by transportation into brand stories and advertising credibility flips the effect to positive. By doing so, this study also extends extant literature on inclusive advertising in luxury fashion by going beyond dominant manifestations of inclusivity tackling feminism and LGBTQAI + rights.}

In turn, these three streams have implications for the controversies over whether strategy's focus should be “outside-in or inside-out” and whether strategy should be static or dynamic. This article addresses the three streams of strategic thought and the two controversies by (1) explicating their nature, (2) showing how strategies related to them have evolved through time, and (3) pointing toward the controversies' resolution. The article argues that all theories of strategy assume a theory of how competition works. In turn, theories of competition are housed within disciplinary research traditions. Therefore, understanding the controversies in contemporary strategy is furthered by understanding both the theories of competition that underlie each strategic approach and their respective research traditions.}

abstract = {Smart home technologies (SHTs) encompass a wide range of products and services that fulfill users' needs and wants regarding the enhancement of the quality and comfort of their daily lives. Despite the pervasive impact of these technologies, SHT penetration is still growing at a relatively slow pace. A prominent reason of this might be inadequate understanding of the factors that motivate consumers to embrace SHTs. However, it is difficult to explain the adoption of SHTs with a replication of traditional adoption models due to differences in contextual factors. In addition, existing models solely use conventional adoption variables from the consumer perspective and exclude the business viewpoint. Hence, to fill this gap, initially, in-depth interviews with industry experts have been conducted and some predictive variables that were not mentioned in the literature have been identified. Consequently, these variables were used to enrich the existing diffusion of innovation (DOI) model and offer an extended SHT adoption framework. Based on this framework, value superiority, consumer protection, design & reputation, enjoyment, complexity, and compatibility have been extracted through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) as the dimensions of SHT adoption. However, the relative impact of these dimensions may be different for distinct consumer segments. To identify these differences and better design marketing and communication efforts, it is crucial to consider different characteristics of user segments and cohorts. For this purpose, users were classified into meaningful segments based on Technology Readiness Index (TRI) 2.0. Therefore, first, the TRI 2.0 variables were grouped into two categories as technology motivators and technology inhibitors after running another EFA. Based on these two dimensions, users were grouped under three segments after cluster analysis as Tech Savvies, Tech Yin-Yangers, and Tech Mediocres. Ultimately, the final objective of this research is to discover the differences among these segments in terms of their attitude toward and intention to adopt SHTs. Subsequently, independent regression analyses have been run to figure out the relative impact of the six dimensions of SHT adoption on attitude toward and intention to adopt SHTs for three different clusters. It is observed that there are significant differences among these segments that signal the vital importance of treating these consumer groups in distinct ways.}

This study identifies product attributes which impact consumer purchase intention of ‘masstige’ products, and further analyzes the moderator effects of consumer emotion, status, and pride on purchase intention.

This research develops a model of how consumers decide their next electrified vehicle. Based on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and Risk-Benefit Models, the electric vehicle (EV) purchase decision is modeled as primarily based on beliefs of the perceived benefits and the perceived risks of technology adoption and social influences. Further, beliefs of a manufacturer's expertise and trustworthiness were found to reduce consumer risk concerns and strengthen consumer conviction that the benefits of technology were attainable. Structural equation modeling of survey data confirm the proposed consumer decision model, and our contention that technology adoption can be better understood by specifically exploring discordant consumer beliefs of the post-purchase consequences. The results of our research provide a new understanding of salient consumer risk and benefit beliefs when consumers face new technologies that represent a paradigm shift. Results also provide insight for technology firms that need to constantly develop new strategic marketing actions designed to increase demand for their complex technological products.}

To effectively respond to and manage the opportunities and challenges that arise from this, organizations are developing competencies and processes that evolve their agility, fine-tuning them to the artificial intelligence customer service system (AICS) and wider digitalization setting. In this context, this study identifies the factors impacting the adoption of an AI-integrated CRM system (AICS) in agile organizations as a part of their digitalization strategy. Methodologically, the research builds its theoretical foundation on extant works to develop hypotheses and a corresponding conceptual model. The model is quantitatively validated through a survey across the spectrum of Indian companies, following expert-based pretesting and pilot testing, and subsequently it is statistically tested using the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. The results, contextualized against the backdrop of organizational agility, identify and elucidate the relationship between stakeholders and perceived value and easiness of AICS, between employee trust and attitude, and the influence of attitude and behavioral intention as key mediators towards AICS adoption. The findings are conclusively transcribed into tangible implications for practice and explicit avenues for future research.}

Using a sample of 1726 participants from four countries (United States, United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa), a structural equation model was conducted. Results indicate that online content engagement and effective communication influence consumers’ online experience and positively affects their behavioural intentions towards the event. Online consumer-to-consumer interaction also showed a positive effect on consumers’ future behavioural intentions.

Despite the widespread adoption of VAs in recent times, consumers continue to avoid using VAs for transactional purposes. Currently, we have a limited understanding of the various antecedents and consequences of consumer decision avoidance in the context of VAs. This study aims to bridge this gap by adopting the decision avoidance theory as a theoretical lens and a convergent mixed-methods approach to identify the antecedents (i.e. cognitive biases and nudging) and consequences (i.e. rejection of VAs for transactional purposes and intention to adopt VAs for transactional purposes) of consumer decision avoidance (i.e. consumer inertia and procrastination). The study findings suggest a positive association of cognitive biases with consumer inertia, procrastination and rejection. While nudging is positively associated with procrastination and intentions, it shares a negative association with rejection. Consumer inertia is positively associated with rejection and negatively associated with intentions. Meanwhile, procrastination shares a positive association with intention and a negative association with rejection. Technology comfort has a significant moderating (negative) influence on the association between cognitive biases and intentions.}

Building on the market-driven view and the dynamic capabilities view of competitive strategy, we examine SM use in a framework of market-sensing and customer-linking capabilities that influence firm performance. Our research model posits that market orientation stimulates SM use to enhance market-sensing capability thereby facilitating two customer-linking capabilities, namely customer relationship management and brand management, which collectively contribute to greater marketing performance and financial performance. Our research model is empirically tested using a survey of 143 UK B2B SMEs. The findings broadly support our theorization in which the strategic use of SM, an essential part of market-sensing capability, enhances customer-linking capabilities. Interestingly, although SM use influences brand management capability, its suggested influences on both customer relationship management capability and marketing performance occur only through the mediation of brand management capability. Both customer-linking capabilities positively influence marketing performance and in turn financial performance. Our findings provide novel conceptual and empirical advancement of how market-centric B2B SMEs strategically use SM to enhance their market-sensing and in turn customer-linking capabilities, and hence firm performance.}

Economic theory suggests that common ownership could affect firm performance, but little empirical research has examined the nature of this effect or how a firm’s extant marketing potentially relates to this effect. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a relationship between common ownership and firm performance that is moderated by the firm’s extant marketing capabilities and its relative marketing strategic emphasis. Our empirical approach employs data from over 43 million institutional holdings to develop a measure of common ownership and accounts for empirical issues like endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity. The results document a positive relationship between common ownership and firm performance and provide some evidence that this effect is stronger for firms with lower marketing capabilities and a relative strategic emphasis towards R&D spending. These results suggest that public policymakers should consider the firms’ extant strategic marketing when assessing regulations on common ownership.}

Using data partitioning on a random sample of 323 consumers to generate usable cases for three interrelated studies, the paper reports that the effects of possession- and social inclusion-defined materialism are consistently accentuated in the purchase of luxury goods rather than economical goods, whereby consumers with high levels of possession- and social inclusion-defined materialism are more likely to purchase luxury goods than consumers with low levels of possession- and social inclusion-defined materialism. However, the paper finds that possession- and social inclusion-defined materialism have no significant effects on the individual and group patronage of economical and luxury services.

We investigate the impact of two types of servitization – product-oriented vs. customer-oriented services – on organizational resilience. Using secondary data collected from 1,914 manufacturing firms listed in the US stock markets, we find that servitization is inversely related to organizational resilience during the COVID-19 disruption; that is, manufacturing firms with more revenue from service businesses endure more significant stock price loss and take longer to bounce back from the loss caused by the COVID-19 disruption. The impact is more pronounced for manufacturing firms providing product-oriented services (than those providing customer-oriented services). This study extends the understanding of the dark side of servitization relating to organizational resilience during a major disruption.}

Yet, recognizing mounting evidence that family firms demonstrate superior environmental proactivity, it is likely that other drivers also inspire their environmentalism. To assess this possibility, an integrated stakeholder, institutional and resource-based perspective is espoused. Thus, this inquiry assesses how environmental pressure from customers stimulates environmental initiatives and the extent to which this constitution would boost export intensity. Based on 620 observations of Turkish family firms, a robust path analysis procedure revealed that customer pressure positively increases the adoption of environmental planning and energy management. In turn, these instruments work in concert to reduce environmental regulatory obstacles and enhance export intensity, with environmental planning playing a key role. Theoretically, customer pressure is introduced as a fresh antecedent. Practically, family firms in Turkey can grasp the virtuous knock-on effect of acceding to the environmental pressure exerted by customers.}

Using a novel construct, strategic international alliance emphasis, that captures the tradeoff between value creation and appropriation via international alliances, the authors find that an external focus on value creation increases sales growth. This effect can be further enhanced when firms focus simultaneously on value appropriation internally. In addition, the ratio of international alliances and percentage of joint ventures in firms' alliance portfolios impacts the effect of external value creation on sales growth. These results highlight the importance of coordinating strategic emphases internally and externally.}

Specifically, we hypothesize that customer equity drivers influence trust in social robots and trust in service providers.

The study used a two-stage hybrid partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM)-artificial neural network (ANN) analysis to examine the proposed relationships. Findings show that while all the customer equity drivers influence trust in service providers, only brand and relationship equity influence trust in social robots. Results also suggest that trust in service providers mediates the relationship between customer equity drivers and customer experience quality. In addition, we find that consumers' trust in service providers helps generate trust in social robots. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.}

Also, while previous research has focused on betrayals made by the brand itself, it has paid less attention to betrayals by the brand’s personnel. This paper focuses on one potentially important positive consequence of brand personnel betrayal experiences (a consumer’s feeling of being betrayed by the brand staff members): the increased willingness of consumers to share personal insights and information with the brand after experiencing a brand personnel betrayal. A field data set and two online experiments show that consumers are more prepared to share personal information with the brand when experiencing brand personnel betrayals than when experiencing other types of service or brand failures. The effect is mediated by consumers’ social affirmation mindset and moderated by privacy concerns.}

It is inseparable from the readiness of SMEs to adopt the digital sharing economy business model. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the readiness for change in SMEs in helping SMEs adopt the digital sharing economy. The literature review states a need for a strategy and guidelines in implementing the digital sharing economy for SMEs. This study is also supported by other studies in various countries, illustrating that the adoption of the digital sharing economy is not running smoothly. This study aims to understand the current conditions in the field regarding the readiness to change SMEs in adopting the digital sharing economy business model. This preliminary study used a snowballing technique to conduct semi-structured interviews with SME owners in the household consumption sector in Indonesia. The preliminary study’s findings include the readiness of SMEs to change in adopting the digital sharing economy business model, elements related to readiness on the digital sharing economy, and the need for guidance in adopting the digital sharing economy. This study concludes that the readiness of SMEs to switch to a digital sharing business model is still limited. Currently, there are no guidelines that direct the implementation of the digital sharing economy business model. Therefore, preparedness and guidelines are needed as a strategic step to help SMEs prepare to switch to a sharing economy business model.}

In this dynamic digital market, consumers can choose between different versions of movies that are available after their initial theatrical release. An analysis of weekly sales data of 1,397 movies with more than 50,000 observations, in a random effect control function generalized least square panel model, reveals an inverted U-shaped delay effect. That is, too short and too long delays after the initial cinematic release are both suboptimal. Price and delay interact positively with each other too, such that if the delay is too short, the negative influence of the price becomes amplified. By testing the effects of multiple other success factors, some of which have not been investigated before, this research also reveals pertinent, novel interactions of these variables with price and delay. Finally, to encourage the practical application of these comprehensive results, the authors present an interactive dashboard that managers can use to simulate the optimal price and delay for the different product versions.}

Building on the premise, previous literature primarily examined the causal relationships to describe the phenomenon of evolving digital payment technology in a varied context. However, limited studies explored user classification and profiling with some exceptions, principally stressing upon barely online and mobile-based banking segmentation contexts. Grounded in analyzing user taxonomy based on benefits-trust-behavioral linkage model from the purview of an emerging mobile-based digital payment market, this research aims to identify and test an a-priori approach to market segmentation of FMP platform users and profiling them based on perceived benefits, behavioral, and socio-demographic characterization. To analyze the model of users' classification, 550 valid online responses were received and employed a blended analytical approach of multivariate techniques (CFA, cluster analysis, discriminant function analysis) along with the bivariate technique of the Chi-square test for clustering procedures followed by resulting clusters' validation and their profiling. The three distinct segments are identified as ‘The Fintech Dubious,’ ‘The Cash Conservatives, ‘and ‘The Fintech Enthusiasts.’ The study also advances the current theoretical understanding of the trust based modified version of UTAUT with the associative framework of ‘perceived benefits-attitude, and intention’ by adding two additional cognitive constructs of perceived trust and perceived price value along with added socio-demographics (usage frequency and geographical area). Lastly, this timely study offers several unflinching implications for the practitioners of strategic marketing and policymakers for encouraging FMP usage.}

And still, the role of customer knowledge in organizational renewal, especially via explorative new product development (NPD), remains ambiguous. While existing literature generally emphasizes the value of customer knowledge, critics argue that a strong customer focus can also de-motivate and misguide exploration. This study adds clarity to our understanding of this tension by drawing from an intensive analysis of the corporate archives of a rapidly growing high-tech company. The authors trace the impacts of customer knowledge on twelve explorative NPD projects. The findings reveal three distinct mechanisms through which customer knowledge influences exploration: generating, guiding, and gatekeeping. The impact of customer knowledge on exploration depends on the selective deployment of these mechanisms. The authors further argue that managers should seek to find a fit between the deployment of customer knowledge mechanisms and the exploration project type in order to increase the likelihood of exploration project success.}

Using a longitudinal dataset (2010–2017) containing 360 market offerings and 39 acquisitions of Facebook and Twitter, we benchmark one PBO against another under temporal contingency. Our analysis reveals that PBOs that cater to multiple stakeholders in digital ecosystems use service innovations as part of their conformity (legitimacy argument of institutional theory) efforts and ecosystem facilitation as part of their differentiating (unique positioning and competitive distinction argument of strategic management) efforts. In addition, we find that PBOs that can better use their digital ecosystems for structural flexibility, controlled structural integrity, shared worldview, and reduced cognitive dissonance are likely to outperform those who do not. We discuss the implications of this research for PBOs, different user groups utilizing such PBOs. We conclude with a discussion on our contributions to the optimal distinctiveness perspective and R-A theory.}

With responses from 313 CEOs, we demonstrate that DSMP does overcome the innovativeness rigidities found in ordinary marketing planning capabilities. While DSMP is associated with higher levels of innovativeness, it also achieves higher levels of financial performance over ordinary marketing planning capabilities. Our findings seek to transform marketing planning practice by requiring that its implementation receives the attention of senior managers and combines reconfiguration processes that promote the renewal of plans and capabilities.}

The present conceptual research addresses this research gap by developing a comprehensive typology that explicates and unpacks the full variety of consumer involvement types in supply networks of contemporary business models. The three-dimensional typology developed contributes to literature by identifying and integrating the relevant dimensions, which have been addressed in prior research only implicitly or in a piecemeal manner. This elucidates the full range and variety of the phenomenon to researchers. For managers, the three-dimensional, cubic typology offers a business development tool, facilitating the identification of altogether 56 alternative business models, wherein consumers may serve as suppliers of various inputs, including work, effort, and entrepreneurial activity; goods; platform goods; natural resources and energy; data, information, and knowledge; attention and presence; as well as money and capital.}

Utilizing prospect theory, we argue that the two types of investors face unequal levels of uncertainty and are dissimilarly loss averse due to varying levels of knowledge and access to resources. This results in varying attitudes towards investment horizon, risk-taking, and preference for information sources. We find investor proclivity toward an NPPA depends on several factors, including the short-term abnormal return, the valence of coverage in media and analyst reports, the firm's risk profile, and the exploration emphasis of the firm. Moreover, we show that higher levels of institutional ownership ultimately contribute to new product success. The results hold implications for strategies that managers can employ to increase investor ownership within the firm to fund innovation.}

A survey of 336 Australian SME representatives reveals the critical role of suppliers’ sustainable competitive advantage (SCA) and affective commitment in mediating the relationship between service innovation and innovation adoption behavior. However, industry-relevant moderators in the form of technological turbulence and long-term orientation constrain the mediating effects. Specifically, perceived SCA has stronger mediating effects among short-term-oriented customers, whereas affective commitment has stronger mediating effects when technological turbulence is low. The findings provide useful insights for organizations in terms of capitalizing on their reputation and relationship with customers to encourage the adoption of innovation by SMEs.}

Findings suggest that FOMO is a powerful belongingness facilitator that can support the crowd investor’s self-determination strategies and thus their willingness to take part in a crowdfunding community, sharing in its values and beliefs. FOMO can be used by entrepreneurs to activate identification mechanisms through which they can create a loyal fan base. We conclude by proposing an entrepreneurial action plan to guide the entrepreneur in making the most of FOMO in equity crowdfunding ventures.}

The investigation draws on longitudinal and multiple sources of data from four Chinese multinational firms. Two follow traditional or incremental internationalization pathways, whilst the other two pursue rapid or accelerated internationalization. The study offers a more dynamic perspective to help understand the evolving nature of ambidexterity with respect to the routes of strategic product and market development options. In particularly, the findings reveal that incremental internationalization is characterized by structural ambidexterity combining product exploitation with market exploration at the initial stages, whereas accelerated internationalization is best explained by market exploration and exploitation (or market ambidexterity) when first entering foreign markets. Moreover, firms were found to maintain strategic priorities through structural and punctuated ambidexterity across product and market domains at later stages of internationalization. This study contributes to the dynamic perspective of strategic ambidexterity for seizing international opportunities among emerging market firms.}

abstract = {In a generalizable multi-year sample of U.S. counties, we demonstrate that horizontal scaling of social ventures is explained by technological factors including technological endowment (patent stock) and the availability of technological arbitrage opportunity, as well as the growth in these two factors over time. Both the technological endowment and the availability of technological arbitrage opportunity are positively related to social venture scaling. However, growth in the technological endowment eases the pressure on social entrepreneurs to act thus exerting negative impact on social venture scaling. At the same time, growth in the availability of technological arbitrage opportunity indicates that the relative efficiency within the county lags behind the frontier established by the leading counties, which may exacerbate social ills to which social entrepreneurs respond. Accordingly, it exerts a positive impact on social venture scaling observed.}

Using affordance theory and service-dominant logic as theoretical lenses, this study examines how chatbot affordances affect consumers' continuance intention through value-in-use. Data collected from 405 chatbot users of selected banks were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results reveal that chatbot affordances positively influence personalization and experience. Furthermore, personalization influences switching costs and psychological ownership, whereas experience affects psychological ownership. Moreover, switching costs affect continuance intention through inattentiveness to alternatives. Finally, psychological ownership influences customer citizenship behavior, which impacts continuance intention.}

While economic sustainability remains important, decision-makers must now navigate the transformation of their business models to incorporate environmental and social sustainability, driven by emerging regulations such as the European Union's Green Deal. This transition may initially appear as an additional task accompanied by potential investment costs and reduced profits. However, it also presents opportunities for economic growth through the creation of new value propositions, entry into untapped markets, access to novel customer segments, the provision of innovative services, and the facilitation of data-driven supply chains. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on sustainability as a pivotal future value proposition for companies and identifies potential pathways that can leverage its transformative potential.}

Intense competition among vloggers and channel owners for advertising revenue and sponsorship has led to the increasing use of clickbait-style thumbnails and titles with exaggerated sentiments to boost click-through rates. Drawing on cognitive schema theory, we analyzed the sentiments in video titles, thumbnails, and captions to examine their effects on video views. Our analysis of 16,215 YouTube video covers reveals that strong sentiments in thumbnails, whether positive or negative, lead to more views, whereas strong sentiments in captions have the opposite effect. Video titles with positive rather than negative sentiments generate more views. Sentiment markers such as punctuation, all capitals, and emoticons all contribute to more clicks. These findings highlight that the use of sentiment in video covers can have both a positive and a negative effect, which has significant implications for video marketing.}

Further, it also explores how the need for personal interaction induces webrooming intention among consumers. To understand the complex and varied nature of consumers' webrooming intentions, we propose using the Uses and Gratification Theory and Uncertainty Reduction Theory to gain insights into consumers' webrooming intentions by focusing on both dimensions, i.e., gratifications and the risks involved in webrooming. Based on an online survey a total of 334 responses were collected. The data was analyzed sequentially: SEM (structural equation modeling) and fsQCA (fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis). The finding supported the role of hedonic and utilitarian motives in online search, further influencing offline purchase intention (webrooming intention). fSQCA reported that the presence of online search, hedonic motives, and perceived risk insufficiency conditions help achieve the highest level of intention to purchase from offline stores. The need for personal interaction positively moderated the association between online search and intention to purchase from offline stores. This research contributes to key theoretical and managerial implications related to the decision-making of retail settings (online/offline).}

With this paper, we take a step in this direction. We first review key concepts and terms that are relevant to understanding how text analysis operates, as well as a new development in custom dictionary creation that expands the topics possible with text analysis. Next, we develop the FTTA grid, a new framework that enables text-derived metrics to inform actionable strategies for marketers. We present two real cases demonstrating how the FTTA grid can be employed in action. Finally, we discuss implications for both academics and marketing practitioners.}

But the outcomes of greater reliance on AI in peer-to-peer marketplaces, also known as lateral exchange markets (LEMs), might differ. Deploying AI likely improves outcomes for buyers and sellers (separately), as well as the effectiveness of their matching. In contrast, contingencies related to the power of the LEM and the presence and interaction of buyers and sellers (consociality) may evoke a dark side of AI. Guided by literature on LEMs, AI, and agency theory, the current work establishes buy- and sell-side tensions that arise when LEMs deploy AI. With a unique focus on buyers and sellers (cf. platforms) in LEMs and careful attention to the dark side, as well as the bright side, of AI, this article offers novel perspectives and implications for research and practice.}

Drawing on effectuation theory, we develop a research framework to examine the managerial reasoning during the adoption of marketing automation technology. Based on the results of a comparative multiple-case study on four large-sized industrial firms, we develop a maturity model of marketing automation adoption and show that even large-sized B2B companies apply effectual reasoning, which problematizes the rationality assumption in the technology adoption literature. Second, we show that during the adoption process, organizations' dominant reasoning mode follows an iterative pattern in which the adopting organization moves back and forth between effectuation and causation. Finally, we identify five key domains of marketing automation (customer knowledge, information systems infrastructure, analytics, interdepartmental dynamics and change management) and describe their gradual evolution at different stages of the adoption process.}

Sharing the same price point as economy private-label brands, the aim of discount venture brands is to attract customers with an overall look-and-feel that is not explicitly premium, yet is more attractive than that of conventional budget brands. Drawing on the self-congruity literature, the authors explore two questions: (1) whether customers perceive discount venture brands to offer greater value-for-money than conventional budget brands; and (2) whether such perceptions translate to customer impressions about the retailer brand? Results from a scenario-based experiment involving 505 participants suggest that, in comparison with conventional budget brands, discount venture brands may be less conducive to engendering favorable value-for-money perceptions; in short, discount venture brands may be less effective than conventional budget brands. This finding can be explained with a concept called self-congruity. Overall, we show that self-congruity acts as an indirect-only mediator of the path between the type of a brand and value-for-money perceptions of the brand. Particular findings are that self-congruity has a positive effect on value-for-money perceptions associated with conventional budget brands, discount venture brands, and the retailers selling those brands. However, for consumers with a preference for brands with a budget price point, self-congruity appears to be higher for conventional budget brands than discount venture brands; and this difference in self-congruity is more pronounced when shopping for others than when shopping for oneself.}

However, little is known about how this occurs in the case of institutions’ brand pages and about its impact on existing member relationships. In examining the role perception about other users of a brand page plays on focal user identity construction, we found seeing other users demonstrating engagement behavior and recognizing similarity led to institutional identification through an increased perception of brand page sociability and identification with the page. Institutional distinctiveness also mediated the impact of other-user engagement behavior on member-institution relationships. These findings suggest traditional institutions can use social media to increase the visibility and accessibility of member-owned identity resources so as to facilitate opportunities for focal members to reinforce their self-concepts. Findings contribute to knowledge on the dynamic group processes enabled by the various engagement tools on brand pages.}

Following growing attention from scholars and practitioners to AI-PRM, this study builds on the dynamic capability view (DCV) and absorptive capacity theory to develop a conceptual model to understand the requirements for a B2B firm's adoption of AI-PRM and its impact on business value. Since AI-PRM is still relatively new in scholarly research, there are no specific scales in the existing literature that could be used to capture specific factors and preconditions for its adoption, thus we explore a set of new metrics. We test the conceptual model using structural equation modeling with data from 427 B2B firms. Our results show that firms improve operational performance when an AI-PRM system is reflected in customized partner services and partner engagement, which in turn yields business value.}

The empirical results from a case study of an IJV located in Tunisia, formed by a French multinational and a Tunisian partner engaged in manufacturing dairy products show that the creation of ad hoc structures, the strengthening of the partners’ commitment and the emergence of transitional leadership ensured the survival and continuity of the IJV during an institutional crisis. We make two main contributions. First, we outline the ways in which an IJV can build organizational resilience by implementing effective governance mechanisms for the navigation of an institutional crisis. Second, we contribute to understanding the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region, by exploring the consequences of the Arab Spring on the business environment and the countries’ institutions.}

The findings revealed that usefulness, convenience of use, and push-to-use were the most critical aspects for achieving an efficient public e-tourism system that allows for value co-creation in that order of ranking. The findings also suggest that computer self-efficiency is the most critical factor in effectively establishing an e-tourism system followed by government push-to-use. In conclusion, the findings demonstrate that usefulness and ease-of-use backed by computer self-efficiency, result demonstrability, and output quality are vital for the efficient adoption of a public e-tourism system resulting in value co-creation in the UAE.}

Surplus food, despite its safety and quality parallels with regular food, suffers from low consumer awareness. Research indicates that nudging frameworks can improve intervention efficacy, prompting individuals to alter their preference selections. Previous studies have neglected to explore the impact mechanisms of individual and social nudging frameworks on the willingness to purchase surplus food, indicating a need for further inquiry. This study delves into the influence of individual and social nudging frameworks on consumers’ willingness to buy surplus food. Experimental validation illustrates that social norm-based nudges, in comparison to individual norm-based nudges, notably increase the willingness to purchase surplus food, with moral entanglement serving as a mediating factor. Moreover, the influence of these nudging frameworks on the willingness of highly cognitive consumers to purchase surplus food outweighs that on low cognitive consumers. This research contributes to advancing the understanding of surplus food and food wastage.}

Our findings led us to the conclusion that, due to a conversion of mindset, a consumer's willingness to pay for a subsequent purchase will be higher in an unplanned precedent purchase situation than in a planned precedent purchase situation. For the planned purchase situation, a consumer's willingness to pay for the subsequent purchase did not turn out to be significant despite the use of the justification heuristic. For the unplanned precedent purchase situation, however, a consumer's willingness to pay for the subsequent purchase was found to be lower in the situation with the justification heuristic than in the situation without.

We test how the relationship between consumer values and trust varies in conjunction with previous organic food consumption experience and consumer age on a sample of 1011 Australian consumers. The findings reveal that values related to self-symbolism and self-transcendence are positively associated with trust, whereas values related to security and openness to change show no relationship with trust. Furthermore, it was found that consumer age strengthens the consumer values–trust link in the case of self-symbolic and security values.}

This study also strives to investigate users' hedonic and utilitarian attitudes towards using social robots.

Social robots follow social rules and behaviors which make them different from other kinds of robots. They often behave like social partners to humans and have features such as eye-gaze, speech recognition, auto-gestures, and so on. Social robots use different types of sensitive data from the users which could pose security challenges and privacy threats. Not many studies have dealt with human–robot interactions (HRI) from security, privacy, social norms, and personal norms perspectives. With the existing literature as well as privacy calculus, motivational theory, and theory of planned behavior (TPB), a model has been developed conceptually, which was then validated using a sample of 403 users contemplating using social robots in the coming days. The study found that both users' hedonic and utilitarian attitudes impact significantly and positively their usage of social robots.}

Influencer marketing, which involves the use of endorsements from individuals with large social media followings, has emerged as an effective advertising tactic for reaching Christians on social media. However, there is a lack of research exploring the complexities of religion in advertising messaging, especially in the context of influencer marketing. To fill this gap, we apply the social identity, persuasion knowledge, and symbolic interactionism theories to propose relationships between message cues in Christian influencers' social media posts and follower engagement. We analyzed 20,068 Facebook posts, 20,517 tweets, and 13,857 Instagram posts to determine the impact of three categories of message cues on engagement. Across multiple studies, key findings indicate religious and promotional cues increase and decrease engagement across platforms, respectively. The impact of social media cues, such as hashtags and mentions, differs depending on the platform.}

For the well-known, fast-moving consumer goods/consumer-packaged goods (FMCG/CPG) food brands typically placed in local TV programming—the context of this article—the management problem of overfocusing on brand exposure hinders gaining brand choice, the ultimate strategic goal of marketing. Managers’ preconditioning, ease of measuring, and assumptions about the value of exposure contribute to their subtle placements becoming blatant or in other problems, as when other promotional devices, like a television commercial or program sponsorships billboard, get bundled into the same TV episode as the company’s own product placement. The higher brand exposure gained can evoke negative mental outcomes in consumers, weakening influences on brand choice. An experiment with a large sample of grocery shoppers supports such an outcome. More strategic value can also be gained from product placements in general by their use longitudinally, in-between campaigns of TV commercials, as an instructive tool and through normalizing a brand’s role in a consumer’s life. We provide eight checkpoints for marketers to consider when planning to use product placement to gain value for their brands.}

abstract = {In this research, using a capability perspective, we first define innovation based, strategic flexibility (ISF) as consisting of three lower-level capabilities- market sensing, resource reconfiguration, and proactiveness; then link it to new-product/innovation outcomes, and develop a new metric of ISF that is input–output based. This metric captures a firm’s realized flexibility in translating market opportunities into innovation output. We then examine the role of CEO ties with marketing and R&D in driving a firm's ISF. Combining survey data of 191 CEOs with objective performance data, we find that (a) ISF is positively influenced by the frequency and duration of the CEO's relationship with the two functional units, but negatively influenced by CEO's relationship closeness, and (b) ISF contributes to future profit growth of firms. We test the robustness of our findings to the potential violation of sequential-ignorability assumption as defined in the causal mediation literature and find the results to be robust. The results provide insights into the role of CEO characteristics in driving innovation, and upper echelon’s contributions to marketing.}

This research extends understanding of referral behavior by providing fresh insights into giving eWOM as a prepurchase behavior using the case of online group buying. Using a between-subjects Solomon experiment, this research finds that consumers are more likely to give prepurchase eWOM for online group purchases for utilitarian products paired with affective messages and larger discount prices than for hedonic products promoted under the same combination of marketing stimuli. This research also furnishes actionable guidelines for marketers to develop marketing-mix strategies that encourage target customers to actively give prepurchase eWOM for online group purchases, including the boundaries in situations in which additional investments beyond what is required do not further enlarge the size of online buyer aggregation.}

All relevant data were collected from 197 employees in the Chinese logistics industry. Partial least squares–structural equation modelling technique was performed. The obtained empirical results supported top management support and compatibility as critical factors for the adoption of BDPA. Moreover, BDPA exhibited positive influence on SCC and SCP. Additionally, SCC mediated the relationship between BDPA and SCP. This study presented significant theoretical contributions and provided guidelines that can benefit policymakers and organisations in the efforts of implementing BDPA for enhanced SCP.

Our research addresses this gap by studying how emotional arousal varies throughout a service encounter. Drawing from the psychology literature, we identify certain features (or patterns) that characterize how arousal varies throughout a service encounter and predict how they may affect customer approach response (e.g., spending, unplanned purchases). We explore the effect of these features in field studies in two stores using a psychophysiological measure (electrodermal activity) to capture arousal over time. We find that (1) the highest arousal level reached during the encounter and (2) the skewness of the distribution of arousal levels (i.e., the frequency of lower arousal levels relative to higher ones) predict customer approach response. This paper opens new avenues for understanding customers from an emotional perspective, which can improve the customer experience in service encounters.}

However, such woke activism can lead to consumer backlash, hence carrying significant risks. Brands struggle to convince the public that their virtue-signaling efforts are authentic. Thus, this study explores the dimensions of woke branding authenticity, adopting an interpretive inductive research approach, and conducting content analysis. This study identifies six dimensions for woke activism authenticity: social context independency, inclusion, sacrifice, practice, fit, and motivation. By exploring different drivers of woke activism authenticity, this study proposes as a conceptual model, the woke activism authenticity framework, highlighting the interactions among the woke authenticity dimensions. The findings make conceptual contributions and offer several managerial recommendations toward woke authenticity and neutralizing the perception of inauthenticity.}

Accordingly, firm-generated content (FGC) has become a popular tool, allowing brands to use various content types to show consumers sharable, informative, and comment-worthy information. From the customer's perspective, this content type competes with, and complements, user-generated content (UGC). As current research focuses mainly on UGC, several questions regarding the social media marketing role of FGC, remain unanswered. Hence, this study aims to explain how FGC influences customer purchase intention, using online survey data. We use partial least squares structural equation modeling to analyze the data and determine users' attitudes toward FGC. The findings suggest that FGC negatively influences purchase intention and has little effect on brand equity and attitude. These results challenge marketers to rethink their online marketing strategies.}

In particular, we argue that buyer WTPP represents the industrial brands' competitiveness since buying firms express such strong preferences for the industrial sellers’ products and services compared to competitors that they are willing to pay price premiums. Based on data from 454 US-based industrial buyers, our findings generally support the proposed hypotheses. Our research sheds light on how industrial sellers can build their brand competitiveness.

The authors empirically investigate the model through a cross-sectional survey of 141 Taiwanese electronics firms. Drawing from the coalignment perspective, these firms are distinguished into four strategic groups labeled as EO (high EO and low AO), AO (low EO and high AO), EA (high EO and high AO), and CO (low EO and low AO) firms. Empirical results suggest that the four groups of firms significantly differ in terms of NPD process characteristics (decision-making flexibility, market-focused learning, and internally focused learning), program characteristics (product program meaningfulness and newness), and performance outcome (new product success). Theoretical and managerial implications of the results are demonstrated.}

Second, using multi-country data, we test the validity of the OBC-SiteQUAL and CE measurement models, and the theoretical framework. Results indicate that the newly conceived OBC-SiteQUAL construct, underpinned by various web-based cues related to affective elements, brand interaction and customer-to-customer interaction, positively influences CE, whereas brand involvement partially influences CE. Third, we examine how these variables translate to behavioural loyalty outcomes. Empirically, a consistent pattern across the country samples indicates that OBC-SiteQUAL can affect behavioural loyalty by enhancing CE. Thus, we reliably confirm the mediating effect of CE (O) between OBC-SiteQUAL (S) and behavioural loyalty (R). Fourth, we found that the impact of OBC-SiteQUAL and brand involvement on CE differs between younger and older Gen Y consumers. These findings inform the optimisation of precise digital content marketing activities to enhance customer-brand relationships.}

The results indicate that human brand authenticity is a significant predictor of brand love, although its predictive power varies according to the type of human brand. Authenticity exerts the most influence in the field of politics, followed by music, movies, and sports. In social media and business, human brand authenticity shows no significance toward brand love. Although existing branding scholarship identifies authenticity as a predictor of positive marketing outcomes, the current study’s findings uncover a boundary condition concerning the context in which the human brand performs. In addition, brand love can be materialized through increased purchase intention of human brands’ self-branded products, allowing the human brand to benefit from passive income and brand-building opportunities.}

Building on cognitive-affective personality system theory, we examine the role of consumer personality traits as drivers of fair trade engagement and its subsequent impact on ethically-minded behavior concerning circular economy issues. Adopting a mixed-method approach, comprising a quantitative survey among 323 consumers in the UK and India and a qualitative study among 18 British consumers, we found that extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness positively affect consumer fair trade engagement, whereas neuroticism has a negative effect, and openness has no significant impact. Consumer fair trade engagement was subsequently revealed to positively influence ethically-minded behavior related to circular economy. The association between consumer fair trade engagement and ethically-minded behavior was stronger in older, more educated, and high-income consumers, whereas gender had no moderating role.}

The viability of online C2C platforms depends on the willingness of lenders to list their possessions for rent. We suggest that psychological mechanisms related to emotional attachment may underlie this decision. Specifically, we show that emotional attachment predicts lenders’ concerns about property preservation, such that higher levels of attachment will be associated with a relatively stronger preference for policies focused on product protection (i.e., policies that provide assurance that the product will not be damaged) versus financial guarantees (i.e., policies that provide financial restitution in the event of product damage). Our results extend prior literature by providing insights into how emotional attachment influences lenders’ participation in C2C rental platforms. These findings further highlight practical interventions that platforms might use to increase lender participation. Our work informs practitioners about motivational and behavioral psychological phenomena underlying the emerging C2C business model.}

Based on a two-stage hybrid analytic methodology, the proposed model was validated empirically using a sample of 951 participants. First, partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to identify the significant drivers of PMPS acceptance predictors. Artificial neural networks (ANN) were then used to rank the relative influence of the significant adoption drivers obtained in the previous step. The PLS results indicate that the extended DTPB provides a solid theoretical framework for studying the adoption of PMPS. The results of the PLS-ANN sensitivity analysis confirmed the PLS results regarding the importance of the determinants' of normative and controlling customers’ beliefs, although there were some contradictions concerning the determination of customer attitudes and behavioural intentions towards PMPS usage. The results are discussed and implications are offered.}

This research delves deep into the interplay of parasocial interaction, vicarious expression, electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM), and the bandwagon effect, all converging towards influencing online purchase intention. Through two controlled quasi-experiments—with 232 participants in Study 1 and 252 in Study 2—we offer a fresh perspective rooted in parasocial relationship theory. Study 1 delineates how parasocial interactions heighten the impact of vicarious expressions, leading to amplified bandwagon effect and pronounced eWOM. The study further corroborates the mediating role of vicarious expression between parasocial interaction and the bandwagon effect. Study 2 sheds light on the cyclical nature of this process, illustrating that eWOM, in turn, reinforces the bandwagon effect, driving online purchase intention. These findings underscore the potent influence of parasocial interactions on online purchasing behaviors, suggesting that brands can strategically leverage such interactions to enhance eWOM and harness the bandwagon effect. Moreover, recognizing the cyclical reinforcement between eWOM and the bandwagon effect offers marketers a unique opportunity to amplify and sustain online purchase momentum.}

Song lyrics of prominent pop music artists, Madonna and Taylor Swift, are suggested to illustrate respective characteristics. Lady Gaga is held up as an intermediary between Madonna's deconstructive and Taylor's reconstructive selves. Themes of reputation, revenge and romance highlight how Swift experiments with re-compositions of self in relation to surroundings and vice versa. Her fabulations and manipulations thereof are supported by processes of communality, publicity and transition. The rise of Taylor Swift as a post-postmodern paragon provides insight into where the post-postmodern turn might be observed and how it may impact marketing theory and practice.}

Studying this combination of customer technology (smartphone) and store technology (MAR) is thus key to reviving physical retail. In this context, this paper tests a Cognitive-Affective-Normative model to explain the intention of MAS consumers to use MAR in a physical store and analyze the moderating effect of gender on this relationship. The model is tested on a sample of 388 MAS men and 417 MAS women. The results show that the main antecedents for MAS men come from the model's cognitive dimension (“performance expectancy,” “effort expectancy”), while MAS women's acceptance is most conditioned by the cognitive dimension (“performance expectancy”) and normative dimension (“social influence”). These findings have theoretical implications for reviving the physical retail sector taking gender differences into account.}

Analyzing a unique dataset that combines survey and archival financial data from 318 private firms, this study finds that MA is positively associated with sales growth for firms with relatively strong AC. This relationship becomes negative for firms with weak AC. Results are robust when the additive and multiplicative terms of exploitation and exploration are controlled for.

abstract = {The lack of ability, knowledge, and resources at a national level leads companies to choose international strategic alliances (ISAs) as an appropriate solution to enter the global markets. In this regard, selecting appropriate partners is a fundamental step in reducing the risks and costs of these alliances. This article analyzes international partner selection scenarios using agent-based simulations in Iran's biopharmaceutical industry. In line with the goal of this research, a complete understanding of the failure and success of collaboration product innovation is presented. First, the critical/key success factors (KSFs) in international strategic alliances were identified through a literature review (LR) and screened via Fuzzy Delphi. Next, selected factors were weighted by fuzzy SWARA (Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis) and considered as simulation inputs for international partner selection. The simulation results indicated the critical role of the knowledge-matching degree and complementary resources and the insignificant impact of the company's reputation, government support, and experience in the international alliance. Furthermore, we found that pharmaceutical and biotech companies should emphasize their partner's complementary resources and develop an evaluation system to measure the knowledge-matching degree of their foreign partners in ISA. Eventually, this paper provides practical and applied solutions for biopharmaceutical industry managers to analyze business partners. The article also adds to the debate on ISAs in biopharmaceutical industries.}

The second section presents research prepositions that facilitate the investigation of consumer attitude persuasion through virtual reality and augmented reality advertisements. The authors identified six research prepositions that facilitate the investigation of consumer attitude persuasion through these advertisements based on the literature.Presented in the third section of this paper is a detailed future research agenda organized by two main research paths: central and peripheral. Moreover, advertisement quality, demographic differences, and the technological context of virtual and augmented reality advertisements helped to facilitate central route persuasion. Variables such as source credibility, social presence, and message content in virtual reality and augmented reality advertisements were found as the persuasion factors under the peripheral route. Therefore, this study provides a method to examine consumer attitudes through virtual reality and augmented reality advertisements using the social psychology theory of elaboration likelihood modelling (ELM).}

Apart from these resources, we argue that firms can also access reputational assets of their alliance partner, based on the partner’s Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance. However, the alliance literature overlooks the effect of partner’s ESG performance on shareholder value creation. In the present study, we build on the knowledge differentials logic to propose that deviations in a firm’s ESG-specific knowledge and expertise compared to those of its alliance partner—what we term “ESG distinctiveness”—can affect a firm’s shareholder value. Using data on alliance formation announcements by public U.S. firms between 2003 and 2020, we find that firms gain value from forming alliances with high ESG performance partners. The effect of ESG distinctiveness on shareholder value due to alliance formation is stronger for firms with greater prior partnering experience.}

The authors use the framework to evaluate scholarly efforts during the 1986–2019 period and propose a broader view on segmentation as a continuous process. Marketers can benefit from the study by adopting four activities for segmenting markets: (1) pre-segmentation, (2) segmentation, (3) implementation, and (4) evaluation.

With four phases and 1027 Chinese respondents, this study followed rigorous scale development steps. Phase 1 conceptualized the ASP based on previous research. Phase 2 involved the development of measures, including generating items and validating content through individual interviews and expert assessments. Phase 3 involved ASP scale purification and refinement via exploratory factor analysis. In Phase 4, a new survey sample was collected to test the reliability, and validity through confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. The findings indicated that ASP is a multidimensional construct with five dimensions: social affability, empathy, responsiveness, communication versatility, and competence. Additionally, the developed scale showed sufficient reliability and validity. This study guides the design, development, and deployment of AI beings to enhance the consumer experience in AI services.}

Despite being high-risk countries, such countries receive the attention of foreign firms, which in many cases offer services that are vital for daily life and improve local productivity. Within the overall conceptual focus of peace engineering, we analyze the operations and activities of six Turkish firms operating in the violence-hit and fragile countries of Congo, Ethiopia, Iraq, Morocco (the Western Sahara region), Somalia, and Sudan. The findings indicate that foreign firms operating in fragile and conflict-affected countries, along with achieving business goals, contribute significantly to the skills development of local employees and establish legitimacy through forging social connections and adopting corporate social responsibility activities. Their support for skills development resulted in career advancement opportunities and, in some cases, entrepreneurial ventures that were initiated by local employees. We argue that, despite precarious and unpredictable conditions, the operations of such firms can provide economic incentives as well as increased well-being and long-term stability in such contexts. Thus, the findings of this study have important implications for post-conflict recovery and local economic development through skills formation and entrepreneurial start-ups.}

It is a challenge that vexes many special interest operators, in particular, that are trying to carve out businesses in a micro and macro competitive environment that seems inimical to their success. They face the dual challenge of, at the micro level, trying to create awareness of their product offerings in a destination that does not see value in that type of product, and at the macro level, having to compete with similar products in other destinations where the destination image and product offerings are compatible. This paper discusses the dual nature of that challenge, by proposing two frameworks. The first presents a continuum of the relationship between destination image and tourism products, while the second presents a conceptual model outlining challenge facing products when non-alignment of destination image occurs.}

Based on the inductive constructive method, and drawing on the recent entrepreneurial CSR literature, stakeholder and internationalization theories, we suggest that managing ecological stakeholder relationship is intimately connected to the idea of creating value for stakeholders through creating ethical relationship with them. In this context, this study posits that with increasing emphasis from the society to assure firms' accountability to multiple stakeholders including the ecological stakeholders, the complexity of relational pressures is greater, when a firm operates in cross-border markets. Furthermore, such pressures are also higher in complex stakeholder relations, when a firm attempts to integrate internationalization and stakeholder theories in CSR-based value creating parameters, as a meaningful relationship with the ecological setting, as a key stakeholder in international markets. In this context, we have proposed propositions at the intersection of the aforementioned theoretical areas. Our synthesis offers novel insights on how firms could proactively manage their relationship with the ecological settings that is a core stakeholder in cross-border market to create stakeholder value.}

However, direct customers' demand for business marketers' offerings is often ‘derived demand’, i.e., heavily influenced by the needs of their own downstream customers. Consequently, scholars suggest that marketers may benefit from incorporating these customers' customer needs as a third segmentation base, distinct from but possibly interrelated to the two bases of direct customers' needs and behaviors. However, extant joint segmentation models are limited to two-bases. Focusing on the addition of a third customers' customer needs basis, a new B2B joint segmentation model is proposed, allowing for three interrelated segmentation bases. The model is first validated in Monte Carlo simulation studies and then applied to segmenting the business customers (advertisers) of a US newspaper publisher seeking to enable more precisely targeted selling effort allocation and communications strategies. The model uncovered joint segments of business customers based on their behaviors, needs, and downstream customers' needs. Results demonstrate the advantage of the model that yields actionable segments of customers with similar downstream customer needs. Finally, model relevance and feasibility in contemporary B2B markets is confirmed in a qualitative study with experts in various industries.}

Drawing on relational exchange theory, this study explores the effects of buyer trust asymmetry and supplier trust asymmetry on changes in supplier opportunism over time, and further examines the moderating roles of legal support and regulatory uncertainty. Empirical results from 229 buyer–supplier dyads in China reveal that when buyer trust surpasses supplier trust, trust asymmetry leads to increased supplier opportunism over time; yet when the supplier’s trust exceeds that of the buyer, trust asymmetry results in decreased supplier opportunism. Moreover, legal support weakens the effects of buyer and supplier trust asymmetry, and regulatory uncertainty magnifies the influence of buyer trust asymmetry. Our findings shed light on the complexity of interfirm trust and the dark side of business-to-business relationships, offering valuable insights for relationship marketing research.}

abstract = {This research investigates the effect of knowledge on the perception of internationalization barriers and the intention to internationalize among emerging market small/medium enterprise (SME) managers. Drawing from social cognitive theories in entrepreneurship, the study tests a paradoxical effect of knowledge on a sample of 150 managers. The model predicts that the characteristics specific to emerging market SMEs will reverse the traditionally positive relationship of knowledge on internationalization intention commonly found in the literature. Consistent with the hypothesis, the results indicate that knowledge relates negatively to internationalization intention. Additionally, the effect of perceived barriers on intention to internationalize becomes positive when perceived international market knowledge is higher. By clarifying the role of knowledge in the emerging market SME context, the study adds novel understanding to the key concept of internationalization knowledge.}

Based on action-research methodology, existing taxonomies of online product catalog at ERP and CCMS systems were analyzed, an ontology of updated taxonomies was created using Protégé tool and validated by experts. This solution was anchored in some Industry 4.0 and 5.0 pillars, by formalizing smart manufacturing knowledge in an interoperable way between multiple systems and allowing a tailored customer experience, based on interactive products and hyper customization. The organization can now be more efficient in managing individual or integrated products as complex modular systems and in communicating with customers.}

These are perceived to have considerable impacts on relationship management in terms of consumer buying behavior and psychology in the B2B context. This concept has dramatically changed the B2B marketing dynamics, blurring the age-old boundaries between B2B and B2C marketing contexts. With this background, we attempted to understand how the three Indian cultural attributes can impact the B2B relationship. This study highlights that consumers’ buying behavior, in the B2B context, is influenced by their brand identification, purchase engagement, and prestige sensitivity. A conceptual model has been developed and the model has been validated statistically by a survey involving 364 respondents. The study reveals that jugaad, visvaas, and chalta hai considerably affect the business relationship performance of the MNCs doing business with Indian firms, especially on B2B consumer buying behavior and psychology.}

Data were collected online from 272 upper-level management of Chinese supply chain organizations. The results reveal that pre-adoption factors, including traceability, transparency, organizational readiness, coercive pressure, and normative pressure, positively influence BT adoption, whereas security concerns negatively affect it. The findings further indicate the positive impact of actual use on infusion and performance, and information technology alignment moderates these associations in the post-adoption stage. Interestingly, the moderating results of firm size demonstrate a significant difference in security concerns and organizational readiness, where large organizations have higher readiness and lower security concerns than smaller firms.}

We explore these recent strategic decision episodes to provide an in-depth and nuanced understanding of intuition in strategic decision-making, contributing to the literature in two important ways. First, we build theory concerning the contextual triggers that foster the use of intuition, and second, we derive insights into the contextual factors that render intuition more, as well as less effective. We offer a series of theoretical and practical insights whereby intuition can be leveraged as a vital input to the strategic decision-making process.}

While marketing research generally indicates that these investments should pay off, recent experiences from managerial practice suggest that such beneficial payoffs may not necessarily arise. To examine the effects of implementing IDSTs on B2B firm performance, we differentiate between customer-sensing and customer-linking IDSTs: while customer-sensing IDST has the primary purpose of identifying new sales opportunities (e.g., predictive analytics) early within the B2B sales funnel, the purpose of customer-linking IDST (e.g., augmented reality application) is to close sales opportunities. The results of a multi-data study involving 314 B2B firms confirm that implementing customer-sensing and customer-linking IDST can exhibit a complementary, positive effect on firm profit, but this effect strongly varies with the sales task environment in terms of firms’ offering and demand complexity. In unfavorable conditions, extensive digitalization in B2B sales can even harm firm profit. These findings contribute to sales technology research and the literature on marketing capabilities and guide managers on how to ensure successful sales digitalization.}

Using a sample of 14,761 firm-year observations covering 2,193 listed firms in China, we found that the influence of Buddhism is negatively associated with the executive-employee pay gap. In addition, the negative effect is stronger when firms operate in regions with better legal development and when they have high media coverage but becomes weaker when executives have overseas experience. These findings confirm the mitigating effect of Buddhist influence on inter-class pay inequity and highlight the contingent role of institutions.}

An online survey and in-depth interviews were conducted with employees working in different areas of the tourism and hospitality sector in Sweden. The results suggest that many employees perceive their jobs as creative, and further indicate that the possibility of being creative and innovative at work is an important driver for employees to stay with their current employer. This factor also influences their intention to recommend employment at the company to others. Moreover, the results of this study suggest that the economic value in terms of total compensation is important for employees in the tourism and hospitality sector, as it affects intention to stay as well as likelihood to recommend.}

By considering the theories, contexts, characteristics, and methodologies used in LP research, this study (1) paints the most comprehensive picture of the field to date and (2) develops a future research agenda to help advance the field further. Our review reveals that existing studies mostly rely on status-based, inertia-based, or relationship-based mechanisms to theoretically explain LP-related effects, while multi-theoretical perspectives are rare. LP research focuses strongly on a few key industries, such as retail, airlines, and hotels, but lacks insights into the design and outcomes of LPs in online and B2B contexts. Furthermore, we diagnose a need for more research on the role of competition among LPs and the impact of recent technological advances on LP management.}

Highlighting media differences in eWOM, we utilize the online disinhibition effect and social sharing of emotion theory to investigate the consequences of consumption emotion for consumers’ eWOM behavior and emotion-specific media preferences (social networking sites [SNSs] vs. review sites). Experimental results identify emotional intensity as the key driver of consumers’ eWOM-giving intention on both media, whereas emotional valence shows media-specific effects on eWOM-giving. Satisfaction demonstrates a ‘positivity bias’ in consumers’ eWOM-giving, but only on SNSs. Expressive suppression also regulates the impact of emotional intensity on eWOM-giving intention. We push the boundaries of valence-centered assertions in eWOM research and advance theoretical understanding of consumers’ eWOM behavior through the lenses of emotion and media differences.

A two-stage analytical approach with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Neural Network (NN) analysis to bring out social media's distinctive and confirmatory influence on mobile banking consumers. Data from 482 respondents in the age group of 18 years to 30 years (the young consumers) from India was analyzed for social media influence on different cognitive stages of mobile banking acceptance. Results show the increasing tendency of social media influence with increasing cognitive level. Among the four cognitive stages (Attention, Interest, Desire, and Action- AIDA model) of m-banking adoption, Action and Interest stages are the most influenced stages by the social media, followed by Desire and Attention. This research provides a two-stage analytical approach by combining “SEM and NN” to assess the impact of the integration of AIDA constructs. We develop an original integrated model which outlines the phenomenon of the diffusion of information from social media on different cognitive stages of young mobile banking consumers.}

However, with the increasing number of online healthcare communities, digitalized social support requires further scrutiny. Additionally, it remains unclear which type of social support contributes most to a support seeker's psychological well-being and happiness. Drawing on the theory of social support, this research investigates the interactional effect of the social support types and sources of social support on one's well-being and happiness in the digitalized healthcare environment. Employing two experiments involving an online healthcare community of Chinese parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), this research also examines the mediating effect of social relationship coping efficacy. The findings suggest that emotional support in the digital environment results in a higher level of well-being and happiness than informational support offers, and such significant differences are due to individual variations in social relationship coping efficacy. Further, counterintuitive to the received wisdom, emotional support from community members results in higher well-being and happiness than such support from close family members. The study has important implications for healthcare community managers and close family members by encouraging emotional support that leads to increased well-being and happiness.}

The results indicate that collectivism and hedonism have positive effect on trust in CRM campaign, but individualism and utilitarianism have negative effect on trust in CRM campaign. Moreover, the result shows that trust in the CRM campaign had significant positive effect on donation intentions. We further have investigated the role of cognitive process and demonstrated the moderating effect of creativity on the impact of trust in CRM campaign and donation intentions, such that the higher level of creativity led to higher level of donation intentions, if consumers have trust in CRM campaign. This research offers marketers and advertising professionals’ practical insights to design effective CRM campaigns. Additionally, it assists NPO managers to understand the crucial role of trust and creativity in CRM campaigns and its positive impact on donation intentions.

However, little is known about the ODE construct and the effects of applying experiential marketing on destination websites on ODEs. A scale was developed and applied in a web-based experiment to measure ODEs and to enhance the understanding of the dimensionality of this construct. The travel inspiration phase was simulated and the ODEs of three experimental groups exposed to different websites of the destination Reunion Island were compared. The experiment was conducted with a representative sample of German internet users. Findings indicate that when surfing on a destination website in the inspiration phase, the users’ ODE is holistic and cannot be differentiated into theoretically relevant dimensions (e.g. sensory or affective). Moreover, the application of experiential marketing had a statistically significant, small effect on ODEs when adjusted for aspects of personal relevance. Yet, ODE differences between high and medium levels of experiential marketing were negligible. Accordingly, DMOs should realize that experiential marketing enhances ODEs, but beyond a certain level, additional complex multi-media elements do not necessarily further increase the experiential effect. For the important assessment of experiential user reactions, the developed ODE scale provides a first approach.}

We analyze our model on a sample of 125 Croatian exporting SMEs. Our findings indicate that innovativeness has an inverted U-shape relationship with profitability under lower MD and higher PD. On the other hand, adaptability shows to have a negative linear relationship with profitability under higher MD and an inverted U-shape relationship under higher PD. This study contributes by providing concrete guidelines how to effectively manage DECs by aligning them with diversification strategies.}

For this prior studies were referred and a conceptual framework involving proactive, interactive two-way stakeholder engagement process between women enterprises and stakeholders; divided into three interconnected parts; along with institutional support is suggested. Stakeholder engagement as a long term growth strategy to build competitive advantage calls for collaborative endeavors, wherein stakeholders work-together to pursue mutually-beneficial, multitudinous goals, which should encourage innovative women entrepreneurial initiatives. Furthermore, the suggested framework, as an interactive, two-way, continuous process interlinking the variables, would help management to work at increasing collaborative value creations through innovative women entrepreneurial ventures.}

Among their activities, the successful selection of new technologies is becoming a highly critical and complex challenge in the Technology Management Process. The problem underlying the right selection of new generations of technologies is, from a methodological perspective, linked to key heterogeneous (technological, economic, human, and organizational) factors. Even though previous research has focused on the selection of technologies within the industrial sector, there is little research on the selection of technology at R&D Institutions and, in particular, at R&D Centers. In this research, a Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)-based evaluation model for decision-making (MIVES), adaptable to one or several technologies, is therefore, employed. In such complex scenarios, MCDM models are a suitable approach to decision-making. The model is then applied to a real case study, in which the evaluation of a new technology at a Spanish R&D Center specializing in manufacturing is analyzed.}

In Study 1, we utilised cross-sectional data collected from 468 managers from various industries. In study 2, we employed longitudinal data in a three-wave longitudinal utilising a cross-lagged panel model. Study 1 indicated that data acquisition and tool acquisition are key drivers in adopting marketing analytics. Marketing analytics use has stronger effect on customer agility when market turbulence is high. They also revealed that the influence of customer agility on customer satisfaction in such conditions is stronger. Study 2 revealed that marketing analytics use at time point T1 has a significant and positive influence on customer agility at time point T2, while customer agility at time point T2 has a significant and positive influence on customer satisfaction at time point T3. These findings indicate strong temporal effects between marketing analytics use, customer agility, and customer satisfaction. The findings suggest that researchers should look beyond direct effects of marketing analytics use and shift their attention on how a marketing analytics can be leveraged to enable and support dynamic capabilities and customer satisfaction.}

While the importance of coopetition-oriented mindsets, paradoxical frames, and cognitive and emotional capabilities is recognized for successful management of these challenges, more research is needed to understand how individual managers frame coopetition. The framing perspective is important, because it shows how managers make sense of and try to influence their own behavior as well as that of others. Utilizing a qualitative approach, we analyzed 26 interviews with top managers from 24 organizations within the same healthcare ecosystem. As a result, we develop a framework outlining three distinct paths to framing coopetition: conscious denial, acceptance, and unconscious denial, along with five specific framings. Our findings highlight the impact of these framings on managers' ability to manage coopetition effectively and the conditions shaping the different framings. Through these insights, this research advances our understanding of coopetition management and underscores the crucial role of context, enriching both theoretical discourse and practical application.}

abstract = {This study's objective is to investigate how a business can achieve data-driven market effectiveness through the sustained application of a customer analytics capability to its operations. Despite the abundance of literature on retail technology management, empirical evidence on the effectiveness of a customer analytics capability in promoting sustainable market performance within retail business operations remains scarce. This study presents a model of a sustained customer analytics capability in the context of competitive, data-rich retail business processes, drawing on grounded market orientation capability theory. The study employs a taxonomy of explanation and prediction from an epistemological perspective, employing predominantly positivist methods, where data analysis validates the conceptual customer analytics capability and its sustained critical outcomes. In addition, the study discusses the significant contributions of its findings regarding the acceleration of retail business operational performance in a big data environment and also provides future research directions to resolve any limitations of the current study.}

We obtained valid data from 233 respondents using the survey-based approach, which was then utilized for PLS-SEM and NCA analyses. The study's PLS-SEM analysis revealed that perceived SMM activities, such as informativeness and word-of-mouth (WoM), positively influence customer engagement in OFDAs. This engagement, in turn, predicts important behavioral outcomes, including co-production value, customer referrals, purchase intention, and customer satisfaction. The NCA results further indicate that informativeness, trendiness, and WoM are essential for driving customer engagement in Saudi-based OFDAs. These findings provide valuable insights for enhancing customer engagement and behavioral outcomes in the field of OFDAs, utilizing both PLS-SEM and NCA methodologies.}

This study investigates the impact of clustering on the firm’s short-term financial performance, measured as return on assets (ROA). It also assesses the moderating effects of the firm’s share of ownership and marketing spend. An examination of quarterly data of the five large publicly listed quick service restaurant firms operating more than 46,000 outlets across 50 US states from 2018 to 2021 finds that clustering hurts a firm's ROA. The share of ownership partially helps, whereas marketing spend registers a more robust moderating impact in improving a firm’s ROA. Further, our post hoc analysis finds a significant effect of clustering on a firm’s long-term financial performance measured as stock returns. These results provide important insights to scholars, business owners, and managers.}

To address this gap, the authors apply the Elaboration Likelihood Model to propose that linguistic characteristics of the text within influencers’ affiliate marketing posts motivate either peripheral or central route processing, which in turn impacts behavioral interactions with the content. To empirically test these relationships, text mining and natural language processing are used to construct a large dataset of influencers’ affiliate marketing posts from their Instagram feeds. The analysis reveals certain linguistic styles can enhance engagement, while others negatively impact these behaviors. In addition to advancing understanding of influencer affiliate marketing and social media engagement, the findings offer important insights for both brands and influencers participating in affiliate marketing.}

We also examined the impact of perceived believability as a mediator and how the mediating effects of perceived believability are moderated by social-status seeking and cognitive fluency. Data were collected from 356 respondents using online questionnaires. The hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling and PROCESS Macro. The results suggest that the joy of missing out (JOMO) and government regulations negatively impact fake news-sharing intention. Source credibility and information quality positively impact fake news-sharing intention. Perceived believability mediates the association between antecedents and fake news-sharing intention. Mediated-moderation analysis show that social status seeking and cognitive fluency also significantly impact fake news-sharing intention. This study enriches the fake news and social media literature, and has managerial implications for marketers.}

The thematic analysis helps identify the motivators- “reason for” and barriers- “reason against” among users while using healthcare apps. Further, the output of the thematic analysis was incorporated into the questionnaire survey to get a comprehensive understanding. A total of 311 usable responses were collected through the survey for testing the hypothesized relationships. The findings suggested personal value (openness to change) and social value were associated with “reason for” and “reason against,” which further influences users' attitudes and intentions towards using healthcare apps. The findings also confirm domain-specific innovativeness moderating effect on the association between reason against & intention and attitude and intention towards using healthcare apps. The findings provide insights to policymakers and marketers that will help to increase the adoption intention of healthcare apps among users.}

A conceptual model is advanced from identity and attachment theories. Responses from 654 residents and visitors in two Swedish cities were collected through an online survey, and the conceptual model was tested across the two city samples using structural equation modelling. Findings indicate that affective place image is positively related to positive word-of-mouth and that this relationship is mediated by place attachment for both residents and visitors. The results further show that self-congruity acts as a mediator between affective place image and place attachment for visitors but not for residents.}

Accordingly, this research develops a conceptual framework and four research propositions outlining customers’ resource integration approaches towards other customers during socialisation and service exchange, as informed by their institutions endorsing either self-reliant or compliant practices. Insight is also provided into the extent to which the resource integration approaches (transpiring against the background of customers’ engagement with firms’ self-service resources) may enable other customers to participate in meaningful service exchanges in the service ecosystem. Effectively, the framework advances business understandings of the distinct roles that customers may perform when socialising other customers about self-services.}

One pre-experiment and three main experiments show that when a brand introduces a Janus fit brand extension, it is perceived to be more innovative than when it introduces either a traditional high fit extension or a low fit extension. The effects are mediated by surprise feelings. Specifically, the high brand innovativeness ratings obtained by the Janus fit extensions are explained by the fact that they elicit moderately high surprise feelings in consumers, instead of low surprise feelings (as high fit extensions) or excessively high surprise feelings (as low fit extensions). The Janus fit extensions can also be seen to evoke a “Eureka surprise experience”: an initial feeling of surprise, followed by a sudden realization that the brand extension after all makes sense for the brand in question.}

We analyze data from 257 companies. The results indicate that more market-oriented companies engage in CSR due to (a) ‘beneficence’ motivation (it’s the right moral thing) and/or (b) ‘effectiveness’ related motivations (to generate employee goodwill, customer goodwill, and/or competitive advantage). The relationships are somewhat reversed for firms that are more finance-oriented—they are more focused on (a) effectiveness motivation and/or (b) efficiency motivation (everyone else is doing it, avoiding legislation, and/or rising energy costs), but not on (c) beneficence motivation. Last, beneficence and effectiveness motivations are associated with employee morale improvements, making these valuable internal marketing tools, while efficiency motivations are associated with fiscal competitiveness improvements.}

We hypothesise that, in case of digitalized interactive platforms, the direct relationship between human psychological needs satisfaction (autonomy, relatedness and competence) and subjective well-being is mediated by customer engagement (cognitive, affective and behavioral). We applied a hybrid SEM-ANN approach to unravel the relationships. Findings show that autonomy and competence have significant relationships with all the dimensions of customer engagement (cognitive, affective and behavioral). Results also show that subjective well-being is not influenced by cognitive engagement but is influenced by affective and behavioral engagement.

Using a sample of 567 players of massively multiplayer online role-playing games in virtual reality, our study establishes conclusive evidence that player embodiment influences player purchase behaviour. Furthermore, our results reveal the presence of a mediating effect between embodiment and the purchase of virtual objects. In other words, players buy virtual objects because embodiment reinforces their commitment and their sense of belonging to their community. Clearly, this research is the first to propose this model in the field of online multiplayer games. Professionals should exploit these groundbreaking results and democratise virtual reality in games. In addition, it is important that the virtual interfaces deployed in games are more engaging, personalised and community-based.}

Based on this gap, we review the gamification-, loyalty program-, and customer engagement literature, from which we derive important insight. First, extending the customer engagement literature, we develop the concept of GLP engagement (GLPE), defined as members’ GLP-related behavior, expressed through direct- (i.e., purchase) and/or indirect (e.g., GLP-related learning/advocating) contributions, which we argue are critical to GLP effectiveness. Extending prior research, we also classify members’ indirect GLP contributions as autonomous (vs. interdependent)-, selfless (vs. self-seeking)-, control (vs. laissez-faire)-based-, collaborative (vs. competitive)-, individual (vs. generic)-, and calculated (vs. non-calculated) contributions. Second, we develop a self-determination theory-informed framework that proposes members’ intrinsic/extrinsic motivation as major drivers of GLPE, which in turn impacts customer brand engagement value (CBEV). Third, formalizing the framework’s associations, we develop a set of Propositions that serve as a springboard for further GLPE research. We conclude by discussing major implications that arise from this research.}

This paper aims to develop a conceptual framework that details how firms and customers can enhance the outcomes of firm-solicited and firm-unsolicited online customer engagement behaviors through the use of information processing systems enabled by artificial intelligence. By building on the metaphor of artificial intelligence systems as organisms and taking a Stimulus-Organism-Response theory perspective, this paper identifies different types of firm-solicited and firm-unsolicited online customer engagement behaviors that act as stimuli for artificial intelligence organisms to process customer-related information resulting in both artificial intelligence and human responses which, in turn, shape the contexts of future online customer engagement behaviors.}

Extant literature on sales enablement has been either conceptual or based on general empirical assessments. For a more nuanced understanding, we examine how sales enablement is defined and deployed in a single firm. We report the findings from a single company case study that involved 25 in-depth interviews with cross-functional respondents from sales enablement, marketing, sales operations, sales professionals, and sales managers. Our study shows that the impact of sales enablement on the organization's success is perceived as crucial; however, all stakeholders have different understandings about sales enablement. Findings indicate that different organizational hierarchy levels and functions exhibit substantially different perspectives on and understandings of sales enablement. This ambiguity may have an impact on the effective deployment of sales enablement initiatives within a firm and could result in suboptimal outcomes. We conclude with ideas for future research and provide managerial implications.}

Consequently, the present study investigates the effects of customer-perceived CSR and firm innovativeness on financial earnings, both in the short and long term. Firm actions, if meaningful, should impact customer perceptions of a firm, which affect customer satisfaction and the firm’s earnings consequently. Using panel data from service firms, our analysis indicates that perceived firm actions positively influence future earnings through customers’ overall evaluations of a firm. Furthermore, the results reveal a carryover effect of perceived actions in the long term. The present research also indicates that customers’ positive perceptions of firm actions do not directly impact financial earnings; however, they do impact earnings through customer satisfaction. This emphasizes the importance of communicating innovation, and particularly CSR activities, to customers.}

This paper proposes that firms can improve their EI performance by adopting circular economy (CE) systems and technologies, such as product take-back and recycling. We thus explore an unconventional, systems- and technology-driven path dependence dynamic leading to higher EI performance because of prior CE commitments (instead of managerial initiatives directly aimed at fostering EI). An analysis of 724 firms shows that the adoption of such technologies and systems puts firms on a sustainability path: firms benefit from making further changes to improve the functioning of these systems, which in turn create the conditions and capabilities for future EIs. Environmental supply chain policies thus mediate the relationship as the firm adopting take-back and recycling needs to involve outside partners in their administration. Neither environmental management systems nor data protection policies act as mediators. This is the first quantitative study that considers take-back and recycling and EI scores with a cross-national-cross-sectorial sample size. The results indicate that firms should see the introduction of CE systems and technologies as an opportunity for EI.}

To address these questions, we develop a conceptual framework identifying the key drivers of B2B buyer acceptance of luxury brands using sustainable materials. These drivers are categorized as brand-related, product-related, market-related, consumer-related, and country-related factors, alongside climate change risk as a key moderator. Additionally, the framework examines moderating factors, such as the price of the product, level of involvement, and other potential influences. Integrating academic research with managerial insights, this paper contributes to the growing body of literature on climate change, sustainability, and B2B marketing, offering a comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics between sustainability and luxury branding in B2B contexts.}

Using the naturalistic decision-making approach and the situative perspective on cognition and action as theoretical lenses, we identify three key characteristics of decision-making in modern marketing environments—namely, agility, inventiveness, and reflexiveness.

To make these conversations realistic, designers anthropomorphized chatbots (e.g., attributed human characteristics to chatbot) by equipping them with personality (warmth/competence), attributable gender (male/female), and role (prevention/diagnosis/therapy). Notwithstanding, scholarly inquiry has predominantly disregarded these factors when ascertaining the proclivity of individuals to utilize chatbots in healthcare. Based on human-machine interactions and counter-stereotypes theories, the aim of this research is to evaluate the conditions under which chatbot anthropomorphism can increase users' satisfaction and intention of using related services. Analyses conducted on a sample of 1147 users show that chatbots' personality does not directly influence intention of being used in healthcare. Instead, this relationship is mediated by chatbots' perceived credibility and user satisfaction, and moderated by chatbots' anthropomorphism, gender, and role. Specifically, when there is a mismatch between chatbot's gender and its stereotypical descriptive property (i.e., competence for female chatbots; warmth for male chatbots), the chatbot is more credible, satisfying, and inviting to use. Moreover, chatbots with female anthropomorphic characteristics or with a low level of anthropomorphism are better suited for prevention roles such as counseling, while chatbots with male characteristics are more appropriate for therapeutic roles.}

As product suppliers can no longer secure their competitive position through former product-related competitive advantages, more complex product offerings and integrated solutions consisting of products and services, so-called “product-service systems (PSS)”, are increasingly being offered. But how can PSS implementation and the digital servitization transformation process be successfully accomplished? This paper addresses this research question and examines the transformation process of several companies using a mixed-methods approach that includes the evaluation of objective data-based efficiency for an idealized servitization path. The study shows how important it is for companies to maintain or even strengthen former product-based competitive advantages and to build on them to develop new business areas. It also shows that companies are simultaneously implementing bi-directional product support services and customer support services. In addition, data-oriented services such as condition monitoring and remote services are proving to be the basis for offering more complex performance- and results-oriented PSS, where customers pay per unit produced rather than fixed fees. Moreover, for the first time, it can be concluded that digital services are the basis for the successful establishment of digital industrial IoT platforms.}

Results indicate that perceived control over accessed brands, intimate knowledge of these brands, and self-investment in these brands predict POLB.

abstract = {The evolution of digital platforms has transformed the way businesses operate. Digital platforms have become popular and common in Business-to-Business (B2B) markets, thereby leading to increased interest of researchers. Even with the increasing interest, the field suffers from the lack of a comprehensive approach towards plugging the gaps left behind. This review presents a synthesis of the last ten years of research on digital platforms in B2B markets. Based on Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) and Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) frameworks for adoption of innovation, the current study identifies the technological, organizational, and environmental context-based factors that play a major role in adoption of digital platforms in B2B markets. We also present a detailed overview of the research in terms of publication timeline, geographical distribution, industrial context, theory used, and methodology employed. In addition, we identify some significant gaps and set a future research agenda.}

The methodology involves the systematic content analysis of 15,000 tweets collected from three countries (UK, Italy and Spain) in April 2020. The results suggest that the top-of-mind expectation by consumers deals with escaping from home and enjoying freedom, either by having a good meal (UK), drinking alcoholic beverages (Spain), or travelling (Italy). They also suggest that the high levels of risk individuals were exposed to during the pandemic will not influence behavior in the long-term post-lockdown. Instead, they suggest consumers are willing to restore their consumption levels especially of activities that contribute to the sense of escapism. Finally, results provide evidence of the cultural differences emerging from consumers from different countries during the pandemic. Implications for international marketers and retailers are provided.}

Our study is grounded in values theory and we present arguments for Schwartz’s values of power, universalism, and openness to change as systematic predictors of anger and hope in a third-party conflict. We examine our conceptual framework among Croatian consumers evaluating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and find that power value systematically predicts anger toward Palestine, whereas universalism predicts anger toward Israel. Universalism is also found to be significantly associated with hope. The openness to change value is only related to hope. Consistent with expectations, we find significant effects between anger/hope and consumers’ buying intentions. Vicarious animosity has important theoretical implications for our understanding of consumer animosity and managerial implications for the managers of brands from countries involved in geopolitical conflicts.}

Determinant attributes are typically identified using direct methods or indirect methods. However, the voice of the customer online can also provide key insights regarding attributes that are part of the consumers’ pre-purchase search process. The purpose of this study is to propose a framework to identify determinant attributes from online consumer questions. Our method uses semi-supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify product attributes initially. This is followed by the application of sequence pattern mining to identify temporal sequences of determinant attributes. Finally, hierarchical time series is used to forecast consumer interest in determinant attributes over time. The results show that our study can be used to identify determinant attributes of competing brands and can also be used to forecast consumer interest in these attributes. Brands can use this framework to have a pulse on what consumers look for before purchase. This will aid their decisions related to promotion as well as product development processes.}

In this article, we describe the roots of influencer marketing and the many different types of influencers that now exist. We identify influencers’ three functional components: the audience, the endorser, and the social media manager. We then detail for each of these components the different sources of value influencers potentially offer marketers. We draw on relevant academic research to offer advice about how to leverage each component strategically. We close by describing how the interplay of these functional components makes influencers a potentially powerful—and undervalued—marketing tool.}

We also examine the roles of the key factors that determine a brand extension’s success. Our findings illustrate that the first two factors have both direct and indirect effects, and the last one has indirect effects on the customer’s repurchase intentions. Moreover, for highly inertial customers, the fit of the parent brand with the extension has less of an impact on customers’ perception of quality regarding the extended brand. This research advances our understanding of how customers interact in peer-to-peer sharing contexts and provides insights into the marketing strategies needed on these platforms.}

Using the trait-based concept of shopping orientation, we provide an additional antecedent to variety-seeking by looking at the phenomenon as it relates to the mindsets consumers adopt surrounding the process of shopping. Across three studies, we show that the more a consumer sees shopping as an enjoyable activity, the more likely they are to seek variety. We show this effect to occur regardless of whether choices are made sequentially, or as one bundle, as well as the roles that information-seeking and deal-proneness tendencies play. By providing this account of variety-seeking behavior we provide a significant addition to current knowledge as well as implications for firms seeking to manage the levels of variety sought by consumers.}

Drawing on brand equity logic, the study proposes that perceived positive brand attributes, awareness, attitudes, and loyalty toward the parent brand positively relate to higher perceived value of the brand extension, and that these positive relationships grow stronger in cases of step-down extensions rather than step-up extensions. Survey results from UK hotel customers reveal that only perceived parent brand attributes and attitudes seem to have a positive impact on perceived value of the extension and subsequent (re)visit intentions. The moderation results further reveal that the positive relationships turn stronger in cases of step-down extensions and insignificant during step-up extensions. Managers are therefore cautioned to apply step-up extensions too frivolously, as such extensions seem largely ineffective in generating consumer value and subsequent behavioral intentions, whereas the effectiveness is heightened in cases of step-down extensions.}

Based on the premise that differing actors tend to have different goals/interests, as advanced in stakeholder theory, we deduce that positive/negative CE can yield differing perceived value-based effects across actors. To address this issue, we examine the particular case of positive/negative CE’s value-creating/eroding effects as perceived by the actors of fellow customers and the firm, which we classify in a multi-actor typological framework.

abstract = {Industrial and service firms alike are increasingly adopting digital servitization to achieve service-driven growth and establish a competitive advantage. Firms must develop sufficient capabilities to benefit from digital servitization, which is an underinvestigated topic in the literature. This study contributes to bridging this gap by taking a service-dominant logic (SDL) perspective and focusing on value co-creation capabilities in B2B firms that offer digital service platforms and services based on them. It draws on a multiple-case study design involving leading cases from sectors such as manufacturing, engineering and shipping. The findings identify a set of four value co-creation capabilities: digital literacy, aligning, reflecting and coping. Moreover, this study highlights how these capabilities can facilitate value co-creation in the context of digital servitization initiatives. For managers, the findings provide insights into what characterizes value co-creation capabilities in digital servitization and why, how and when these capabilities are relevant.}

In most cases, they only have a few initial years’ data to predict T*. Although product managers manage to predict T*, there is no method to date that can predict T* accurately. In this paper, we develop a new metric based on the diffusion modeling framework that can help in assessing the prediction accuracy of T*. This metric is built on the premise that observed sales growth is affected both by the force that systematically varies with time and by the non-systematic random forces. We show that the two forces must be carefully combined to assess if a predicted T* is accurate enough. In addition, we empirically prove the efficacy of the proposed metric.}

We further examine the direct and indirect effects of consumer impulsiveness on the use of multiple shopping applications for online purchases. Data collected from 275 mobile shopping application (app) users through an online survey were analyzed using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Results confirm the significant impact of mobility, personalization, product assortment, and hedonic motivation on impulsiveness, except the app's visual appeal. Impulsiveness was found to be strongly correlated with users' intention to install another shopping app, whereas consumers behavioral intention was a significant precursor of their multiple app usage behavior. The findings apprise managers of the role of impulsiveness in encouraging split loyalty among mobile shoppers and prescribe new strategies for sustained use of shopping platforms.}

Nevertheless, research on the dark side of brand attachment is scant. This study investigates the effect of brand attachment on two negative behaviors (compulsive buying and trash talking). The survey findings show that the three components of brand attachment - passion, prominence, and anxiety - are positively related to impulsive and obsessive–compulsive buying. In turn, consumers who exhibit obsessive–compulsive buying are more likely to practice trash talking. Furthermore, consumer age moderates the relationship between brand passion, brand anxiety and compulsive buying. The research adds to the body of knowledge of consumer-brand relationship, particularly on the dark side of brand attachment. The findings contribute to the creation and deployment of altruistic customer relationship programs and regulations.}

To address this gap, this study employs a multiple case study approach to uncover the varied processes and outcomes of implementing digital diversification programs in established firms. The findings reveal that established firms frequently refine and adjust their digital diversification strategies to achieve desired results. Specifically, related digital diversification strategies benefit from well-defined market segments, clear technological focus, and robust senior management support. In contrast, unrelated digital diversification strategies thrive through extensive exploration and experimentation with novel digital technologies and markets, reduced senior managerial intervention and increased middle- and lower-level management involvement. Semi-related digital diversification strategies, which incorporate elements of both related and unrelated approaches, often encounter tensions owing to conflicting traditional and new program execution methods, posing significant realization challenges. Key factors identified as instrumental in the success of digital diversification strategies include technology, markets, management & organization, and program execution. The study concludes by discussing the managerial and academic implications and offers recommendations for future research in this domain.}

Societies benefit not only from new products and services, but also from new jobs, as created through innovating firms. Thus, innovation success potentially leads to increased societal wealth. However, the question arises: What factors help companies to become successful innovators? Research shows that networking activities between firms and their stakeholders have an important impact on innovation success. This is particularly true for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that often lack crucial resources that enable them to innovate. However, a few existing studies do not support the finding that networking leads to increased innovation outputs. So, we must ask: Under which circumstances do networking activities enable SMEs to become successful innovators? In this study, we analyze a sample of 451 SMEs and, using fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), find that the question is not whether to network or not. Rather, both high- and low-intensity networking firms can use different combinations of underlying strategic orientations and resource-leveraging capabilities to enable innovation success.}

Second, the analysis of interviews from various B2B firms adds depth with regard to the contingencies of effective calculator use.

Specifically, this research addresses two main questions: 1) how do shopping basket metrics (mean and median number of items, the distribution of one, two, three … n items) differ by retail type, and 2) how does the Pareto ratio (sales generated by the heaviest 20%, and lightest 80% of buyers) apply to shopping baskets. The results show that basket size patterns in retailers are predictable. Shoppers purchase more items on average in retailers that offer a greater variety of items, and the distribution of basket sizes follows the Poisson lognormal model. The results also show that the largest 20% of shopping baskets on average generate 50% of unit sales, and 40% of dollar revenue. These results set additional benchmarks of the patterns that can be expected when looking at data on a basket-level. This research offers implications to practitioners by showing the importance of small and large baskets for retailer revenue and growth, which can guide more informed decision making to better manage their stores and brands.}

However, despite the sometimes considerable investments at stake and the possibly very negative effects of unrealized solutions, marketing research has not investigated them yet. This study thus conceptualizes unrealized solutions in business markets and, in a qualitative study with 25 representatives of solution customer and supplier firms, identifies the drivers of their occurrence and the forms they may take. Moreover, the study derives measures from these findings that providers can take to avoid and reimplement unrealized solutions or learn from them to develop future offerings.}

However, little attention has been given to how the individual influencers' use of multiple social networking sites affects their followers' behavioral intentions. Hence, this academic gap warrants further exploration. Drawing on cue consistency theory, social identity theory, and stimulus-organism-response framework, this research proposes three research questions and constructs an integrated research model to explore how the influencers' cue consistency affects the social identification of their followers, subsequently influencing their behavioral intentions. A structural equation modeling technique is performed to analyze the data of 510 valid respondents. The findings show that influencers' consistent cues (i.e., information and image consistency) across social media have positive impacts on followers' cognitive and affective identification toward the influencers. Furthermore, the determinants for followers' purchase intention and electronic word-of-mouth intention are affirmed to serve as both cognitive and affective identification. Especially, the results indicate that the relationships between followers’ social identifications and behavioral intentions are moderated by the type of influencer (i.e., lifestyle vs. review). Accordingly, the results indicate how the use of multiple social networking sites by influencers impacts the behavioral intentions of their followers. The findings offer new insights into influencer marketing and provide important lessons for marketers.}

Access-providing private business schools face competing challenges of balancing inclusiveness and access with excellence and quality. Pursuing inclusiveness and access alongside excellence and quality seems a utopian ideal. However, this study propounds transformative quality as key for addressing these conflicting issues, which have long impacted post-massification and continue to have a grave effect post-pandemic.

We validated the proposed scale through three studies exploring the perspectives of front-line faculty members representing 25 business schools from 10 major cities in India. The study results indicate that TRFQ comprises five dimensions such as critical confidence, problem-solving skills for approach-avoidance, overall awareness, overcoming prejudices and skillfulness.

This study aims at understanding how the dialogic communication potential of four African destinations' place websites relates to destination image from the perspective of potential visitors/tourists. The study employed a quantitative research approach for data collection and analyses. Specifically, data was analysed using the structural equation modelling approach. The dialogic communication principles of a website serve as an antecedent to forming customer perceptions about a destination. The destination image impression of a country positively relates to visiting intentions; an indication that perceived destination image is another antecedent of visiting intentions. Place websites have surprisingly not adequately featured in academic and practitioner interrogation with respect to brand marketing and communications and this paper is one of the attempts to address this research lacuna. Significant implications for researchers and managers promoting destinations have been highlighted.}

The purpose of this research is to examine the effects of Covid-19 phobia, and news exposure on individuals’ psychological states, and their resulting mobile shopping behaviour. Relying upon the Activate, Belief and Consequences (ABC) model of the Cognitive-Behaviour Theory, this research applies the partial least square structural modelling (PLS-SEM) methodology for analysing the data from 302 mobile shoppers from India. The results confirm that Covid-19 phobia and Covid-19 news exposure are substantial determinants of consumers’ smartphone addictive use and pessimism, which in turn affect mobile shopping frequency. Additionally, social influence is found to play a vital role in moderating mobile shopping frequency for individuals, who experience smartphone addiction. The current study is a pioneering effort to examine the influence of Covid-19-induced phobia on consumers' psychological states and their subsequent impact on their mobile shopping frequency. The study provides several contributions to theory and practice within the areas of technology use and mobile shopping in particular.}

This study introduces a novel synthesis of Signaling theory and Stewardship theory and examines the moderating impact of brand governance on the relationship between green brand identity, consistent communication and channel partner commitment, leading to tactical green marketing orientation. Distinguishing itself from previous research, our approach embraces a multi-perspective lens, delving into the viewpoints of both channel partners and organizations (i.e., managers). Employing an explanatory sequential mixed method design, the first phase involved an empirical survey with 248 respondents (Study 1). Subsequently, the second phase (Study 2) comprised qualitative interviews with 41 respondents. The findings from both studies converged, revealing a positive association between “consistent communication” and “attitude,” a robust connection between “attitude” and “commitment,” and a favorable correlation between “green brand identity” and “attitude,” ultimately leading to a positive relationship between “attitude” and “green tactical marketing orientation". This research significantly contributes to the comprehension of B2B green brand positioning by demonstrating, that in the B2B context, brand governance influences channel partners' commitment and tactical green marketing orientation.}

However, since the conversion rate of distributed coupons into coupons redeemed for purchase is relatively low, there is a need to understand the redemption decisions of consumers. Lower conversion rates lead businesses to lose both customers and profits. Previous studies have typically focused on social couponing from a business perspective, without exploring factors from the customer's end. The current study explores the factors influencing customers' decision to redeem coupons and highlights the interrelationships between the factors. Data were collected from 353 online customers on their redemption experiences during their food purchases. Structural equation modeling was performed to examine the significance of the factors and establish the predictability of customers' redemption decisions. We then explored different machine learners to identify the best-fitting models for customers' redemption decisions. Results showed that the prediction accuracy of the decision-tree-based models was the highest. These models delineate the role of influencers in various redemption aspects and validate the mediation effects of perceived risk, deal proneness, referral, and consumption frequency. The study also highlights future research areas in the social couponing domain.}

First, we aim to systematically investigate the relationship between strategic alliance formations and firm shareholder value, identifying conditions under which strategic alliances create or even destroy value, including factors related to the firms and alliances as well as their interactions. Our second objective is to explain how B2B marketing researchers can apply the event study methodology in the context of strategic alliances. We provide a detailed explanation of how scholars can apply an event study methodology to strategic alliances, and B2B relationships more broadly, taking into account the research area-specific considerations, such as the appropriate modeling approach, variable coding, and event and estimation windows.}

The partial least squares (PLS) technique was used to validate the dimensions of affordance actualisation and its relationship with e-textbooks engagement and affordance effect. The findings indicate the efficacy of the two affordance constructs, as well as the significant mediating effect of engagement. An important lesson for the e-textbook industry is that firms need to consider affordance actualisation dimensions (i.e., portability, accessibility, searchability, highlighting, copying, browsing, hedonic and utilitarian value) when enhancing digital engagement and use of e-textbooks.}

Our study examines how these processes impact pioneering orientation, firms' emphasis on launching innovative products ahead of competitors, in business-to-business (B2B) small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The prevailing view is firms should simultaneously pursue both processes or focus on just one. We challenge this notion and posit B2B SMEs should generally prioritise one process over the other to effectively shape pioneering orientation. However, certain circumstances like upstream supply chain (SC) integration and strong information technology (IT) competence enable firms to optimise benefits by alternating between processes. Our longitudinal analysis of 213 Chinese B2B SMEs supports this argument, revealing marketing exploration has a stronger positive influence on pioneering orientation than exploitation. Furthermore, our analysis shows upstream SC integration alone does not moderate, but combined with robust IT competence, can increase the advantages of marketing exploitation over exploration when fostering pioneering orientation in B2B SMEs.}

The artificial intelligence (AI)-powered digital technologies applications continue to emerge to enhance and improve novel ways of communication on social media platforms, particularly Instagram. Indeed, this has caused a change in the behavioral and social customer journey, where customers need to embrace a digital experience adoption. The AI applications primarily aim to study the shoppers browsing trend to draw new clients and expand businesses. Even the fashion industry has tapped into Instagram's business benefits in this fast-paced and competitive industry. With this quick and compelling way to capture shoppers’ attention towards fashion products, the purchase decision may differ between e-shoppers and conventional shoppers. AI seems to be extremely promising and has the potential to be a game changer for Instagram users, advertisers, and influencers. This study applies the Engel-Kollat-Blackwell (EKB) theory to investigate the effects of AI-based digital technology experiences on Instagrammers’ fashion apparel purchase decisions - perceived eWOM, perceived emotional value, perceived quality, perceived risk and perceived price. Based on data collected from Instagram users, the framework of this study was evaluated using structural equation modelling (SEM). Semi-structured in-depth interviews were also conducted as part of the research to get a more in-depth understanding of the profiles and behaviors of Instagram users. Our findings from both methodologies confirm that perceived emotional value, perceived quality, and perceived eWOM revealed a statistically significant and positive influence on Instagrammers’ purchase decisions for fashion apparel. Meanwhile, the importance performance matrix analysis (IPMA) identified perceived emotional value as the most important factor for Instagrammers, but the highest performance was perceived quality. This research has important implications for Malaysian online retailers and shoppers to adapt to the fast-changing digital transformation. Assuredly, this study makes a noteworthy contribution to attitudinal research on social media commerce within the fashion industry.}

Recently, some retailers have offered promotions that pair a strong brand with a weak brand, with the goal of helping the weak brand. What is unique about these promotions is that the strength of the alliance integration is very low. The present research was designed to address the question of whether such asymmetric brand alliances—bundling a weak brand with a strong brand as part of a joint sales promotion—can benefit the weak brand through a transfer of positive associations from the strong brand. We show that not only do such partnerships fail to help the weak brand, they can actually hurt the weak brand by increasing the salience of the brand contrast in consumers’ decision-making process. We also show that alliance integration moderates the transference of the association’s effect.}

To assess the same, empirical data is used. Four hundred sixty-six respondents from India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the USA, and few other countries are considered. The structural model is tested with the help of both approaches. Findings indicate that the item loadings are usually higher in PLS-SEM than CB-SEM. The structural relationship is closer to CB-SEM if a consistent PLS algorithm is undertaken in PLS-SEM. It is also found that average variance extracted (AVE) and composite reliability (CR) values are higher in the PLS-SEM method, indicating better construct reliability and validity. CB-SEM is better in providing model fit indices, whereas PLS-SEM fit indices are still evolving. CB-SEM models are better for factor-based models like ours, whereas composite-based models provide excellent outcomes in PLS-SEM. This study contributes to the existing literature significantly by providing an empirical comparison of all the three methods for predictive research domains.

Hedge ratio results show that GO-GARCH has the highest hedging effectiveness for hedging green bonds with shale gas and natural gas. Natural gas appears to be the best hedge for green bond prices, according to estimates of hedging effectiveness. We find no significant Granger causality between green bonds and natural gas in the short- and long-term dynamics of the spectral Granger causality test, but we do find long-term Granger causality between green bonds and shale gas. We find strong significant bidirectional causal effects between green bonds and gas prices during bearish market conditions using the time-varying causality test. The evidence of a strong correlation between green bonds and shale gas and natural gas suggests that policymakers should consider both markets as interconnected in their policy formulation strategy. Furthermore, increasing the share of green bonds will undeniably support the transition to a low-carbon economy, fulfilling the promise of the Paris climate change agreement. Realizing the role of green bonds as diversifiers against the fluctuation of gas markets encourages portfolio investors who want to achieve higher investment performance to include green bonds in their portfolios.}

abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of price-related factors on consumer choices within the Chinese luxury watch market. It explores how the positive prestige effect and negative substitution effect contribute to consumer preferences for luxury watches. Notably, heterogeneity in the prestige effect is observed at both the consumer and brand levels. Consumer-level analysis reveals a U-shaped relationship between family income and prestige sensitivity, emphasizing heightened sensitivity among lower and higher-end middle-income consumers. Top-tier luxury watch brands demonstrate a more pronounced prestige effect compared to lower-tier counterparts at the brand level. What-if simulations underscore the advantages of brand promotion and enhanced prestige, especially for top-tier brands. Income escalation benefits top-tier luxury watch brands, while its impact on lower-tier brands is intricate. These findings offer strategic insights for marketers to refine their approaches and harness the power of the prestige effect.}

With the analysis of structural equation modelling, we confirmed the three-dimensional SMO and its contribution to start-ups' profitability. Moreover, we proved that attitudes are marginal, whereas subjective norm and perceived behavioural control are a very strong predictor of SMO. Finally, by using the cluster analysis, we revealed that B2B start-ups have lower levels of strategic integration, societal engagement, and ethical capabilities, as opposed to B2C start-ups.}

Using a time-lagged two-wave survey of 227 manufacturing SMEs, we tested our proposed hypotheses using structural equational modeling (SEM). Our results reveal that digital platform capability is positively associated with the agility of SMEs and that all three intellectual capital dimensions (i.e., human, organizational, and relational capital) mediate this relationship. We also found that environmental dynamism has a negative moderating role on digital platform capability and intellectual capital. Environmental dynamism curbs SMEs’ abilities to turn their digital platform capabilities into increased intellectual capital. Our results shed light on the importance of intellectual capital in creating improved organizational agility for manufacturing SMEs through digital platform capability within the boundary conditions of environmental dynamism.}

We conducted two online experiments to explore whether leaving an incentivized false positive review (vs. incentivized genuine positive review) leads customers to feel guilty, impacting their satisfaction with the brand.

CEX with standard P2P offerings focuses on the utilitarian aspects of the physical internal and external environment and human interaction, which, in the premium P2P context, foster aesthetic, symbolic, and emotional experiences. Overall, CEX with premium P2P is rich in symbolism, aesthetically pleasing, emotionally charged, and is likely to lead to customer delight.

Individuals with experience of service failure within the Iranian hotel industry context were surveyed, with findings identifying four discrete consumer segments underpinned by varied combinations of active, expressive, and denial-based post-failure coping behaviours. Each distinct segment activated different rumination behaviours. Further, logit models demonstrate that three eWOM archetypes are driven by different predictors, suggesting that consumers’ online behaviours following service failure are heterogeneous and shaped by the coping strategy employed.}

We uncover the connectedness between the traditional cultural practices of arranged marriages and the space of shaadi.com, a matrimonial website.

In the post COVID-19 era where finance will be likely to become more difficult for small firms to access, crowdfunding has the potential to be an even more important part of entrepreneurial funding, and enable firms previously denied opportunities the chance to grow. This makes understanding crowdfunding important from a social as well as financial perspective. The paper explores how crowdfunding enables value co-creation. It does so by analysing interview data with start-ups who raised money through crowdfunding and then compares these findings with the views of traditional funders. The findings from the study highlight the speed of raising finance and the avoidance of financial monitoring controls as key sources of value co-creation, along with the increased negotiating power with traditional funders and retail partners that comes from achieving validation, i.e., providing evidence that there is demand for the start-up's products. The validation enables the entrepreneur to increase value capture from their interactions with further funders and business partners. The temporal dimension is crucial as a successful crowdfund can shift power towards the crowdfunded firm and away from other participants.}

Drawing on endogenous growth theory and extending the Gorodnichenko and Schnitzer (2013) framework, we hypothesize that in addition to firm-specific factors, country-level variables manifested within FC hamper incremental innovation, albeit in varying degrees due to industry heterogeneity. Secondly, as opposed to previous studies that solely focus on FC affecting firm innovation, we propose that due to resource constraints, firms in transition economies tend to follow an imitational innovation strategy, and therefore, from this perspective, IPR protection can be crucial for firm-level innovation within those economies. Using data from the World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) consisting of information for about 21,960 firms from 27 Eastern European and Central Asian transition countries and employing a two-step probit model with endogenous regressors, we find that adverse effects of FC and IPR on firms' innovation activities are driven from within as well as between industries. Focusing on the differential impacts of FC and IPR protection across industries, we direct potential causal pathways from easing FC and optimal IPR protection to encourage firms' innovation. Based on the findings, while very strict IPR protection is detrimental to firms' product and process innovation in industries with limited resource and skill capabilities, it is nevertheless helpful for research and development (R&D) activities in industries characterised by strong R&D and IP capacities. Our results offer useful insights for policymakers to support incremental innovation as well as boost invention. IPR protection policies require to be customised to the industries and firms, since invariably tight or lax IPR enforcement can be discouraging to both incremental and radical innovation, causing all industries suffering from the same treatment.}

Two experiments compare the perceived humanness and adoption scores for (a) an error-free chatbot, (b) a chatbot seeking clarification regarding a consumer input and (c) a chatbot which fails to discern context. The results suggest that unresolved errors are sufficient to reduce anthropomorphism and adoption intent. However, there is no perceptual difference between an error-free chatbot and one which seeks clarification. The ability to resolve miscommunication (clarification) appears as effective as avoiding it (error-free). Furthermore, the higher a consumer’s need for human interaction, the stronger the anthropomorphism - adoption relationship. Thus, anthropomorphic chatbots may satisfy the social desires of consumers high in need for human interaction.}

Although recent literature considers service ecosystem dynamics, little research concurrently addresses two key drivers of it: emergence and phase transitions. These two phenomena are often confused and frequently co-exist, with phase transitions necessarily involving emergence. Drawing on meta-theoretical foundations of service-dominant logic and systems theory, this conceptual paper synthesizes and extends knowledge of emergence and phase transitions in service ecosystems, including proposed new definitions. To achieve these aims, first the conditions where phase transitions and emergence exist or co-exist are identified, and second, key features, triggers, processes and outcomes are compared and contrasted. A conceptual framework illustrates how emergence and phase transition, together and separately, impact service ecosystem dynamics. In addition to the theoretical contribution, our work can assist managers discern, navigate and harness these phenomena by adopting non-predictive approaches such as effectuation and environmental scanning. Promising future research topics are also proposed.}

Therefore, after the pandemic, the platform model has become a trend for transformation among fitness clubs to resist risks of uncertainty and expand the market for course sales. The cooperation between well-known coaches and online fitness platforms to achieve optimal pricing has gained attention in the process of transformation of fitness clubs from offline to online platforms. The platform model of fitness clubs can help online fitness platforms expand the dissemination of well-known coaches' courses and enhance the spillover effect of course popularity. We construct pricing decision models for both clubs and coaches by characterizing the consumer utility function of well-known coaches and online fitness platforms, the demand function for fitness courses in the market, and the revenue functions for clubs and coaches. We use the Shanghai Zhongtian Fitness Club in China as a case study to analyze pricing decision solutions and perform numerical experiments and sensitivity analyses on online course sales data obtained during the lockdown periods. The study found that the optimal prices for well-known coaches' courses and online fitness platforms increase with market size, indicating their ability to increase fitness course prices among potential consumers. Further, the profit level increases with market size, indicating that market expansion brings in more potential consumers and the profits gained by well-known coaches’ courses and online fitness platforms from potential consumers exceed the profits lost due to price increases; this results in an overall increase in profit level. We further conclude that online fitness platforms can use the platform pricing model of fitness clubs to transform and upgrade.}

Using the ripple effects and bullwhip effects literature as its underlying theoretical foundation, this paper uses longitudinal data from the apparel industry to analyze the advertising differences among the major suppliers of a supply chain (SC) system holistically using a bilinear mixed model. The results support the presence of the ripple effect of advertising and suggest that advertising should be better coordinated across supply chain members to reduce operational and financial inefficiencies.}

The present study discusses the central and peripheral sources of influence, such as the content of the review, star rating, review length, and the total number of votes on the perceived usefulness of the review. It analyses reviews from Amazon.com on three products, namely, a videogame, digital music, and a grocery item. Using text mining, the study uncovers sentiment polarity, identifies sentiment patterns, and finally, analyses the perceived usefulness of reviews under the moderation effect. The study establishes that the impact of the central route is not significant for search goods. The study concludes that peripheral sources have a significant impact on the search products. Our study provides insights on how marketing strategies can be formulated by online retailers based on the product type.}

Contemporary discussions consider MNEs as differentiated network with self-initiated subsidiaries. However, while moving away from pure hierarchy, internalization theory has not fully particularized the coordinating mechanism across MNEs’ networked subsidiaries. Accordingly, we propose a novel role of subsidiaries’ reputation within their MNEs. Based on primary data from subsidiaries’ perspective, our findings are threefold. First, we demonstrate that a subsidiary’s reputation within the MNE is a critical driver for subsidiary-specific advantages. Second, we examine how subsidiaries’ strategic actions can send signals to their headquarters and sister subsidiaries to build its reputation. Finally, along with the reputation-building process, we reveal the contingencies of subsidiaries’ autonomy and resources within the MNE. Our results show that internalization enables a differentiated network mechanism constituted by reputation, autonomy control, and resource allocation across MNEs’ networked subsidiaries.}

The result shows a negative dependence structure for the return series between AI and carbon prices. However, the relationship is asymmetric, indicating that there is a stronger tail dependence in the lower tails instead of the upper tails. The finding implies that AI is a favourable hedge against carbon prices, therefore indicating the diversification benefits of AI. To understand the issue in detail, we examine the effect of economic policy uncertainty, equity market volatility, and the recent COVID-19 pandemic; we find their negative effect on the dynamic dependence structure between AI and carbon prices at lower and higher quantiles. This evidence offers additional support for the safe-haven ability of AI for carbon prices.}

This study of senior managers uses qualitative data to understand the mechanisms adopted by top management to make the switch to SBMIs. Data was gathered from 285 middle managers to empirically validate the theoretical model. The study concludes that in the top management team (TMT), ambidextrous learning has a positive association with the firm's decision to adopt SBMIs. However, TMT diversity and university-industry collaboration are positively associated with ambidextrous learning by top management and, subsequently, the adoption of SBMIs. Our findings also suggest that transformational leadership positively moderates the association between TMT diversity and ambidextrous learning.

Such a phenomenon has led us to explore how price image and sugrophobia, a psychological feeling of being taken advantage of, would influence consumers' future behavioural intention in the context of luxury retail store. Informed by a survey of 400 consumers, this study adopts the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S–O-R) model to examine how price image triggers consumer perceptions (i.e., perceived value, trust and attitude) and results in behavioral intention. Sugrophobia is included in the S–O-R model to assess its moderating effect. Data analysis using SEM-PLS demonstrates that a retailer's price image has a positive effect on consumers' perceived value, trust, attitude, and future behavioral intention. Sugrophobia, in turn, is found to weaken the relationship between price image and consumer perceptions. The study thus highlights the relevance of sugrophobia among risk-averse consumers and the necessity to manage sugrophobic consumers effectively in the context of a luxury retail store. Implications of the study are discussed.}

The study here describes SOSDE in poultry products manufacturing but the propositions advanced are applicable across a wide span of industries. This study contributes by integrating prior organizational mental models, production economics, industrial marketing, and systems engineering principles in empirical applications.

The results show that OBCE has a direct as well as indirect effect on repurchase intention through the mediation of consumer forgiveness. In contrast, brand super-recovery effort has a weak direct effect on repurchase intention, and its effect is mainly indirect through consumer forgiveness. The findings suggest that higher levels of consumer brand engagement and forgiveness can offset the negative consequences of brand scandals, highlighting the importance of fostering customer engagement in the brand’s online communities.

In particular, consumers with a low to average need for belonging are less willing to purchase counterfeits when they hold unfavorable moral beliefs towards counterfeits but are more willing when they hold favorable moral beliefs. The results suggest that need for belonging levels influences a consumer's willingness to purchase counterfeit products.

Despite this progress, understanding of the evolution of AI advertising research remains limited, and a state-of-the-art overview is required to advance future research. To address this gap, this review aims to map the field's evolution by conducting a bibliometric and framework-based analysis of 75 AI advertising articles published between 1990 and 2022. The study's key findings are the publication trends in AI advertising, TCCM classification, and research contexts identified through bibliographic coupling. Four themes emerged as key focus areas of AI advertising research: programmatic advertising and automation, ad planning and engagement, advertising effectiveness, and trust in AI advertising. In addition, this review offers practical guidelines and future research directions for developing AI advertising literature. Lastly, the review suggests broader implications for industry and academia, highlighting how the identified themes can inform advertising practice and contribute to the theoretical development of the field.}

Service firms aspire to achieve a distinctive vision through service transformation, often engaging technology and digitalization as critical partners in creating long-term firm success in the market by nurturing enhanced customer and stakeholder benefits. Therefore, it is imperative for us to examine, understand, and seek ways in which transformation can be utilized effectively by service firms. A new conceptualization is proposed that highlights how service transformation can follow many strategic paths, ranging from a relatively minor linear evolutionary reformation of service offerings to a cyclical and ongoing complete creative destruction and reincarnation of the firm. This manuscript first proposes an organizing framework to understand the internal and external factors that have the potential to render service transformation achievable, as well as the range of internal and external outcomes that can result from successful transformation. We then draw upon theories of evolution to delineate the process of transformation over time in service contexts, resulting in a conceptual model of service transformation that articulates three viable pathways to service transformation, which we call the “3Rs of Service Transformation” – reformation, renovation, and reincarnation. We define and provide examples of these three paths of service transformation and identify situations and contexts in which each approach may be most appropriate for certain firms. We conclude with a discussion of future research directions.}

Our study explores these criticisms by systematically comparing NPS with six alternative calculation methods based on the LTR question (including alternative NPS calculations, LTR ‘top-box’, and average metrics) using 193,220 responses for seven sportswear brands. The study establishes that while NPS performs well in a comparative assessment of calculation methods, ‘top-box’ metrics perform better, undermining claims that NPS is the one number managers need to grow.

This study investigates how users' post-adoption behavior in using delivery robots is formed. Based on the task-technology fit (TTF) model, we present a research model that includes both direct and indirect factors that have been previously overlooked in the literature. We collected data from 550 users of delivery robots. Our structural equation modelling results show that two hedonic- (i.e., gratification and anthropomorphism) and three utilitarian- (i.e., service quality experience, delivery task requirements, and user-facing technology performance) driven factors predict perceived TTF in using delivery robots. Value-in-use and trust have sequential mediating effects that connect perceived TTF and service reuse likelihood and word-of-mouth recommendation. Our findings suggest ways to improve last-mile delivery robot strategies and provide practical implications for the industry.}

In this paper, we take a step back to better understand the state of LO research, including its relationship with strategic orientations. As a part of this synthesis, we offer several criticisms of the LO literature that hinders its conceptual development as an initiator of capability enhancement, innovation, and performance. A key assertion is that LO is not a strategic orientation per se because it influences the quality of informational inputs into strategic planning, not their focus. That is, LO does not direct firms towards a particular strategic approach as do strategic orientations. Instead, as a dynamic capability it motivates firms to monitor and improve the quality of information used to operationalize all strategic orientations. As such, it improves the efficacy of whichever strategic orientation(s) firms choose to adopt.}

Prior research has focused on intentions as a predictor of actual behaviour. This study directly compares two distinct predictors of behaviour, behavioural expectation (BE) and behavioural intention (BI), to explain whether differences in the way in which consumers’ mental judgments are measured act as a barrier to understanding pro-environmental behaviour change. Findings confirm that BE has a higher temporal stability than BI, potentially accounting for the greater predictive ability of the former. One key reason for this finding is that subjects may overestimate their likelihood to act when responding to BI questions. Thus, this paper confirms that BE has a higher temporal stability than BI, and therefore, superior predictive ability. TRA/TPB researchers in particular should consider BE ahead of BI as an immediate predictor of pro-environmental and other behaviours.}

abstract = {Tactical sales forecasting is fundamental to production, transportation and personnel decisions at all levels of a supply chain. Traditional forecasting methods extrapolate historical sales information to predict future sales. As a result, these methods are not capable of anticipating macroeconomic changes in the business environment that often have a significant impact on the demand. To account for these macroeconomic changes, companies adjust either their statistical forecast manually or rely on an expert forecast. However, both approaches are notoriously biased and expensive. This paper investigates the use of leading macroeconomic indicators in the tactical sales forecasting process. A forecasting framework is established that automatically selects the relevant variables and predicts future sales. Next, the seasonal component is predicted by the seasonal naive method and the long-term trend using a LASSO regression method with macroeconomic indicators, while keeping the size of the indicator’s set as small as possible. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed framework is evaluated by quantifying the impact of each individual component. The carried out analysis has shown that the proposed framework achieves a reduction of 54.5% in mean absolute percentage error when compared to the naive forecasting method. Moreover, compared to the best performing conventional methods, a reduction of 25.6% is achieved in the tactical time window over three different real-life case studies from different geographical areas.}

We also observe that while interaction with cultural intelligence strengthens the relationship of expressing emotional states with mutual trust, awareness of cultural intelligence weakens it. In addition, awareness of cultural intelligence positively moderates the link between evoking emotional states and mutual trust but negatively conditions the link between expressing emotional states and mutual trust. These findings highlight the importance of emotions as organizational capabilities that can help create an exchange environment characterized by open communication and confidence that partners will meet agreed-on obligations.}

A framework-based review using Theory, Context, Characteristics, and Methods (TCCM) typology with an integrated analysis of 88 research articles published between 2000 and 2020 was carried out. It was found that visual merchandising as a product-driven display function has been closely related to store atmosphere as a store-wide display function. Hence an integrated framework of research in visual merchandising and store atmospherics becomes imperative to understand their interplay in the evolving scope of traditional and e-tailers' environments. The paper contributes as the first and most comprehensive review of research on visual merchandising with the closely substitutable domain- store atmospherics.}

The impact of the type of data on perceptions of distributive justice changes as a function of the type of incentive provided to customers (Study 1) and the level of effort required to see the personalized price (Study 2).

Our approach was longitudinal capturing virtual team activities from start to end of each project, and involved multiple data collection methods, including observations and interviews. The findings reveal that the virtual team lifespan influences the type of temporal coordination that emerges. In virtual teams with short lifespans, tight coordination with frequent communication can help to reduce the uncertainty characterizing the fuzzy front-end. On the other hand, in virtual teams with longer lifespans, loose coordination allows dispersed members to work simultaneously on different, complementary aspects of the task at hand. These findings extend scholarly understanding around how innovation activities are coordinated in technology-mediated environments, such as virtual teams. Finally, we discuss theoretical and managerial implications.}

While this form of artificial intelligence offers numerous advantages, adverse outcomes can arise when customers’ expectations of VAs are not met. This paper examines how the disconfirmation of both parasocial interactions with the VA and its anthropomorphic characteristics affects users’ dissatisfaction with the VA. Such dissatisfaction might then influence subsequent behavioural outcomes, specifically spreading negative word-of-mouth about the VA (NWOMVA) and avoiding future use of VAs. Data were gathered from VA users in Egypt and the UAE via an online questionnaire. The findings from the two studies confirm that all direct hypotheses were supported and that dissatisfaction with VAs mediates the relationships between both negative parasocial interaction disconfirmation (NPID) and negative VA anthropomorphism disconfirmation and the behavioural outcomes of NWOMVA and VA avoidance. Thus, this paper offers managers guidelines on the effective characteristics of VAs, namely anthropomorphism and parasocial interaction, which allow them to identify the pitfalls of VAs and take preventive or remedial actions.}

We show that, compared to an expected cash reward, a surprise cash reward degrades evaluations of the focal brand among the more intrinsically engaged consumers. However, the negative effect of surprise reduces (1) if consumers feel that rewards signal communality (friendship) rather than a transaction and (2) if we change the reward’s format from cash to a gift card.}

Yet, the COVID-19 related theory-driven, large scale quantitative, and empirical studies are relatively scarce. This study advances the extant literature by empirically investigating how do firms in the global food value chains (GFVCs) re-imagine their businesses structure in response to the COVID-19—becoming more resilient and competitive to the current pandemic and similar future events. We leverage a unique data of 231 senior managers of the Australian GFVCs and examine their firms’ response strategies. Drawing upon key insights from the dynamic capability view, we find that GFVCs’ competitiveness is achieved when exposure to COVID-19 shocks elicits dynamic capabilities—readiness, response, recovery—and these capabilities work jointly and sequentially to cultivate resilience. A key finding of this study is that firms with domestic plus global value chain partners are more resilient than those having only global business partners. This finding implies that excessive reliance on offshoring sometimes becomes lethal, especially amid unexpected and prolonged global shocks and, therefore, companies should strike a balance between domestic and global business partners to remain competitive. These findings offer important contributions to theory, practice, and UN sustainable development goals.}

The differences manifested themselves in the form of different views concerning material well-being, house ownership, freedom, teamwork, and the general approach to working life (being a co-owner and being an employee). At the same time, we found that issues like job security, temporary contracts, part-time work, and gig working needed to be seen more in-depth instead of assuming their generic negative influence on well-being and work meaningfulness. Finally, the findings reveal that change is the name of the game for many millennial and post-millennial high-tech workers, and they may not necessarily associate these aspects negatively with work meaningfulness.}

Data were collected from 432 online apparel consumers using a survey questionnaire. First, the instrument's psychometric properties were checked, and then data was analyzed using Hayes's PROCESS macros. The results indicate that online purchase intention mediates the relationship between consumers' attitudes toward online shopping and actual purchase behavior. In addition, the results found strong support for the three-way interactions between attitude, perceived risk, and EWOM on purchase intention, and (ii) attitude, EWOM, and perceived behavioral control on actual purchase behavior mediated through purchase intention. The three-way interactions involving the double-moderation of EWOM make significant contributions to the growing literature on online buying.}

We theorize that nonprofit SPOs pursuing BMI build learning capabilities that will provide new knowledge configurations to undertake BMI and achieve greater dual value creation. While this process is driven by their dual value creation focus and perceived environmental uncertainty, a set of internal and external factors moderate the suggested relationship between BMI and dual value creation. We discuss implications of our framework for theory, future research, and practice.}

Specifically, we access the effect of business digitalization, early internationalization and internet international strategy on two possible responses to the crisis. Through the data gathered by a survey of 153 INVs, we were able to test the hypothesized framework using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. We find that all the hypothesized relationships were confirmed. Therefore, business digitalization strategy, early internationalization strategy and internet international strategy have a positive effect of both responses to the crisis: production recovery (short-term response) and digital transformation (long-term response). This study provides two insightful contributes to the international entrepreneurship field: i) these three strategies (business digitalization, early internationalization and internet international focus) incorporate dynamic capabilities that give INVs advantages in reacting to a crisis; and ii) faced with a crisis situation, INVs simultaneously implement short-term and long-term responses.}

Of many environmental variables, we focus mainly on the presence of other offers (online) and retailers (offline). We find that online and offline environmental factors have significant but different effects on the outcomes. Specifically, when more offers of the same kind are displayed in an online platform page, there are less sales and product discussion but more social referral. When a local retailer is in a region populated more by the same kind of service, sales and social interactions are both greater overall. The results suggest that these retailers should optimize their strategies according to their specific objectives when using such platforms.}

In this article, we developed a novel model for examining the antecedents and consequences of perceived firm innovativeness. We argue that when customers cognitively register changes in the value creation introduced by a firm, they perceive the firm as more innovative and, consequently, more attractive than its competitors. Using two waves of data from nationally representative samples (1,293 and 1,583 responses), we developed measures for examining changes in value creation that firms introduce and customers can perceive. We tested our theory by applying structural equation modeling to data from a nationally representative sample (5,812 responses). We found that firms that introduced changes affecting value proposition, value actualization, and interaction space were perceived as more innovative and more attractive than their competitors. Surprisingly, changes in relationship experience are negatively associated with perceived innovativeness and contribute to lower relative attractiveness in the market. One explanation is that firms introduce relationship innovations to safeguard future cash flows, which customers do not necessarily see as innovative.}

In this regard, this review aims to offer a state-of-the-art overview of gamification in business, revealing its current trends and future directions. Using business research on gamification published in the last decade (2012–2022) found on Scopus and Web of Science, we conduct a performance analysis to illuminate the field's performance (publication productivity and impact) alongside its key contributors (journals, authors, and countries) as well as a science mapping using a co-citation analysis to locate knowledge foundations, and bibliographic coupling and keyword co-occurrence analysis to reveal major themes in business gamification. Our exploration has unearthed gamification's pervasive influence across business domains, from enhancing learning and fostering innovation to empowering marketing strategies and catalyzing transformation. Gamification has also made significant inroads into management practices, driving engagement, influencing behavioral outcomes, and ushering sustainability. Peering into the future, our density-centrality quadrant analysis casts light on emerging frontiers. Noteworthily, we expect the next wave of gamification to be shaped by the allure of video games and the metaverse, bespoke industry-specific designs, confluence with e-commerce trends, emphasis on sustainable development, expanded social responsibilities, innovations in virtual reality, intersections with human urbanism, and the rise of smart cities. As gamification continues to integrate and reshape myriad facets of the business world, it holds the promise of not only enriching current practices but also charting the course for the future of innovative, sustainable, and transformative business strategies.}

The SEM results reveal that formal controls have a direct impact on market-focused learning capability and, thereby, firm performance, while informal controls strengthen this positive impact. Furthermore, results from fsQCA suggest that all configurations associated with high market-focused learning and/or high firm performance reflect high informal controls. Taken together, these results imply that informal controls serve as “hygiene factors” that are necessary but not sufficient to generate market-focused learning capability or firm performance. Finally, a firm's business strategy (i.e., cost leadership, differentiation or a dual strategy) is found to moderate the effectiveness of marketing controls: firms with a dual strategy benefit more from informal controls, while those with a clear strategy reap more benefits from formal controls.}

To address this issue, the authors use the concept of fit and propose a comprehensive conceptualization of the combination of competitor and alliance orientations; additionally, we empirically identify the combined effects of balance, alignment, and the interaction on product innovativeness. A causal-explanatory, cross-sectional, questionnaire-based design with purposive sampling was conducted. The empirical assessment used a sample of 139 senior managers in Taiwan's electronics industry (with a valid response rate of 16.85%). Research hypotheses were evaluated using partial least squares structural equation modeling, analysis of covariance, and quantile regression analyses. The results show that the relative imbalance between the competitor and alliance orientations is not significantly associated with product innovativeness. Aligning these two orientations significantly improves product innovativeness, which supports the matching perspective of coalignment. Furthermore, in relation to fit as moderation, the interaction between the two orientations is negatively related to product innovativeness. These results provide a new lens through which scholars can assess and measure the joint effects of competitor and alliance orientations and offer managerial guidance to practitioners.}

Specifically, it examines the differences in the moderating effects of price consciousness and social desirability on customers’ PWYW pricing decisions between private and public contexts. Three empirical studies are used to test the hypotheses. The findings reveal that the internal reference price and fairness perception positively affect the PWYW prices. These effects are moderated negatively (attenuated) by price consciousness and positively (enhanced) by social desirability. Moreover, the moderating effect of price consciousness is stronger in the private context, while the moderating effect of social desirability is stronger in the public context. These findings offer novel insights on the cognitive process underlying the trade-off between economic and socio-psychological boundary conditions (i.e., price consciousness and social desirability) that drive contrasting effects on customer decision-making in PWYW pricing.}

The study reveals that COVID-19 information overload through social media had a negative impact on Gen Z social media users’ psychological well-being. Moreover, perceived information overload heightened both social media fatigue and fear of COVID-19, which, in turn, increased users’ social media discontinuance intention. In addition, considering that social media is the predominant method of maintaining connectivity with others for Gen Z users during the lockdown, the fear of missing out (FoMO) buffered the impact of social media fatigue and fear of COVID-19 on Gen Z users’ social media discontinuance intention. Our research adds a hitherto underexplored perspective to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young people's mental health.

While there is a proliferation of studies on the impact of disasters on property, life, communities and the environment, much remains unknown about entrepreneurial challenges and behaviours post-disaster. This paper investigates how Entrepreneurial Marketing (EM) is enacted in post-disaster settings to facilitate speedy business recovery. We examined the post-quake experiences of small business entrepreneurs by using inductive research and adopting a ‘theories-in-use’ approach. Research propositions are developed that capture the dynamics of the business environment which influence entrepreneurial decisions, actions and EM behaviour. A new definition is offered in the light of this study and an EM Post-Disaster Business Recovery (EMPDBR) Framework is provided. This framework highlights opportunity-seeking, resource-organising, creating customer value and accepting risk (ORCAr) as concepts that are markedly different in the post-disaster context.}

However, pursuing these new channels may not be the best decision for firms even though technology allows it and, in some instances, consumers demand it. Results from an event study of SBDTC channel additions in the cable television industry show that they complicate channel relationships and can lead to conflict, which reduce firm value. Further analysis reveals that firm-specific characteristics and strategic execution factors operate to mitigate the loss in firm value. Specifically, the study results show that channel power diminishes the negative impact of channel conflict, suggesting that firms with greater channel power benefit from adding SBDTC channels. The study also finds that firms marketing high-quality, differentiated offerings are rewarded with more favorable firm valuations.}

To unpack this complexity, we establish novel actor engagement foundations to explicate value co-creation in multi-actor service ecosystems. Our research informs on value co-creation at a meta-theoretical level utilizing the explanatory power of mid-range theory. We suggest that actor pre-disposition (propensity to engage) differs from actor disposition (readiness to engage) outlined in engagement literature. Applying a longitudinal study design and using an established measurement from organizational psychology, we uncover a novel dynamic perspective on these pre-dispositions prior to and during resource investment throughout multi-actor engagement activities. Self-, social, and task pre-dispositions change over time when actors engage with one another to collaborate making this relatively stable construct of attitude “flexi-stable”.}

This influence is observed to amplify in the presence of market uncertainty and recede with an increase in firm product market experience. We validate these predictions through a mixed-method research design. Study 1 includes an original survey that gathers multi-informant responses, coupled with the subsequent year's ROA data, to assess the role of hubris and the moderating effects of market uncertainty and firm product market experience. Study 2 consists of two experimental studies that manipulate executive hubris to test its causal influence on customer acquisition and retention.

We tested this conceptual framework by using structural equation modeling (AMOS) on a database of 213 INVs.

Moreover, both strategies were critical to increase innovation performance during the pandemic. This study expands the literature in the field of international entrepreneurship in three different ways: i) it highlights the relevance of innovation performance for INVs during the pandemic; ii) it underlines the relevance of both the early internationalization and the digitization strategies to promote innovation performance; and iii) it reinforces the importance of international and digital orientations as critical resources for defining strategy.}

Using a critical case method, we study a firm that successfully challenged established market logic by systematically changing its capabilities. A longitudinal field study reveals that capability development demands induce changes to institutional foundations; then, as institutions change, further capabilities can be developed, all of which may instigate wider market innovation outcomes. This study conceptualizes this intricate, iterative process, as well as its evolutionary market innovation outcomes. The proposed three-level capability model can guide firms striving to offer new and innovative services.

Empowered by AI, voice assistants are increasingly capable of speaking and listening like humans, offering a great opportunity for a new marketing approach - voice marketing. This research examines how conversation attributes of voice assistants determine consumer trust and intention to engage in voice shopping. Using a sequential mixed-method design, three studies consistently show that consumers perceive the speaking attribute of voice assistants as more human-like than the listening attribute. We find that such incongruency between the two conversation attributes can undermine consumers' trust in voice assistants, leading to reduced willingness to accept product recommendations from voice assistants and shop via voice assistants, which would hamper the development of voice marketing. Accordingly, this research suggests that AI giants with strong technological strength and capital support should distribute more resources to advance the underlying technologies enabling human-like listening (e.g., natural language understanding and voice recognition). But for AI startups with limited financing ability and technical talents, they may consider appropriately reducing investments in the underlying technologies enabling human-like speaking (e.g., natural language generation and voice synthesis) to enhance the congruency level between the conversation attributes of voice assistants.}

To further understand brand value co-creation, we use the socio-technical theory to build a model of brand co-creation with key antecedents−social commerce information sharing, social support, and relationship quality, with privacy concerns as a moderator. Through an empirical study, we found that social commerce information sharing, social support and relationship quality positively affect brand co-creation directly/indirectly and privacy concerns moderate the effects of social commerce information sharing on brand co-creation. This article contributes to the literature on the value co-creation paradigm and social commerce by: 1) developing the concept of brand co-creation in social commerce; 2) explaining how consumers engage in online brand co-creation activities; 3) arguing that privacy concerns may hamper the effects of brand co-creation. Our study provides an innovative approach to brand management practices in today's marketplace.}

abstract = {Matrimonial applications have become an indispensable component of the matrimonial landscape in India, facilitating individuals to expand their search for possible matches and make well-informed choices on their life mates. The emergence of marital apps can be traced back to approximately ten years ago. However, there exists a significant level of uncertainty and mixed feelings regarding the acceptance and utilisation of these apps. Previous research has predominantly concentrated on interconnected domains such as online dating, social networking, and the influence of technology on relationships. However, there exists a noticeable dearth of extensive scholarly investigations that exclusively centre on marital applications. Expanding upon the theoretical framework of the Uses and Gratification theory, researchers did a longitudinal analysis over three distinct time periods, with a total of 477, 456, and 429 participants. The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors that influence purchase motivation, adoption suggestion, and user happiness within the context of marital applications. The results obtained from the structural equation modelling indicate that convenience gratification, information gratification, and personal-identity gratification are significant predictors of the purchase motive for marital applications. Furthermore, the findings from the first wave of data analysis provide confirmation of the influential role played by community orientation inside these applications. The results of the second wave of data analysis provide confirmation of the influential role played by the moderators, innovativeness and privacy concerns in enhancing consumers' intention to adopt and advocate a certain product or service. Ultimately, the results of wave 3 validate the significance of moderating variable, user experience, in augmenting user pleasure with these applications. The study elaborates that managers must acknowledge the changing dynamics in society norms and desires, as the younger generation progressively adopts technology to seek romantic partners. Furthermore, it is crucial to have efficient marketing techniques that align with the cultural intricacies of various communities in India. This study contributes to the comprehensive comprehension of consumer behaviour within the context of marital applications, providing exciting theoretical and managerial implications for the adoption and deployment of these technologies.}

We apply chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) method to categorize social media posts based on their engagement levels. We analyzed tweets that companies published in 2019 on Twitter that also publish sustainability reports on Global Reporting Initiative. The final sample is based on 3,045 tweets from 173 firms of different industries and countries. We found that tweet characteristics such as content type (SDGs), use of hashtags, existence of link, number of characters, industry type and country of a firm significantly influence stakeholder engagement rates. The most significant SGDs are partnerships for the goals, climate action, reduced inequalities, life below water, life on land, and gender equality. This is the first study which considers the communication of SDGs by firms through social media to determine which SDGs are considered most relevant and promote higher stakeholder engagement.}

The ORA is a technological tool introduced in the late 1990s, gaining proponents and detractors among practitioners and academics. Remarkably, while practitioner interest in ORAs has grown, related marketing and supply chain management (SCM) research has declined. This contradiction between theory and practice suggests the need to conduct a systematic review to provide readers with a state-of-the-art understanding of ORAs and recommend fruitful avenues for further research. We focus on the marketing literature and contrast the findings with SCM literature, in such an analysis practical relevance is stressed.

It also means that ensuing strategic efforts risk to go in vain as they possibly mirror an oversimplified reality. Making agile sense of the surrounding market context turns these two potential shortcomings into opportunities. Such contextual agility is an aptitude of some firms. It is a knowledge ability which prepares for agency in a prompt and responsive way as some representational practices translate into shaping practices. This conceptual research introduces contextual agility which hosts representational, entrepreneurial, and agile elements. This ability of individual firms promises to inform market shaping as its points of departure are clarified. It is here illustrated via contested product qualification, consumer Covid-19 vaccine skepticism.}

The main aim of this study is to explore and identify distinct sets of potential buyer segments for EVs based on psychographic, behavioral, and socio-economic characterization by employing an integrated research framework of ‘perceived benefits-attitude-intention’, The study applied robust analytical procedures including cluster analysis, multiple discriminant analysis and Chi-square test to operationalize and validate segments from the data collected of 563 respondents using a cross-sectional online survey. The findings posit that the three distinct sets of young consumer groups have been identified and labelled as ‘Conservatives’, ‘Indifferents’, and ‘Enthusiasts’ which are deemed to be buddying EV buyers The implications are recommended, which may offer some pertinent guidance for scholars and policymakers to encourage EVs adoption in the backdrop of emerging sustainable transport market.}

Leveraging insights from these buyers, we offer a comparative analysis of the role of B2B buying practices in African and Western markets and provide a grounded model addressing the role of B2B brands in organizational buying behavior. Findings indicate that the direct role of brands in business-to-business buying is contingent on several factors, including the supplier's branding strategy, the foreignness or localness of the brand, features of the brand as well as an evaluative process of purchase considerations. Our findings provide a deeper understanding into how brand value is perceived by Nigerian buyers, consequently setting the foundation for suppliers to better comprehend buyers in emerging African markets.}

Using empirical tests on a multi-industry data set gathered from 181 managers, the results show that firms that perform highly interactive OI activities should strive for high partner alignment to enhance their technology and market adaptiveness. In contrast, firms employing weakly interactive OI activities should avoid high partner alignment, as such alignment lowers the positive impact of these OI activities on both technological and market adaptiveness and, in turn, decreases innovation success.}

The study recruited 528 active users of a social AR application and used the Structural Equation Modeling (with AMOS 27) for hypothesis testing. Results show that shared sense of place, social interaction, and social identity mediate the influence of social AR usage on customer-to-customer relationships, which consequently enhance customers’ continued intention to use the social AR application. Additionally, the moderated mediation analysis result revealed that the indirect effect of social AR usage on customer-to-customer relationship is positively moderated by extraversion, such that the mediated relationship becomes stronger at a higher level of extraversion. These findings offer important contributions to the social media marketing and AR marketing literature and add valuable insights for practitioners to advance the use of AR technology.}

The purpose of this study is to investigate the interrelationships between e-impulse buying tendencies (e-IBT), e-impulse buying (e-IB), and customer satisfaction empirically (CS). The customers' intent to continue e-shopping is also investigated. Data was collected from 580 consumers in India's Union Territory of Delhi using a standardized instrument. The psychometric features of the research survey instrument were first verified using the LISREL Structural Equation Modeling Package. Hayes (2018) PROCESS was used to evaluate the moderated mediation model and hypotheses. The association between e-IBT and CS was empirically demonstrated to be mediated by e-IB. Furthermore, e-IBT is associated to e-IB in a good way. Furthermore, e-IB is positively connected to CS, indicating that consumers intend to continue shopping online. The findings also show that the e-IBT interacts with the website (first moderator) and stimulants and promotions (second moderator) to significantly influence the e-IB. Further, hedonic motives modify the e-IB-CS relationship.}

Researchers have attempted to establish masstige branding and masstige marketing as a differentiated research domain from luxury marketing. As an attempt to this end, the current study, which is confined to women's fashion clothing brands, investigates whether various luxury consumption values are equally applicable in inspiring masstige purchase. In addition, this study investigates whether dimensions of perceived authenticity of a masstige brand moderate the association between various consumption values and masstige purchase intention. By employing an online survey, 462 useable responses were collected from middle-income female consumers in India and analysed using PLS-SEM and multi-group analysis. The findings show that functional, experiential and symbolic consumption values inspire masstige fashion purchase but the zero-moment-of-truth consumption value does not. Quality and sincerity (but not heritage) dimensions of perceived brand authenticity enhance the consumption value perceptions leading to masstige purchase. This study is the first of its kind to examine the applicability of various luxury consumption values in masstige consumption besides testing the moderating effect of perceived brand authenticity.}

Equally overlooked is the interplay between consumer’s emotions and the process of consumer data collection. Two studies were conducted with the aim of closing these important gaps in the literature. Our findings revealed that overt user data collection techniques produced more favourable cognitive, attitudinal and behavioral responses than covert techniques. Moreover, consistent with the self-validation hypothesis, our data revealed that the effects of these data collection techniques can be enhanced (e.g., via happiness and pride), attenuated (e.g., via sadness), or even eliminated (e.g., via guilt), depending on the emotion experienced by the consumer while viewing an advert.}

The experiments, operationalized as (1) self-reported answers to intention measuring scales and (2) behavioral response in the form of written product reviews, reveal that the perceived integration is a significant moderator, determining the effectiveness of response strategies (deal vs. deny) on brand equity.

Specifically, we (i) integrate literature from the marketing and information systems disciplines to develop conceptualizations of AI, AI-enablement, and AI-enabled marketing capabilities, (ii) integrate literature from marketing, engineering, and computer science to develop a hierarchy of automation framework and conceptualize and delineate how automation undergirds AI’s operations, (iii) develop an integrative framework of AI-enabled marketing capabilities using AI operations, the hierarchy of automation, and the hierarchy of capabilities, and (iv) identify and apply AI’s operations to 30 exemplar marketing and marketing-related capabilities to develop propositions based on commonalities across the exemplar capabilities. In turn, we show how technology in general, and AI in particular, can help firms progress up the hierarchy of capabilities. We conclude with a discussion of the contributions of this research, implications for theory and practice, and future research avenues with exemplar research questions.}

Further, we incorporate another key firm characteristic, marketing capability, to formulate the interactive associations between CSR and firm market-side ability toward better risk management. The results show that CSR may reduce firm cash flow volatility at low and moderate levels but will increase the volatility when the engagement is high. However, a firm with high marketing capability will eliminate the negative impact of CSR.}

While the causalities underlying this relationship are not conclusively established, researchers broadly agree that higher educational attainment leads to higher income levels in dependent employment, temporary hiring, and freelancing alike. The ‘gig economy’, where workers complete jobs mediated by online platforms, challenges this paradigm as gig workers can access jobs without any educational certificates. Building a theoretical framework based on agency-driven accounts, we investigate whether we can empirically observe a relationship between educational attainment and wage levels in the gig economy. Our OLS regression analyses of 1607 gig workers in 14 Western economies illustrate no statistically significant correlation. Instead, the platform's review system as well as the gig workers' level of previous job experience serve as the major signalling mechanisms that help to reduce information asymmetry. Qualitative insights gained from in-depth interviews explain this finding by revealing how gig workers gain the necessary qualifications for their jobs, most importantly, through self-study, learning-by-doing, and trial-and-error processes. Our findings therefore point out that advanced educational credentials are only of limited use for gig workers.}

Data collected through a survey questionnaire technique from 925 members of the firm created online brand communities was employed to test the measurement and structural theory using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling respectively. The empirical results reveal that the customers’ experiential and self-esteem based benefits drive their brand community engagement. The perceived community relationship investment of the members also drives their brand community engagement positively. The sequential structural model also supported a positive impact exerted by brand community engagement on brand community commitment and brand loyalty. Additionally, it is observed that the focal brand ownership moderates the effect of community benefits and community relationship investment on brand community engagement. This study contributes to the nascent academic research on online brand communities and to the existing understanding of the brand community managers in managing customer engagement in online brand communities, thereby of profound theoretical and managerial relevance.}

Knowledge-intensive business services, the context for this study, are heavily dependent on customer resources for the fulfilment of the value proposition. Value co-creation is compromised when resources are not allocated in appropriate quality or quantity. While there is a growing body of research identifying antecedents to customer resource input, few studies investigate how customers might overcome barriers to resource allocation, particularly when faced with competing demands. This article uses a paradox perspective to explore the management of tensions affecting resource allocation. Empirically, we draw on interviews with service providers to identify perceived resource deficiencies, and with customers to explore resource allocation management. We show that it is possible to manage resource allocation tensions by devising novel solutions that integrate the two opposing demands. In addition, these solutions can result in an ‘augmented’ resource, particularly if the service provider is permitted to influence customer resource deployment. Finally, these novel solutions can activate an unintended by-product or secondary resource, enhancing the relationship between provider and customer.}

Of all the drivers of social change, alterations in food security status are one of the most disruptive to societies. Improvements can release individuals and groups from chronic hunger, malnourishment, anxieties stemming from continually having to search for the next meal and obtaining food being a full time occupation. Deterioration can lead to declining productivity, mass migrations, famine and death – all of which can spark social change. Forecasting changes in food security is, hence, important for policy makers. Improving food security requires increases in agricultural productivity. New plant breeding technologies based on genomics do not rely on controversial transgenic technology. It is important to understand the link between regulatory policy and firm's decisions to invest in the development of new crop varieties. By making the link between regulation and investment explicit suggests that the regulatory regime chosen for technological advance in genomics and associated enabling techniques should be considered carefully in the context of the need for investments in productivity enhancing technology and for forecasting food security challenges.}

We employ the springboard perspective and the global factory framework for providing theoretical foundations to our empirical exposition. We argue that the cross-border acquisitions (CBAs)-led asset augmentation strategy leads to the process of EMNEs’ evolution by internalizing intangible assets, such as brand and advanced sophisticated technology. This helps EMNEs to not only enhance their marketing- and technology-related capabilities but also to internationalize further. However, in this process EMNEs trade-off their existing production-related capabilities. We make significant contributions to the extant literature by exploring the effects of CBA-led asset augmentation strategy and extending the application of global factory framework to the case of EMNEs.}

In the restaurant industry, digital technologies are gaining growing interest among restaurateurs to improve customers’ dining experiences and thus their overall food well-being. In this research, we conduct an exploratory analysis using a qualitative multi-method approach to examine whether augmented reality (AR) technology contributes positively or otherwise to a customer's dining experience. We do so through a case study, namely Le Petit Chef AR dining experience. Our findings suggest that AR can influence positively or negatively consumers’ perceptions of their restaurant experiences according to five dimensions, namely sensory dimensions (the five senses’ intensity), the affective dimension (pleasantness), and behavioral, social, and intellectual dimensions. These dimensions can improve the customer's experience and be managed by restaurateurs to enhance positive attitudes toward AR in the restaurant industry. Furthermore, the results revealed that AR plays an essential role in terms of improving the overall food well-being of consumers and thus can lead to positive post-consumption behaviors. This study also identifies the factors that allow service providers to understand the psychology behind adopting or rejecting technology innovation in the servicescape.}

The present study investigates the impact of customer sentiment polarity on stock prices based on Indian automobile sector databased such as the Indian Nifty Auto SNE (Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, and Eicher). A top-down approach is adopted to construct a financial proxy-based sentiment index completed with sentiment extracted from automobile news and customer reviews. The paper uses a text mining approach to holistically measure customer sentiment's impact on investor sentiment and stock prices. The study was initially performed at the overall individual stock from the Nifty Auto NSE but focused on the top three passenger vehicle manufacturing companies i.e., Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, and Eicher. It was found that the sentiment index was augmented with news and customer reviews allows predicting more accurately NIFTY AUTO stock price movements. This implies that customer sentiment is a major driver of investor sentiment which in turn impacts the stock market and the firm value. Thus, the present study is an integrated approach to holistically measure customer sentiment's impact on investor sentiment and stock prices.}

Using a real-life, major optical retail store in China, 386 customers participated in a five-day experiment with different types of music (enhanced by music-recognition biometrics). The findings show that for utilitarian-type customers in a high-involvement AI purchase condition, music-recognition biometric-induced emotion mediates cognition and behavioral intentions. Both likability and the tempo of the music affect the impact of music on cognition. This study contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between cognition and emotion induced by AI-based facial and music biometric systems in shaping customer behavior and it adds to the atmospheric literature.

Hence, this paper examines why consumers participate in corporate political activities on behalf of a brand, and we present three studies to explore this increasingly popular practice. First, Study 1 utilizes qualitative interviews with actual campaign participants to provide initial insights to develop our theoretical model, which we subsequently test in two experiments. Study 2 finds that brand loyalty is a key driver of consumer activism, with both direct and indirect effects through its impact on issue salience, information seeking behavior, and its interaction with the issue type. Finally, Study 3 finds that consumer activism is associated with increased brand loyalty, indicating that this may be a relationship building activity and an important dimension of the longer process of social exchange between the brand and consumer.}

This paper contributes to the literature by using scenario-based and field experiments to examine the impact of ingredient branding on consumers' purchasing behaviours in a service context. The scenario-based experiments highlight the mediating role of quality perception on willingness to pay, which increases by up to 9 % for a food item that is ingredient branded. The results of the field experiment show that the actual sales of an item increase by 40 % when it is ingredient branded. Consequently, this paper provides both theoretical and managerial insights into the favourable impact of ingredient branding on consumers’ purchasing behaviour. This paper concludes by proposing an agenda for future research.}

The focus in this paper is to study such impact given different manufacturers' decision timing choices with regards to how they set pricing and advertising decisions. We develop a game-theoretic model that is based on consumer utility functions to represent competition between the national and store brands. We then solve six games to take into account different decision timing choices. In particular, we consider whether manufacturers decide of advertising before, after, or at the same time than pricing. Comparisons of equilibrium profits for each supply chain member before and after store brand entry under each decision timing scenario show that national brand manufacturers incur losses as a result of the retailer's store brand when they keep their decision timing unchanged. Interestingly, however, the retailer may restrain from introducing the store brand especially if the national brand manufacturers set pricing decisions before advertising, as is the case with fixed pricing contracts, and if the level of competition between the national brands is sufficiently high. Further, manufacturers can strategically change their decision timing to either benefit from, prevent or restrict losses from the retailer's store brand. These results provide new insights on how competitive interactions and contractual agreements in manufacturer-led supply chains can impact the success of store brands for retailers and mitigate or intensify their threat for national brands.}

An empirical survey of 807 participants who faced post-purchase regret as a result of brand betrayal supports the stronger (vs. weaker) emotional and behavioral effects of utilitarian (vs. hedonic) products. The findings reveal that brand betrayal for utilitarian (vs. hedonic) products leads to stronger (vs. weaker) feelings of regret. Further, the discovery of betrayal from others (vs. personal experience) intensifies the effect of brand betrayal, which is stronger for utilitarian (vs. hedonic) products. Moreover, consumers exhibit a higher intensity of brand avoidance, vindictive negative word-of-mouth, and vindictive complaining with utilitarian (vs. hedonic) products. The findings enrich regret theory and the product-type literature and provide managerial guidance for effective brand strategy formulation in brand transgressions.}

User-generated social media communication continues to increase: to the detriment of traditional media channels, where the message is controlled by destination marketing organizations. Moreover, uncontrolled user-generated communication is increasingly considered more reliable than traditional, controlled communication. All this has considerably modified tourist perceptions regarding destination image and brand equity. From a business perspective, a line of thought addressing the study of these interrelationships has emerged in the literature, going so far as to consider their impact on brand engagement. Despite the current prevalence and relevance of social media communication as a loyalty-building factor in a context as competitive as the tourism sector, relatively little literature has addressed it in emerging tourist destination scenarios. Hence, the present paper presents an analysis of how – and to what extent – social media communication, both controlled and uncontrolled by the destination organization, has an impact on destination brand equity and destination brand engagement. More specifically, this study applies it to an emerging economy scenario: Metropolitan Lima, Peru. The implications of our research, presented at the end of the paper, are of interest – both as a contribution to the literature and from the perspective of tourist destination management – and can serve to aid the economic and social development of emerging economies.}

A commercial dataset from ComScore’s US panel of one million users is used to illustrate a new approach to measure and evaluate the online performance of competitors in the US airline market. The methodology and associated performance framework demonstrate the potential for new forms of market intelligence based on the visualization of market networks, online performance calculated from matrix algorithms, the measurement of the impact of search intermediaries, and the identification of latent relationships. This research makes theoretical and empirical contributions to the debate on the use of big data for B2B market analytics. B2B managers can use this approach to extend their network horizon from an egocentric to a network view of competition and map out their competitive landscape from the perspective of the customer.}

So far, literature has relied on accounting data – specifically on reported investments in R&D and advertising – to operationalize reported strategic emphasis and studied its association with a firm’s financial performance. Previous studies suggest that firms benefit from emphasizing value appropriation. However, we show that the association between shifts in reported strategic emphasis and stock returns has actually changed over time. These days, the stock market wants firms to balance their strategic orientation. Moreover, this study not only takes a firm’s reported strategic emphasis into account but also considers what firms communicate about their strategic orientation. The study infers communicated strategic emphasis from a firm’s ‘Management Discussion & Analysis’ (MD&A) section of its Form 10-K filings. The authors develop a special purpose dictionary and show that what firms say about their strategic emphasis matters to investors in addition to what they report.

Data was collected from 254 B2B SME marketers in India through a structured questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews. At first glance, the missing link between SME performance and SNMM appears to be time, knowledge, and financial resources. SMEs that embrace innovation, proactiveness, and risk-taking can benefit from social media technologies. Thus, social networking has a direct, positive effect on SME growth. The implications for B2B SMEs’ SNMM studies are also discussed. Furthermore, the rationality of B2B marketing metrics has a tremendous influence on business success.

Specifically, we propose a sequential process of creative customer engagement, in which AR-enabled customer creativity stems from heightened customer engagement and, in turn, offers a source of intrinsic satisfaction for customers. In an experiment with a customer-facing AR application, we empirically demonstrate this sequential mediation process connecting the use of AR with customer engagement, customer creativity, and anticipated satisfaction. We also identify an important boundary condition based on a customer’s assessment orientation, suggesting a novel behavioral effect in the context of regulatory mode theory.}

This study investigates how CNFU dimensions (i.e. creative choice counter-conformity, unpopular choice counter-conformity and avoidance of similarity) drive luxury consumption intention in light of the mediating role of social comparison and the moderating role of materialism. Four hundred twenty-eight surveys completed by high-income consumers in India were used for analysis. The findings showed that social comparison mediates the effects of creative choice counter conformity and avoidance of similarity on luxury consumption. Materialism moderates these mediation effects. This study contributes to the luxury consumption literature by explaining how the interplay of psychological and social factor affects luxury purchase intention among the people driven by different uniqueness dimensions. Practically, the findings will be useful to the retailers and marketers of fashion luxury items and brands.}

abstract = {Store-in-store agreements occur when retailers lease their retail space to other retailers or brand manufacturers. Although this phenomenon is popular in practice academic research has not offered insight into how it impacts retailers. In addition, extant studies are mute on what retailer-specific characteristics determine the outcome of pursuing this strategy. Results from an event study of 185 announcements of store-in-store agreements show that they increase firm value by an average of 1.06% highlighting the effectiveness of the approach. Further analysis reveals that several characteristics of store-in-store agreements augment firm value. Specifically, positive firm value accrues when retailers enter store-in-store agreements with retail partners that are dissimilar and have a congruent brand image. The results also show that for retailers leasing retail space store-in-store agreements with reputable retailers increases their firm value. Whereas, for retailers renting retail space partnering with a retailer that has a large retail presence augments their firm value.}

Three determining factors were used—regulatory focus: promotion versus prevention; brand types: national versus private; and attribute framing: hedonic versus utilitarian—to predict consumer attitude towards the brand, its ad, and purchase intention. The results provide support for the interactions between regulatory focus and attribute framing for shampoo, and between regulatory focus and brand types for shoes. When exposed to shampoo ads, promotion focused consumers have a more positive attitude toward the ad and a higher purchase intention if the ad features utilitarian rather than hedonic attributes. Further, both promotion and prevention focused consumers prefer national brands of shoes to private labels. One possible explanation may lie in private versus public consumption of shampoo and shoes.}

These firms' characteristics and ways of working mean that digital marketing as practiced in B2C or in larger firms may be unsuitable. This paper aims to increase understanding about digital marketing in B2B SMEs, by examining the barriers they face and the digital practices that work for them. A qualitative research methodology is used to focus on these previously unexplored practices in small B2B firms operating with the oil and gas industry. The study identifies the internal and external factors linked to this B2B SME context that both influence and act as barriers to digital marketing practice. The distinctive pattern of marketing practices arising from this combination of factors and the limited role of digital marketing within it, are revealed. These insights extend the debate about digital marketing's use by showing empirically that a “one size fits all” ways of thinking about digital marketing is not appropriate for B2B SMEs. The implications for researchers and practicing managers are considered.}

However, to date, marketing and sales management literature lacks an understanding of what flexibility in marketing-sales interfaces looks like, its potential organizational consequences, and potential boundary conditions. Using data from interviews with marketing and sales managers, this study explores the nature, outcomes and facilitators of flexibility at the marketing-sales interface. This study conceptualizes marketing-sales interface flexibility (MSIF) as a process of flexible cross-functional resource exchange and finds that MSIF has positive organizational outcomes (both in terms of performance and relationship quality), that MSIF is essential for firms when dealing with exigencies in turbulent environments, and that the utility of MSIF is conditioned by the speed with which MSIF is implemented. The research contribution is twofold. At a theoretical level, the study defines the construct for the first time, revealing MSIF's conceptual composition for examination, and develops theory regarding MSIF's direct relationships with key business outcomes, as well as likely contingencies that shape its importance. At a practical level, the study's framework offers a tool that managers can use to help build organizational success through enhanced flexibility in their marketing-sales interfaces.}

The extant research has yet to investigate the role of acculturation - changes in an individual’s thoughts and behavior that result from (in)direct exposure to culturally dissimilar individuals or groups - in shaping the masstige perception of a brand. The current study addresses this gap by examining how various acculturation patterns (i.e., integration, assimilation, separation, and marginalization) assess the mass-prestige quotient of fashion accessory brands (sunglasses). The study identifies RayBan as a masstige brand in the sunglasses category and observes that the assimilation acculturation group assigned RayBan the highest masstige score, followed by the integration, marginalization, and separation groups. Furthermore, cultural worldview is identified as the underlying mechanism for differences in the masstige scores across various acculturation groups. By explaining the cultural consequences of masstige-based brand consumption, this study contributes to the growing masstige academic literature.}

Measuring the image of a country from the insider perspective can help its national stakeholders recognize COI as a valuable resource that can be translated into a Country-Specific Advantages (CSA). It thus introduces the construct ‘Country Self-image’ (CSI) that covers an insider perspective and identifies it as an antecedent of COI based CSA (COI-CSA). It adapts and validates a scale of CSI to this effect and test the relationship between CSI and COI-CSA by performing a structural equation modeling (SEM) on a dataset collected from two different surveys.

Yet, it remains unclear which capabilities customer firms require to develop, deploy, and use solutions effectively and how these capabilities differ across different solution types. This study addresses these gaps by combining a critical literature review on organizational capabilities of business customers with empirical insights gained in 20 in-depth interviews with representatives of provider firms across a wide range of industries. Using the repertory grid method, this study identifies five broader capability sets consisting of 16 organizational customer-firm capabilities and demonstrates their importance for different types of solution offerings. Theoretically, this study advances research on solution capabilities by explicating the nature, composition, and relevance of a portfolio of capabilities that customer firms require to bring into the solution process. Managerially, the results can assist solution providers in evaluating, choosing, and developing their customer base during the solution development and deployment process.}

Useable responses collected from 427 high-income Indian luxury fashion consumers were analysed using SEM and Process-Macro. The creative choice dimension enhances the purchase intention of bandwagon luxury items indirectly via social comparison while psychological entitlement strengthens this indirect effect. The unpopular choice tendency has significant direct effect on snob luxury consumption. The avoidance of similarity dimension enhances purchase intention of snob luxury items directly while it also enhances bandwagon luxury consumption indirectly via social comparison. Psychological entitlement strengthens this indirect effect.

The methodology is based on the content analysis of a sample of 3303 Facebook posts from 12 English and Spanish heritage city destinations. A Poisson regression was used to test the marketing effectiveness of the posts based on the number of Facebook reactions and message characteristics. Considering the particularities of each country, the results provide insights for DMOs for their social media message strategies. The results show that emotional messages tend to be more effective than informational messages in many cases, and several recommendations for Facebook usage are developed for the management of destinations through social media.}

To the best of our knowledge, no research to date has simultaneously focused on analyzing three different types of interactions in an empirical way, or their financial and non-financial consequences. We used longitudinal data for a sample of 1990 customers. The results show that social influence is a crucial determinant of non-transactional behaviors.

Findings from an experiment with 40 professional investors (resulting in 160 independent observations) suggested that belonging to a company's collaborative networks—where they would gain access to IA performance information—led them to adjust their investment risk assessments downward or upward in response to material weakness or strength disclosures pertaining to IA performance. Additionally, a laboratory experiment revealed that 121 novice investors who learned how to interpret and use their social networks to gain access to IA performance information also led them to adjust their investment risk assessments in response to material IA information deficiencies in target companies.

This generative user innovation necessitates new theorization to better understand the interplay between characteristics of the source innovation and the community's collective motivation. Motivation is a heightened concern in online communities where contributors often select which problems warrant their effort. Two studies improve our understanding of how the community's motivations compel remixing and impact two aspects of the depth of these remixes (improvement and differentness). First, hypotheses regarding the community's collective remix response are developed and tested. After this, an exploratory (fsQCA) study seeks out configurations of these motivations that consistently result in improved and different remixes. Using data from thingiverse.com, we show that established motivations for user innovation (enjoyment, learning, use-value) motivate remixing, but learning and use-value's effects are moderated by source innovation quality. Learning and use-value are only impactful for high quality source objects. We also demonstrate that originality of the source object has an inverted-U relationship with remixing; innovations need to be novel, but not drastically different from expectations to generate a remix response from the community.}

This in itself is surprising: this revolution implies a profound impact on the business models of companies and institutions as it pushes a new paradigm of sustainable development for healthcare and welfare systems at the global level. However, little is known about whether, to what extent, and in what direction these dynamics are impacting on the way organisations and value chains are managed, from research to care delivery.

abstract = {International new ventures (INVs) contend with environmental dynamism in global markets, compelling firms to enhance their innovation and marketing capabilities. While the INV literature is growing, it is not informative as to how INVs develop and utilize dynamic capabilities to overcome resource-constraints to enhance performance. We utilize the concept of international entrepreneurship culture (IEC) to better understand how INVs advance innovation and dynamic marketing capabilities to succeed in their internationalization activities. Building on the dynamic capabilities view (DCV), we empirically examine the relationships among IEC, ambidextrous innovation, dynamic marketing capabilities, and INV performance under varying levels environmental dynamism. The findings highlight that IEC influences both ambidextrous innovation and dynamic marketing capabilities; and, together, these link to INV performance gains. Furthermore, this research finds support for the mediating effects of ambidextrous innovation and dynamic marketing capabilities in the IEC – INV performance relationship. Additionally, the results indicate an international entrepreneurial culture is of greater significance in developing ambidextrous innovation when environmental dynamism is present. The study context is a sample of 286 high-technology INVs from India, a large and dynamic emerging market.}

Our meta-analysis uses data extracted from 149 studies reported in 135 articles. The results indicate that, as opposed to consumers who are price-conscious, individuals who are environmentally, health, and safety conscious are more likely to develop a favorable attitude toward organic goods, have a higher level of subjective norms, and maintain stronger personal behavioral control. These constructs positively affect consumer intention to buy organic goods, which ultimately leads to their actual purchase. Hofstede’s cultural dimensions (i.e., individualism, masculinity, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, indulgence) were also found to play a pivotal role in moderating most causal relationships between constructs of the model. It was also revealed that studies focusing on organic food exhibited stronger effects on construct associations compared to studies examining non-food products.}

This empirical study was conducted through the perceptual lens of two key stakeholder groups: incumbents and family owners. And applied two methods, collected in two phases. The first included a survey with 52 family-owned wineries operating across the Republic of Cyprus, and the second encompassed 16 in-depth personal interviews with incumbents and successors from six wineries. The originality and novel theoretical contribution of the paper is twofold: (a) it employs, expounds and interrelates extant theories with solid empirical findings to provide a descriptively comprehensive understanding of the key market-oriented family business succession principles within Cyprus’s family-owned wine industry, and (b) it prescriptively develops the WineSuccess Framework®, which unequivocally intertwines 16 fundamental factors that contribute to the implementation of an effective market-oriented succession process in the same and comparable contexts.}

This research proposes a conceptual model incorporating the Status Quo Bias (SQB) and the Negative Online Purchase Decision-Making Process (NOPDMP) to suggest a new framework for evaluating the maintained consumer behavior of online shopping platforms. The questionnaires following the proposed conceptual model were collected from the sample data from participants of 384 experienced respondents using online shopping platforms. Data were analyzed for the causal relationship using Structural Equation Model. The implications of the assessment framework that incorporates the influence of negative factors can weigh the decision to purchase products and improve and reduce shopping cart abandonment on e-commerce platforms.

In order to fill this knowledge gap, in this paper, we extended the operations strategy to the TOC context to examine with more precision the influence of TOC elements upon the competitive priorities high speed, on-time delivery, high flexibility, low cost, and high quality. A multi-method approach was adopted, combining both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Findings suggest that the primary competitive dimensions leveraged by TOC elements are on-time delivery and high speed, followed by high flexibility. Also, primarily, Scheduling Process (DBR and S-DBR), Critical Chain Project Management, TOC Replenishment for Distribution and Dynamic Buffer Management influence the competitive dimensions with different intensity levels and overlaps. The first contribution of this paper is in offering a better comprehension of the significant overlaps existing between various TOC elements and their simultaneous influence on firm's operational performance. Second, we provide prescriptive strategies to firms for prioritising managerial efforts and resources while implementing TOC elements, in isolation or combined with other management philosophies. Third, the paper enhances understanding of how to improve decision-making and to manage conflicting strategic objectives affecting the firms’ competitiveness. The added value and originality of this paper is in (i) minimising the lack of knowledge regarding whether and how TOC elements affect the competitive priorities in operations strategy; (ii) enable decision-makers to evaluate their continuous improvement initiatives adopted as part of the operations strategy and, eventually, select other managerial philosophies to enhance the competitive dimensions and operational performance; (iii) enable a better organisational design, attenuating the trade-offs among conflicting strategic objectives in OSCM.}

Millions of people participate in popular sharing economy platforms (SEPs) such as Airbnb and Uber. Although sharing economy research has gained interest, yet a holistic model that explains the formation of consumer value co-creation intentions on such platforms remains absent. The purpose of this study is to develop a model of the antecedents of consumers value co-creation intentions at SEPs and evaluate it empirically. Building on social support theory, relationship quality theory, value co-creation and marketing ethics literature, we propose a theoretical model that explains the formation of consumers’ value co-creation intentions. Empirical data was collected from n = 342 Generation Y consumers and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results reveal that social support influences ethical perceptions, which further influences value co-creation. Ethical perceptions also influence consumers' trust, satisfaction and commitment with the SEP. However, trust and commitment do not influence value co-creation intentions. Our study contributes to the literature on sharing economy by providing a holistic model of the antecedents of consumers’ value co-creation intentions. We also offer important insights for SEP managers.}

Experiment 2 employed a 2 (content generator type: Instagram celebrity vs. mainstream celebrity) x 2 (gender: female vs. male) factorial design. Experiment 3 deployed a 2 (branded content type: photos listing products vs. photos showing models) x 2 (content generator type: commercial brand [corporate] vs. Instagram celebrity [human]) factorial design. Experiment 1 indicates Instagram influencers' photo types and gender moderate the effects of envy toward and PSI with them on consumers' intention to buy the products Instagram influencers are wearing. Experiment 2 shows content generator types and gender moderate the effects of envy and PSI on source trustworthiness perception. Experiment 3 demonstrates branded content types and content generator types moderate the effects of consumers' physical appearance social comparison tendency, compulsive buying tendency, and materialistic envy on brand trust.

Existing works address the joint lot-sizing and pricing problem without backlogging, although it is a usual strategy that permits to satisfy customer demand with delay. In this work, we study a new multi-product joint lot-sizing and pricing problem with backlogging and limited production capacity. The objective is to maximize the total company profit over a finite planning horizon. For the problem, a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation is given. Then, several optimality properties are provided and a tighter MINLP model is established based on these properties. According to the NP-hard nature and non-linearity of the model, a model based heuristic that focuses on efficiently solving small-sized instances is proposed and a genetic algorithm (GA) with new progressive repair strategy is developed to address large-sized instances. Managerial insights are drawn based an illustrative example. Numerical experiments are conducted on 64 benchmark based instances and 105 randomly generated instances with up to 10 products and 12 periods, which validates the MINLP formulation and shows the efficiency of the proposed solution methods.}

MPFDT utilizes two independent knowledge-based process behaviour models of the manufacturing system to satisfy the FADI purpose. The fundamental idea is to detect the inconsistencies between the modelled and the observed manufacturing process behaviour. The first model is a Deterministic Finite-state Automaton (DFA) based model of the PLC control process that is used to determine whether the observed state transition behaviour of the PLC control process is consistent with the modelled state transition behaviour or not. The second model is basically a set of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based one-class classifiers that are used to identify whether any significant difference exist between the observed and the reference electrical power consumption profile of the manufacturing system or not. The experimental results show that the FADI accuracy rate of the proposed tool is very high (more than 98%).}

Therefore, the gap existing between the potential of value creation embedded in the Big Data paradigm and the current limited exploitation of this value represents an area of investigation that this paper aims to explore. In particular, by following a systematic literature review, this study aims at presenting a framework that outlines the multiple value directions that the Big Data paradigm can generate for the adopting organizations. Eleven distinct value directions have been identified and then grouped in five dimensions (Informational, Transactional, Transformational, Strategic, Infrastructural Value), which constitute the pillars of the proposed framework. Finally, the framework has been also preliminarily applied in three case studies conducted within three Italian based companies operating in different industries (e-commerce, fast-moving consumer goods, and banking) in the final aim to see its applicability in real business scenarios.}

Consequently, these links have outlined an extended digital marketing impact in the areas which build on marketing and sales and influence growth components such as product & market testing, customer engagement, and partnership development. Through a systematic literature review, we present a holistic overview encompassing start-up growth areas that use digital marketing. We also discuss how digital marketing efforts complement the start-up maturity. Furthermore, we analyze the differences in B2B and B2C digital marketing usage and discuss how emerging technologies impact digital marketing. The link between the extended digital marketing impact, start-up challenges, and growth areas result in the identification of start-up growth drivers supported by digital marketing.

abstract = {Big Data represents a promising area for value creation and frontier research. The potential to extract actionable insights from Big Data has gained increasing attention of both academics and practitioners operating in several industries. Marketing domain has become from the start a field for experiments with Big Data approaches, even if the adoption of Big Data solutions does not always generate effective value for the adopters. Therefore, the gap existing between the potential of value creation embedded in the Big Data paradigm and the current limited exploitation of this value represents an area of investigation that this paper aims to explore. In particular, by following a systematic literature review, this study aims at presenting a framework that outlines the multiple value directions that the Big Data paradigm can generate for the adopting organizations. Eleven distinct value directions have been identified and then grouped in five dimensions (Informational, Transactional, Transformational, Strategic, Infrastructural Value), which constitute the pillars of the proposed framework. Finally, the framework has been also preliminarily applied in three case studies conducted within three Italian based companies operating in different industries (e-commerce, fast-moving consumer goods, and banking) in the final aim to see its applicability in real business scenarios.}

Two empirical studies, an online experiment about a hair salon using PWYW pricing and a field-survey with customers of a real-life PWYW restaurant, are used to test all the hypotheses. In study one, situational involvement has significant direct and indirect effects on the customers’ allocation of internal reference prices to their PWYW prices (RATIO), whereas enduring involvement has a positive (negative) effect under low (high) situational involvement. In study two, both enduring and situational involvement have no significant direct effects on RATIO but situational involvement has a significant negative (positive) effect for participants with low (high) enduring involvement. Besides extending both PWYW and involvement literatures, these findings would help managers understand the direct and indirect effects of situational variables on customers’ PWYW pricing decisions.}

In this sense, it has become very difficult for brands to differentiate themselves from one another. Therefore, providing good experiences to consumers becomes of paramount importance. The current study provides insights into the relationship between experiential value (cognitive, hedonic, social, and ethical) and consumer engagement (cognitive processing, affection, and activation), resulting in brand relationship performance outcomes that in turn lead to value co-creation intentions. In addition, the role of self-brand connection as a moderator and consumer engagement as a mediator is also examined. A large-scale survey was conducted with 485 consumers who follow brand pages at a popular social networking site. The findings reveal that experiential value has a positive impact on consumer engagement, while consumer engagement is positively associated with brand loyalty and satisfaction, which in turn leads to value co-creation. The current study uncovers the ways in which marketers can capitalize on consumer experiences when engaging in social commerce and thereby enhance value co-creation.}

By examining 230 Australasian firms exporting to Greater China region, we found out that customer relationships have a significant effect on export performance while supplier relationships do not have such effect. To better understand development of B2B relationships, we examined the role of immigrant manager in building of such relationships to confirm that the interaction of customer relationships and immigrant manager has a positive impact on export performance whereas the interaction of supplier relationships and immigrant manager does not have a positive effect on performance. We also included PCD into the conceptual model to explore its influence on the interaction between customer and supplier relationships and immigrant manager and how it affects the export performance. This inclusion demonstrated the importance of immigrant manager in developing customer relationships when PCD is high, however the interaction between supplier relationships, PCD and immigrant manager does not have any significant effect. The results of our study therefore have important implications of when and how immigrant managers can be employed to positively influence development of B2B relationships and improve export performance. This study also makes a significant theoretical contribution to B2B relationships and export performance literature by closing gaps in understanding of the role of PCD and immigrant manager in building of efficient inter-cultural B2B relationships and making a distinction between B2B relationships customer and supplier effects.}

The purpose of this study is to select the most appropriate method of acquiring interactive TV technology for MTN Irancell Telecommunication Company using a combined model of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. Therefore, in this research, in the first stage of structuring, the list of criteria and alternatives was determined based on a literature review. Then, in the assessment phase, the fuzzy Delphi technique was used to finalize the list of criteria and alternatives, and then an improved fuzzy group hierarchical best-worst method (fuzzy G-HBWM) was used to determine the criteria weights and evaluate the alternatives by an expert group to form a decision matrix. Finally, in the ranking stage, the alternatives were ranked using fuzzy multi-attribute decision-making (F-MADM) methods including ARAS-F, fuzzy TOPSIS, fuzzy WASPAS, fuzzy VIKOR, fuzzy MABAC, and fuzzy SAW. Then, the Integer Linear Program (ILP) model was used to aggregate the ranking. Based on the results, the main criteria in order of importance are: technology factors, environmental and market factors, organizational factors, and partner or vendor factors. Also, the most important sub-criteria can be considered, respectively, as: the innovative rate in the industry, the degree of strategic importance of technology, the need for access to technology, and the ability to share assets. The final ranking results showed that turnkey contracts, stock ownership, and outsourcing are the top three alternatives in order of priority.}

Within the servitization domain, however, they are only starting to receive attention. This paper explores the tensions that industrial firms encounter when attempting to integrate services and solutions into their offerings. Following an exploratory multiple case study approach, we identify several tensions experienced at the intra- and interorganizational levels by three industrial firms. By drawing on the four flows model—activity coordination, organizational self-structuring, institutional positioning, and membership negotiation—we identify tensions at the intersection of the flows. The findings elucidate how many of the identified tensions become knotted and movement across organizational levels is created through communicative processes. We make contributions to the literature by drawing on communicative processes to explain how paradoxical tensions emerge within a servitization context and become entangled. As servitizing firms move toward offering advanced services, they are likely to face an increasing number of tensions spanning intra- and interorganizational levels. Our study raises important implications as inextricable entanglements between tensions creates complexity, which requires managers to focus more clearly on the challenge of coping with these on an ongoing basis.}

Analyses of the relationship between size and four distinct specialization strategies in a sample of 96 European incubators show that incubator size is positively related to a strategic focus on universities and research institutes as recruitment channels and to a focus on sustainability, but unrelated to industry focus. Incubator size was found to be negatively related to a regional focus. While sustainability focused incubators tended to not find recruitment challenging, paradoxically, among those who did, the most frequently reported challenges were related to finding tenants that focus on sustainability. Post-hoc analyses revealed that tenants with a focus other than sustainability often dominate sustainability-oriented incubators, suggesting that sustainability may be more of a legitimating strategy than an explicit selection criterion.}

However, by integrating the attention-based view, we raise a question as to why VRIN-O resources alone are not sufficient for sustainable performance. We introduce the variable - decision-makers’ attention- as a key moderator in achieving sustainable performance so that VRIN-O/capability and capability/resource heterogeneity may last longer. To test this relationship, we examine how the needs of firms to balance their exploration and exploitation efforts, called relative exploration anchored to resource-based theory is influenced by CEO’s attention towards entrepreneurial orientation and market orientation as moderators. Using a panel data set of 269 firms listed on the Nordic NASDAQ stock exchange, we find an inverted U-shaped relationship between relative exploration and long-term performance, while the attentions of the CEO have a positive moderation effect. Thus, using the attention-based view complements the resource-based theory in explaining sustainable competitive advantage especially in the dynamic environment.}

Based on a focused reading of literature on business fields, business networks, business ecosystems, and market systems, we venture our own comprehensive theoretical framing of complex business environments summarized in two frameworks. In the pursuit of relevance our integration is avowedly simplifying as we strive for parsimony. Key points explicate the nested, multi-layered, multimodal, transitional and conditioned character of the business environment, and the dynamics, phases and processes of the evolution of that nested environment. We use the frameworks constructed, which form an initial theory of complex business environments, to supply a research agenda for business marketing and offer brief managerial conclusions.}

The results of DY suggest that, first, the total connectedness of 21st century technology assets and traditional common stocks is very high, and hence in the turbulent economy, there is a high probability of contemporaneous losses. Second, Bitcoin, MSCIW, MSCI US, and KFTX are net contributors of volatility shocks whereas US dollar, oil, gold, VIX, green bond and green bond select are net receivers. Therefore, Fintech and common equities are not good hedging instruments in the same portfolio. Third, the short-term witnesses higher volatility transmission than the long-term. That is, holding assets for a long-term is likely to mitigate risks whereas trading financial assets in the short-term can increase risk because of higher volatility. Fourth, the traditional assets, gold and oil, as well as modern assets, green bonds, are useful as good hedgers compared with other assets because shock transmissions from them to Fintech, KFTX are below 0.1% and, more importantly, the total volatility spill-over of all assets in the sample is moderately average, accounting for 44.39%.}

Existing research suggests that most marketing strategies suffer due to poor implementation; however, the nuances of strategy implementation impediments and their accompanying remedies remain underdeveloped. To contribute to this line of inquiry, the authors use multi-level qualitative data to capture cross-functional dynamics that traverse the organizational hierarchy and are critical to marketing strategy implementation. The data collection procedure consisted of depth interviews with 48 informants within eight organizations, constituting sales-marketing dyads at three hierarchical levels (senior, middle, and frontline) within each organization. Findings suggest that sales and marketing personnel’s varying self-interests at different hierarchical levels motivate them to engage in a distinct set of inter- and intra-functional activities that foment implementation impediments. In turn, findings explicate not only the individual effects of these impediments but also their cumulative between-level (trickle-down) and within-level, within-function (trickle-around) impact as the strategy moves through the hierarchy of the sales-marketing interface. The authors then offer prescriptive remedies embedded in the informal organization that may stabilize the implementation process. Viewed holistically, this study contributes to marketing literature by inductively deriving a theory of marketing strategy implementation within the sales-marketing interface.}

We argue that to be able to offer a customized incubatee-strengthening service pack, incubator-incubatee interaction is key, requiring clear-cut and directive service co-development instructions, which is our focal construct. To better understand the functioning of this focal construct, we adopt a contingency approach to examine how the incubator's human capital, and the institutional environment impact the incubator's service co-development directiveness. A quantitative empirical study reveals that both human capital and an entrepreneurially-minded regulative and cognitive institutional environment allow an incubator to be directive, thereby laying a foundation for co-development of customized service offerings. Moreover, the incubator's human capital turns out to further stimulate the positive effects of an entrepreneurially-minded regulative environment. All in all, we find that both internal organizational and external institutional elements are pivotal for first-best implementation of the internal sponsorship mechanism ‘service co-development directiveness’.}

Based on the theory of expected utility, we expand upon traditional frequency-driven rule analytics by integrating three business-relevant factors (target size, conversion profit, and conversion likelihood) into the process of generating recommendations for FOUs in digital content markets. The framework was tested using two different types of empirical analysis. We conducted a field experiment collaborating with a nationwide e-book store to determine how FOUs responded to the recommendations generated under the proposed framework. Furthermore, we analyzed over 5 million transactions collected from the e-book seller and a mobile application provider to examine the impact of customer segmentation on the effectiveness of our approach. Our findings suggest that business analytics derived from the utility-based mechanisms can significantly enhance digital content providers' business performance.}

The findings of our study of US born global SMEs support this theorization. Market-learning capability operates in a complex set of relationships with other learning capabilities in its contribution to innovation. Interestingly, relative to technical innovation, administrative innovation makes a prominent contribution to international market outcomes.

Over the past few years, many researchers have focused on developing SCRES strategies that have significantly contributed to mitigating SC disruptions. While the number of papers on this subject has been gradually increasing, the absence of a systematic literature review means that it is unclear which SCRES strategies for mitigating SC disruptions have already been studied and which issues still need to be investigated. Therefore, there is a need to conduct a systematic literature review to provide a comprehensive overview of SC resilience initiatives and strategies. For the review and synthesis conducted in this paper, 151 relevant articles were identified through a systematic search and selection of papers published between 2010 and 2021. First, the main themes of the SCRES strategies were categorized. The development of SCRES strategies for preparedness, response, and recovery, aimed at mitigating SC disruptions, was reviewed. Second, a detailed analysis of research developments in SCRES strategies was conducted, along with an investigation into the methodological, theoretical, and contextual justifications for tackling SC disruptions. Third, literature on SCRES strategies was synthesized for mapping and identifying potential research gaps. The analysis revealed that there is a scarcity of simulation model-based and theoretically grounded studies to mitigate large-scale SC disruptions. Moreover, it was also found that most studies have identified SCRES strategies for low-demand luxury products, while high-demand essential products and services have largely been ignored. Finally, based on the analysis, this article identifies research questions and future research directions for the field of SCRES research. These can guide academics and practitioners in designing and leading effective research in the field.}

This study fills this void in the literature by conceptualizing and testing a comprehensive model to investigate the impact of user orientation toward technology use by digital natives (DNs) and digital immigrants (DIs) on technology continuous use behavior. The effect of DNs and DIs is currently gaining the attention of researchers. This study investigated the postadoption and use behavior of these groups using a three-wave panel model and with decomposed theory of planned behavior (DTPB) as the initial adoption model. The longitudinal model is a unified framework that sheds light on four different mechanisms underlying postadoption phenomena: (1) the belief judgment evaluation processes suggested by the DTPB model, (2) sequential updating mechanism, (3) feedback mechanism, and (4) habit mechanism. Based on multigroup analysis, we show that a clear pattern of differences in effect exists between DNs and DIs with respect to the sequential belief updating mechanism and that these results are relatively stable over time.}

This study aims to identify the role of information management (IM) and knowledge management (KM) in shaping performance in entrepreneurial firms. Moreover, the study aims to examine the causal relationship between IM and KM. Our sample consisted of 150 small and medium-sized firms that manufacture furniture in Poland. This is a mix-method study; it uses structural equitation modeling (SEM), fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), and interview-based qualitative analysis to examine the associations among entrepreneurial orientation (EO), IM, KM, and firm performance. In particular, three types of outcomes are analyzed; namely, firm competitiveness (FC), firm growth (FG), and financial performance (FP). The results unveiled the impact of IM on KM; the findings also showed the positive role of EO in shaping IM and KM as well as firm performance. In general, IM and KM impact firm performance; however, their individual impacts depend on the performance type (when they interact, they constitute a sufficient condition for achieving a high level of performance regardless of the type). These findings contribute to the IM and KM literature as well as entrepreneurship and small business research.}

Relying on abductive logic and a qualitative multiple case study research, this study unveils the micro-processes and mechanisms through which interorganizational relationships within a cooperative and a community allow firms to operate on a continuum comprised of social value generation, sharing and replication practices. An embedded form of stewardship emerges as a core mechanism for interorganizational social impact activities. A conceptual model, based on generating, sharing and replicating processes of social impact is proposed. Implications and opportunities for further research are presented.}

Sixty interviews were conducted with subsistence consumers in two areas: Kolkata and Kharagpur, in the Indian state of West Bengal. The findings have demonstrated that subsistence consumers are compelled to stick to their neighbourhood retailers due to convenience, social capital, and obligations, as well as social identities resulting from a sense of social compulsion, and the value-added services provided by retailers that help overcome the consumers' financial and cognitive constraints. This study contributes to the literature on customer behaviour and retailing. These findings deepen the current understanding of the social capital theory, social identity theory, and bounded rationality theory in the context of subsistence marketplaces. Practically, the findings of this study will contribute to the practice of marketers who target subsistence markets. The findings will also help further entrepreneurial activities in subsistence areas, improve the retailing operations of subsistence retailers, and address exploitative practices of subsistence retailers on poor customers.}

The paper develops a model in which these two capabilities are linked with market expansion and product expansion, whereby market expansion facilitates product expansion. The survey data is based on a sample of 590 Polish companies and provides empirical support for the hypothesized links. The trade-off effect related to the parallel development of marketing capabilities and innovation capabilities receives partial support. The results are compared with prior research in the field and the observed international expansion paths of companies from transforming countries. The study contributes to the limited knowledge on organic, resource-based modes of growth among companies from transitional economies that expand in asymmetrical power international markets. Overall, the study recommends investing in marketing and innovation capabilities as versatile resources that can help companies from transforming countries to expand in competitive international markets.}

Five experiments provide convergent support for this proposition and the boundary condition of this positive effect. The positive effect of the synchrony experience on product evaluation occurs only for products that are closely related to the synchrony experience.}

For this purpose, participatory culture is first proposed as an alternative conceptual framework, followed by empirical research, which upgrades visual content analysis (VCA) with semiotic analysis. The findings of VCA reveal that memes yield a markedly different representation of Thailand as they introduce an entire cluster of peculiar and controversial themes, which are not depicted on destination marketing organization (DMO) and TripAdvisor photos. Semiotic analysis, in addition, uncovers that memetic representation is evocative and conveys a layer of symbolic notions and alluding connotations. In this manner, findings attest that memes are a semantically rich format and genre of UGC, which expands existing knowledge about destination-image formation and representation on social media.

Hierarchical regression analyses are conducted to test the research model based on the data collected from 270 manufacturing firms in China. The results suggest that knowledge breadth and depth affect knowledge sharing intention in opposite directions. Specifically, firms with a broad knowledge base are more likely to share their knowledge in interfirm cooperation, whereas firms with deep knowledge are reluctant to share. More importantly, the empirical results suggest that both strategic consensus and bilateral specific asset investments positively moderate the relationships between knowledge structure attributes and knowledge sharing intention, implying that both mechanisms can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of knowledge sharing and consequently, affect senders’ intention to share their knowledge.}

abstract = {This research examines how shared leadership affects team performance over time. We argue that shared leadership, conceptualized and measured as team members’ network density of mutual leadership and influence, affects team performance because it enhances the team’s transactive memory system (TMS) – a system of distribution and retrieval of team members’ specialized knowledge. Based on a seven-wave longitudinal study, we developed a dynamic model to capture the mediation effect of TMS and the temporal effect of shared leadership and TMS on future team performance. With observations on the full life cycle of the teams participating in the project, we found that shared leadership had a positive effect on team performance and that TMS mediated this positive relationship. In addition, we found that the effect of shared leadership on team performance was stronger during the early stages of the team life cycle, and again TMS mediated this conditional effect.}

Therefore, this study conducts a technology-empowered systematic literature review using a combination of fit-for-purpose bibliometric software to examine the state of the literature on religion and EB research. The review reveals that existing research in the field have mainly focused on how religions such as Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam influence consumerism, corporate social responsibility, sustainability, leadership orientation, organizational culture, financial and social ethics, and socioeconomic development, and that future research can enrich the field by investigating religion in tandem with business education, marketing, economics and public policy, and cognitive characteristics and behavioral inclinations, as well as the reversed influence of EB on religious orientation.}

It also offers theoretically supported and validated scales to measure them. The authors empirically investigate their performance effects using different kinds of data pertaining to consumer brands, gathered from manager surveys, brands’ financial statements, Facebook fans, Instagram followers, YouTube subscribers, and brand image measures. The proposed social media resources and capabilities improve social media performance directly and brand perception indirectly. In particular, the impact of the social media strategy and measurement is moderated by firm size. A profile deviation analysis further reveals that the social media capabilities gap between top-performing versus other brands explains significant variance in social media performance. The advantages of developing social media capabilities early on also persist in the long-term, with substantial relevance for managers.}

Absent formal insight regarding how a firm-wide OI approach to strategy emerges, we introduce the premise that a firm-wide practice requires influence from those at the top of firm hierarchy, i.e., its Board of Directors. We posit that if the OI construct is both: (1) strategic rather than tactical in nature, and (2) enterprise-wide rather than function specific (e.g., marketing), then firm-wide adoption requires BOD acceptance, if not advocacy and leadership. We present 10 research propositions that describe how the board influences a firm-wide OI approach to strategy and provide specific implications for scholars from marketing and corporate governance as well as boards and chief marketing officers.}

Building upon the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework, the current study constructed an integrated model to demonstrate perceived destination eco-friendly reputation as a stimulus; consumption emotions (positive and negative) as organism; tourism satisfaction, recollection, tourist environmentally responsible behavior (ERB) as response. Notably, tourists' recollection is seen within this S-O-R framework as the formation mechanism for prescribed action and consequently as an example of script theory and the generation of consumer responses, thus connecting elements of behavioral and cognitive psychology in a unified framework. Survey data from 522 Chinese tourists were used to empirically examine the integrated tourist ERB model. The findings suggest that destination eco-friendly reputation positively impacts both positive emotions and tourist satisfaction, and eco-friendly reputation negatively impacts negative emotions. Positive emotions significantly and positively influence tourist satisfaction, tourists' recollection, and ERB. Conversely, negative emotions have a significant negative effect on these constructs. Moreover, tourist satisfaction positively influences recollection and ERB, and recollection in turn positively affects ERB. Theoretical insights and practical implications are discussed in this paper.}

Realizing the pattern of product family evolution along with proper estimation of features for future products has been regarded as a critical issue for business success. Focusing on this issue, a dynamic model for product family evolution combined with forecasting is proposed in this research work. The proposed model considers the influence of market demand, customer needs and technological requirements that are time-dependent. The methodology is a four-phase model. In this model the evaluations of product family evolution are based on the Grey Relational Analysis and Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process. Sensitivity is performed to investigate the reliability of the model. In addition, a data-driven neural network-based forecasting model is proposed that can forecast the specification of the most influential features of future product with a reasonable accuracy. This forecasting model utilizes the information of the previous generation’s product. For each phase, the effectiveness of the developed approach is demonstrated with numerical simulation results and validated with a case study of Apple’s iPhone product family. The case study shows that the approach is very effective to identify the most influential key design features and best performed products that will influence the evolution design of future product.}

Yet, blockchain is still nascent, and the extant literature on this technology is scarce, especially as regards the relationship between blockchain and SCM. Additionally, existing studies have not yet addressed sufficiently the enablers of blockchain adoption and the interplay with supply chain performance. In order to reduce this gap, this study aims to examine the potential influence of blockchain on supply chain performance. We draw on the literature on technology adoption and supply chain performance, as well as on the emerging blockchain literature, to develop and test a model in two countries, namely India and the US. Accordingly, we administered a survey in order to review the opinions and views of supply chain practitioners. The results support the model and indicate that blockchain applications can improve supply chain performance. In particular, our findings suggest that knowledge sharing and trading partner pressure play an important role in blockchain adoption, and that supply chain performance is significantly influenced by supply chain transparency and blockchain transparency. Another finding was the inexistence of evidence for a moderation effect of the industry variable on the outcomes. The research conclusions have substantial managerial and theoretical implications. Our model contributes mainly to the theoretical advancement of SCM-blockchain, thus allowing scholars to adapt our validated model.}

abstract = {Research suggests that customer-brand disidentification is a pertinent source for the breakdown of consumer-brand relationships and a reason why consumers turn against brands. However, practical and theoretical interest in the study of customer-brand disidentification has been hindered by the absence of a reliable scale with confirmed predictive validity. As a result, the purpose of this study is to develop, operationalize, and test a measure of customer-brand disidentification based on a theoretically valid definition. Drawing on data from six samples, as well as a thorough literature review, the authors develop and validate a scale for measuring customer-brand disidentification. Furthermore, via the application of a nomological net, the authors reveal that customer-brand disidentification is predicated on negative customer emotions after being violated by a brand in a contract breach. Various consumer-based outcomes including patronage reduction and negative word of mouth are found to be consequences of customer-brand disidentification.}

abstract = {Mobile banking (m-banking) is the fastest growing and most cost-effective channel for delivering banking services. Electronic word of mouth (eWOM) plays a crucial role in the success of e-commerce. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to investigate a comprehensive moderated mediated mechanism for enhancing m-banking adoption behavior through positive eWOM triggers using the elaboration likelihood model (ELM). Argument Quality, valence, consistency and volume were considered eWOM triggers, and the conceptual model also included initial trust in m-banking as a mediator and consumer involvement in m-banking as a moderator. A total of 1153 useable surveys completed by the Indian users of social networking websites were used for analysis. The findings showed that of the triggers, argument quality, valence, and consistency enhance intention to adopt m-banking. These effects were mediated by initial trust in m-banking. The mediation effects of initial trust between valence – Intention varied between high and low consumer involvement in m-banking. These findings make several contributions to the literature on marketing communication, particularly to eWOM research and ELM theory. Practically, this study provides several recommendations to banks about how to use positive eWOM for motivating consumers to adopt m-banking.}

Yet this large body of literature fails to provide managers with specific practical guidance about how to create brand-extension fit for optimal results. The problem is a lack of understanding of what brand-extension fit really is, and there has been little work to address this issue by synthesizing the key dimensions of brand-extension fit. The current article addresses this gap by identifying the key constituent dimensions of brand-extension fit. This is an important topic because brand extensions are essential for business renewal and growth. We identify six dimensions of brand-extension fit: feature-based, function-based, resource-based, usage-occasion-based, market-based, and image-based fit. Each dimension addresses a different aspect of brand-extension fit and suggests ways for brand managers to create brand-extension fit. Less expected is that studies that use a strict subset of these dimensions overweight those fit dimensions that are included, and the associated estimated coefficients are biased. From a managerial perspective, counterfactual analysis also shows that reliance on a strict subset of these dimensions results in suboptimal decisions.}

Strategic alliances offer SEs access to various resources, and bricolage helps SEs mobilize the assets at hand by ‘making do with everything available’. However, the dynamics between the two strategies and their impact on the SEs’ performance remain underexplored. Drawing upon a resource-based view through an input-process-output lens and integrating resource dependence theory, this study explores the mechanism of strategic alliances, bricolage, and social impact scaling and investigates the role of entrepreneurial orientation within it. Using evidence drawn from a survey of 278 Chinese social firms, this research views strategic alliances and bricolage as an effective ‘strategic bundle’ for improving SEs’ social performance and sheds new light on the bricolage-mediated resource management mechanism within SEs. We suggest that social entrepreneurs practice alliance-specific bricolage strategies to convert resources into superior social performance.}

Study 1 shows that consumers are more willing to offer support to a nonprofit if they believe the nonprofit has extensive sponsorship engagement. Further, Study 1 shows that people’s perceptions of their donations’ impact on the nonprofit transmit the positive effects of sponsorship engagement to willingness to donate. Study 2, which is based on different sponsorship rosters and different measures, confirms Study 1 findings regarding the direct effects of sponsorship engagement on willingness to support and the indirect effects on willingness to donate.

To expand the current state of theory, we draw upon twelve case studies of SM management concerning tactics for acquiring new and potential relationships, building a reputation online, and engaging with business partners.

This article aims to identify the key contributors and knowledge structure of business and management research involving the application of complexity theory and fsQCA. Using bibliographic data of 1,155 articles extracted from Scopus, our review conducts (1) a performance analysis to shed light on the field's key contributors based on the criteria of journal, article, author, institution, and country, and (2) a scientific mapping using keyword cooccurrence and PageRank to reveal three knowledge clusters and the prominent articles in each cluster.

Previous to the in-depth interviews, individuals reported all touchpoint encounters as their decision journey unfolded via a mobile electronic diary. Experience reports, consumer responses, and visual data were also gathered. A sequence analysis was employed to identify touchpoint and channel contacts and then perform a sequential pattern analysis. The results indicate that more and more variable touchpoints and activities exist for the high involvement product. Four decision journey maps were found for each product. However, journey sequences are more complex, non-linear, and dynamic for smartphone purchase. This study enriches both consumer decision-making and involvement theories, in that its new innovative forms of data gathering (i.e., mobile diaries) enable a more rigorous identification and understanding of current omnichannel decision journeys for products of distinct involvement classifications. The results provided by this complementary innovative method can orient marketing managers in understanding actual touchpoint contacts and developing differentiated strategies that address various consumer groups.}

Moreover, further academic research on multi-stakeholder engagement to develop collaborative and strategic alliance-led social innovation can advance relevant scholarships. This study addresses these issues by analysing value co-creation through sustainable strategic alliance amongst commercial and not-for-profit organizations in Bangladesh. The research adopts qualitative method in the form of in-depth interviews from thirty-four senior management of commercial and not-for-profit organizations and industry experts in Bangladesh. Findings highlight the underlying drivers of strategic alliance that lead to value co-creation for concerned parties.

Crowdfunding networks are open, multisided markets that match founders and funders on crowdfunding platforms. The unique structure of these networks blends social and business networks and comprises a complex array of closer and more distant network relationships. Research investigating the characteristics of these open and highly dynamic network structures is in its infancy and capabilities critical to operating in them are under-explored. Thus, this study follows an abductive reasoning process to understand critical capabilities for influencing and orchestrating crowdfunding networks. It draws on a thematic content analysis of 1484 blog entries written by crowdfunding experts and a comprehensive review of (i) literature on crowdfunding networks and (ii) five literature streams dealing with dynamic capabilities in evolving network structures. As a substantial contribution, this research delineates a portfolio of four collaborative capabilities – visioning, dynamic business modelling, engaging, and attaining social continuity – essential for operating successfully in crowdfunding networks. These new collaborative capability sets assume a new understanding of agency as a continuum of managerial and collective agency, an understanding that is novel within the network management and the capabilities literature.}
