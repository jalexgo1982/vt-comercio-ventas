abstract = {Live streaming user-generated video (UGV), a nascent format of crowdsourced content, has grown massive popularity among social media users and is believed to have substantial potential business influences. However, industry practitioners express concerns regarding this new form on social media platforms and the influences of live streaming UGV consumption lack research. Motivated such, through a uniquely merged dataset from the video game industry, we conduct a series of panel time-series empirical analyses to investigate the business value of live streaming UGV consumption. Further, we propose a conceptual framework based on the sense of community literature to understand the consequences of live streaming UGV consumption and verify it through several online experiments. This research contributes to the IS literature by shedding light on the influences of emergent crowdsourced content, providing a conceptual framework to existing literature, and offering rich managerial implications and guidelines to managers regarding utilizing live streaming UGVs.}

abstract = {Greening, Digitizing and Redefining Aims in an Uncertain and Finite World: the triad facing the world in the immediate future as climate change, pandemic, digitization and the scramble for energy resources mark the challenges of an uncertain and finite world.
Purpose
Keeping in line with previous research on the social, commercial, and industrial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper has a dual objective: to extend the analysis in a common time frame by exploring additional indicators based on existing data sources and to analyse the relationships between EIDaD and R&D, comparing the pre- and post-COVID-19 scenarios.
Methodology
Numerous primary data sources within multiple available databases were studied, such as the EU dataset. These sources provide a range of indicators which, despite the scarcity of available literature, facilitate an empirical approach involving the quantitative analysis of the information they contain. A set of subsequent correlation analyses during Pre-COVID-19, COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 were elaborated in order to explore the possible relationships between selected variables.
Structure
Previous research has shown that the IDR dataset facilitates the identification of early indicators of EIDaD and the expansion of EIDaD-related early indicators to key business ratios. This in turn allows comparisons between EIDaD and R&D to offer additional insight into how organizations can change the approach of their R&D and investment initiatives from reactive to proactive.
Findings
This paper sheds light on how R&D investments impact EIDaD initiatives and strongly suggests that organizations rethink how they approach entrepreneurship, innovation, digitization and digital transformation, using early indicators to facilitate better long-term decisions.
Originality
This paper shows that certain pre-pandemic strategic activities, such as R&D investments, may have influenced the behaviour of businesses, customers and society during the pandemic, and how wealth and economic value can be generated in a post-pandemic environment in the framework of a new economic model.
Practical implications
Organizations that succeed during a pandemic will serve as leadership models for the next generation of businesses, shaping the future of society as a whole. When early R&D investments bring about changes in the metrics that influence the recovery from the impact of a pandemic, they enhance the growth that can create jobs and offer new business opportunities in the new digital context.}

abstract = {When talking about digital transformation, data sovereignty considerations and data transfers cannot be excluded from the discussion, given the considerable likelihood that digital technologies deployed along the process collect, process and transfer (personal) data in multiple jurisdictions. An increasing number of nations, especially those within the BRICS grouping (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are developing their data governance and digital transformation approaches based on data sovereignty considerations, deeming specific types of data as key strategic and economic resources, which deserve particular protection and that must be leveraged for national development. From this perspective, this paper will try to shed light on how data sovereignty and data transfers interplay in the context of digital transformations. Particularly, we will consider the various dimensions that compose the concept of data sovereignty and will utilise a range of examples from the BRICS grouping to back some of the key considerations developed with empirical evidence. We define data sovereignty as the capacity to understand how and why (personal) data are processed and by whom, develop data processing capabilities, and effectively regulate data processing, thus retaining self-determination and control. We have chosen the BRICS grouping for three reasons. First, research on the grouping's data policies and digital transformation is still minimal despite their leading role. Second, BRICS account for over 40 % of the global population, or 3.2 billion people (which can be seen as 3.2 billion “data subjects” or data producers, depending on perspective, thus making them key players in data governance and digital transformation. Third, the BRICS members have realised that digital transformation is essential for the future of their economies and societies and have shaped specific data governance visions which must be considered by other countries, especially from the global majority, to understand why data governance is instrumental to foster thriving digital environments.}

Entrepreneurs take many strategic decisions that have a significant bearing on the success of their e-commerce ventures. Two are particularly salient for our research: Is it better to start as a pure-click or open a physical store? To what extent should e-commerce ventures internationalize? We also wonder if it is worth reviewing the first annual accounts available. Grounding on organizational ecology theory, we develop a model hypothesizing that (1) the brick-and-click strategy favours survival; (2) internationalization favours survival; (3) firm size and financial health matter; (4) earnings management mediates the relationship between financial health and survival; and (5) the brick-and-click and internationalization strategies mediate the relationship between size and survival. The empirical study is performed by analysing seven years of data on 632 new e-commerce ventures using non-parametric means tests, a Cox regression, and a generalized structural equation model. The study tests the strategies followed by e-commerce entrepreneurs and firm characteristics that influence survival. We find that the risk of bankruptcy is 1.437 times greater for pure-click than for brick-and-click retailers, 2.778 times greater for local players than for internationalized firms, and 1.787 times greater for unprofitable firms than for profitable firms. Hence, it is worth analysing the financial statements provided by entrepreneurs; however, signs of earnings management should be checked. All these factors affect the probability of early bankruptcy as well as explain survival several years later.}

This paper investigates the strategies for adopting recommender systems by online retailers, introducing a theoretical model to assess whether both incumbent and new entrant retailers should adopt these systems. The model conducts a comparative analysis, factoring in consumers’ search costs and the strategic choices of competitors. It establishes equilibrium outcomes for four distinct scenarios, followed by an analysis of the interplay between the strategy selection decisions of the two types of retailers. The results show that if one retailer does not adopt the system, the other retailer should always adopt it. However, when one retailer has already implemented the system, the other retailer should only do so if the search cost is relatively low and the recommendation cost is high, but not when the search cost is moderate. Given two retailers’ strategies, we identify the requirements that form two equilibriums: both retailers adopting the system, or only the incumbent retailer adopting it. Furthermore, the recommendation levels and product prices are not necessarily in a monotonic relationship with the cost of the system.}

On one hand, internationalization allows retailers to access a wider range of markets, and on the other, digital channel expansion enhances customer reach and convenience within international markets. More specifically, we examine the relationship between retailer internationalization and performance (I-P relationship), and how this relationship is contingent upon the idiosyncrasies of retail sectors (i.e., grocery vs. non-grocery), digitalization, and their combined effects. Building on the liability of foreignness perspective, we first argue that the I-P relationship is U-shaped, because internationalizing retailers initially incur greater costs in their international expansion owing to their unfamiliarity with foreign markets, but as their foreign presence increases, they benefit from greater market power, experience, and scale economies. Then, we contend that as grocers suffer from higher levels of liability of foreignness due to increased requirements for host country embeddedness, non-grocers benefit more from internationalization with any gains and losses further amplified by digitalization. Hypotheses are tested against a panel of the 234 largest international retailers in the world over a 21-year period (1997–2017) and findings support the conjectures.}

Firstly, a web content retrieving system was developed to fetch publicly available customer data on a retailer's website, including demographic information (gender, age, location, etc.) and product information (name, price, date, etc.) of each purchase in a period from 2008 to 2019. The RFMT values of a customer were then computed from the retrieved data and subsequently analyzed by the hierarchical clustering to derive seven homogeneous clusters with specific customer profiles. Subsequently, demographic features and product preferences were identified for each cluster with business insights that can help the retailer to improve customer relationships and to implement targeted recommendation strategies.}

Drawing on the theory of perceived behavioral control, this study contributes to the literature by proposing a theoretical framework that links the pre-purchase search channel (i.e., social commerce vs traditional e-commerce) to purchase quantity. To test hypotheses, we utilize a large sample consisting of 279,098 pre-purchase click events of 6,721 products purchased by 247,069 consumers in March 2018. The empirical results suggest that purchase quantity is lower when a consumer searches through a social commerce channel compared to a traditional e-commerce channel.

This article proposes a new paradigm to deal with industrial and societal challenges, developing an auction-enabled collaborative routing mechanism for omnichannel on-demand logistics in a real-time transshipment network. We consider an online service platform for real-time management of on-demand pickup and delivery tasks, where multiple freight shippers can trade with multiple freight carriers. Freight shippers are retailers or individual customers, while freight carriers are a group of logistics service providers. The platform acts as the auctioneer. A two-stage combinational auction mechanism is designed for dynamic on-demand task (re)allocation. Tactical-level auctioning and operational-level routing decisions are optimized together. The transshipment-based task generation method is used to identify uneconomic paths from carrier’s real-time network for outsourcing. A transshipment-based routing algorithm is developed to enable each carrier to make decentralized decisions for network reconstruction and transportation bidding. Our model aims to improve the overall social welfare while bringing benefits to stakeholders involved. The computational results have shown positive society impacts. Specifically, shippers’ payments can be saved while carriers’ profits are increased compared with other operative models which have been investigated in previous research studies or industry. In addition, a substantial reduction in CO2 emissions and vehicles required can be achieved. The main reason for the improvement in social welfare is due to the optimal network achieved through collaboration. We also numerically analyze the impacts of three key factors: growth in demand density, urgency of tasks and flexible auction interval.}

abstract = {Lazada is one of the famous online e-commerce platforms in Southeast Asia. Even though it is the same organization, but the operation, and mechanism in every country is not 100% the same, because it will localize the user experiences and user interface for every country. In this study, Malaysia and Thailand is chosen to determine if the localization of user experience and user interface will affect on the security mechanism. Due to the large amount of online transaction, it is needed to have a strong security mechanism to protect the users from the internet hackers and scam. Hence, in this research, the security mechanism from users’ perspective will be studied. The most used security constructs such as Transaction Procedure, Technical Protection, Security Statements, Perceived Security and Perceived Trust are studied to identify the difference in the extent of the electronic payment system (EPS) used in Lazada between Malaysian and Thai users. Quantitative research method is applied with total of 250 samples collected from Malaysian and Thai users. The collected data is analysed through SPSS with Pearson Correlation Analysis to determine the hypothesis. The results of the data analysis indicate that Malaysians and Thais have different perceptions of the security mechanisms on Lazada, with Malaysians placing greater emphasis on Security Statements and Technical Protection and Thais on Security Statements and Perceived Trust. It proved that the localization of user interface and user experiences from the perspective of security mechanism will bring different perspectives for the users.}

abstract = {Machine learning and data mining techniques have been used extensively in order to detect credit card frauds. However, most studies consider credit card transactions as isolated events and not as a sequence of transactions. In this framework, we model a sequence of credit card transactions from three different perspectives, namely (i) The sequence contains or doesn’t contain a fraud (ii) The sequence is obtained by fixing the card-holder or the payment terminal (iii) It is a sequence of spent amount or of elapsed time between the current and previous transactions. Combinations of the three binary perspectives give eight sets of sequences from the (training) set of transactions. Each one of these sequences is modelled with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Each HMM associates a likelihood to a transaction given its sequence of previous transactions. These likelihoods are used as additional features in a Random Forest classifier for fraud detection. Our multiple perspectives HMM-based approach offers automated feature engineering to model temporal correlations so as to improve the effectiveness of the classification task and allows for an increase in the detection of fraudulent transactions when combined with the state of the art expert based feature engineering strategy for credit card fraud detection. In extension to previous works, we show that this approach goes beyond ecommerce transactions and provides a robust feature engineering over different datasets, hyperparameters and classifiers. Moreover, we compare strategies to deal with structural missing values.}

abstract = {No one can cast a shadow on the fact that returning a product is an integral part of any online retailing business. Thus, a well-designed return policy plays a pivotal role. This paper suggests a new formulation for the utility function applying to return policies enjoying product exchange scenarios. To use this proposed model, we extract four scenarios from some policies like time lenient return policy; monetary lenient return policy; exchange; and appeasement, which is paid during an out-of-stock that may occur when the customer returns the product. We consider a ratio that measures the effect of returning time duration on customer satisfaction to demonstrate the importance of the time leniency policy. Besides, we implement three notations to calculate the value of appeasement (financial compensation), taking place when an Out-Of-Stock happens in the process of returning the product. Models were formulated for an online retailing platform, including a retailer; an online marketplace; and a customer. After solving all mathematical models, formulated as a two-staged game theory, we extract that the profit of the online marketplace is twice more than the retailer in all scenarios, regardless of the value of the parameters. In addition, as we have considered the partial money-back guarantee in the fourth scenario, the results show that the value of the partial money-back guarantee has no impact on the profit of both the retailer and the marketplace since the price neutralizes this impact. Moreover, we have found out that the profit value of the retailer when he faces out-of-stock and chooses to pay financial compensation to the customer is so tight compared to the scenario in which he decides to supply the product. We illustrate the figures and depict that there are parameters that can make a difference rather than the scenario only.}

We develop a stylized model where a manufacturer distributes products through two separate retailers in two market segments, e.g., online vs. offline. The aim of this study is to investigate the impacts of competing retailers’ omnichannel moves on supply chain performance. Our model combines pricing interactions and channel move strategies from a supply-side perspective. We obtain three main results. First, though it is suitable for the traditional brick-and-mortar retailer to adopt an omnichannel strategy, it may not be always good for the e-tailer. Second, omnichannel retail does not always lead to lower retail prices and enhanced consumer welfare. It may result in a lower price for the offline segment, but for the online segment, a higher price will be charged. Finally, omnichannel retail may not be good for the manufacturer. An equilibrium {Omnichannel, Digital channel only} strategy outcome of the retailers’ channel move game results in a higher demand and more profits for the manufacturer. However, the manufacturer is indeed hurt by the {Omnichannel, Omnichannel} equilibrium. Our study provides useful managerial insights into retailers’ omnichannel moves in a supply chain.}

To tackle this, we propose a novel framework called Explainable Attribute-augmented Neural framework (EAN), which integrates comprehensive attribute and visual data, enabling explainability in fashion product compatibility modeling. We conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and explainability of our proposed framework. The practical significance of our research is twofold. Firstly, it helps consumers understand the underlying reasons for fashion item pairings, thereby assisting them in refining their dressing combinations. Secondly, it provides novel perspectives for product design and assists e-commerce platforms in creating more effective product marketing combinations.}

To address this issue, we propose a methodology that represents heterogeneous organization data in a high-level space by combining them into single ontology represented by knowledge graph. The graph is constructed autonomously using semi-structured data from various sources. Our method identifies links between sources based on several similar metric between keys sets of each collection. Then document collections are combined into merged entities if collections’ key sets are similar. The experiments demonstrate the applicability of the developed approach for constructing a knowledge graph based on partially structured data from various sources, performing with high F1 measure (0.8 on average) when compared to the expert markup.}

Although there has been some research in this field, accurately identifying the target still remains problematic especially when the target of mockery is not presented in the text. In this paper, we propose a combination of a machine learning classifier and a deep learning model to extract the target of sarcasm from the text. First, we classify sarcastic sentences using machine learning, to determine whether a sarcastic sentence contains a target. Then we use a deep learning model from Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis to extract the target. Our proposed system is evaluated on three publicly available data sets: sarcastic book snippets, sarcastic tweets, and sarcastic Reddit comments. Our evaluation results show that our approach achieves equal or better performance compared to the current state-of-the-art system, with an 18% improvement on the Reddit data set and similar scores on the Books and Tweets data sets. This is because our method is able to accurately identify when the target of sarcasm is not present. The primary challenge we identify, that is hindering the creation of a high accuracy classifier, is the lack of consistency among human annotators in identifying the target of sarcasm within standard ground-truth data sets.}

More importantly, this study provides strong evidence that the effects of live streamers' competencies on online sales are contingent on product type and competitiveness. Specifically, live streamers' cognitive and emotional competencies have a more salient impact on experience product sales than search products.

To help keep retailer’s store open and improve its competitiveness, many stores at present incorporate the “buy online, pick up in-store” (BOPS) service. This has given rise to new challenges in deciding how to allocate the limited store shelf-spaces to meet both store and BOPS demands. Our optimal decisions of product order-quantity and inventory-allocation for meeting dual-channel demands include constraints on probability in satisfying in-store demands and limitation of total inventory-space. This study develops four models representing the traditional situation without the BOPS service: benchmark model; separated inventory and separated order for two channels; joint inventory but separated order for two channels; and joint inventory and joint order for two channels. Extensive single- and multiple-variable experiments explores impact of changing model-parameter values (e.g., BOPS demand, cross selling effect) to expected total profits and optimal order-quantities. Conditions of which model leads to larger profits are discussed.}

To simultaneously capture the time-aware demands and time-invariant interests of e-commerce customers, this study proposes a unique heterogeneous graph structure to model sequential buying order and rating feedback and develops a query-based recommendation approach to predict future purchase behavior. Experiments on four different datasets show that the approach demonstrates improved performance for different metrics.}

Using surprise- and uncertainty-related theories, this exploratory study considers the effects of a gambled price discount (GPD), which is a price promotion that involves discount uncertainty, on consumers' perception of the replenishment and curation of a subscription package. Partial least squares (PLS) and PLS multi-group analyses reveal that the perceived attractiveness of GPD adds to the enjoyment of a subscription package. GPD's usefulness as a price promotion tactic is particularly evident when used under the replenishment mode. The positive aspect of the bivalent nature of surprise as an emotion is particularly evident for the replenishment subscription.}

Using metrics such as precision at 10 documents (P@10), others have already shown that the quality of deterministically sorted results is lower than that of best-match (or relevance) sorted results, and that work is needed in order to improve result quality. But metrics such as P@10 are based purely on relevance, and do not reflect the order-feature: cost (be it price, time, or otherwise) — and it is hard to see how to improve a system without a metric that reflects the quality of the ordering. In this contribution we introduce a set of metrics that, using relevance and cost, measure the quality of deterministically sorted search engine results. We examine metrics from the perspective of the buyer, the seller, and the systems engineer. Using our new metrics (buying power (bp), buying power for K (bp4k), selling power (sp), and cheapest precision (Pc)) we re-evaluate the results of the “eBay SIGIR 2019 eCommerce Search Challenge: High Accuracy Recall Task” and demonstrate how to include cost in a metric designed to evaluate the quality of deterministically ordered lists of results.}

Our approach involves the generation of labels for both aspects and sentiments, employing the Snorkel framework of WSL, which incorporates aspect terms, review sentiment scores, and review ratings as sources of weak signals. This innovative strategy significantly reduces the laborious labeling efforts required for processing such extensive datasets. In this study, we deployed hybrid models, namely BiLSTM, CNN-BiLSTM, and CNN-LSTM, which harness multiple inputs, including review text, aspect terms, and ratings. Our proposed model employs two distinct loss functions: Binary Cross Entropy with Sigmoid Activation for Multi-Label Classification, enabling us to learn aspect Labels such as Quality, Usability, Service, Size, and Price, and Categorical Cross Entropy with Softmax Activations for Multi-Class Classification. Subsequently, we meticulously evaluate the performance metrics of these three implemented models, including Macro F1 score and Macro Precision. CNN & Bi-LSTM model attained 0.78 and 0.79 F1 scores on aspect and sentiment identification, respectively. The outcomes of this research are poised to make a substantial contribution to e-commerce platforms, offering an efficient and automated means to label and analyze vast troves of user reviews.}

Prior literature has identified the promising potential to help alleviate conventional business logistics' sustainability concerns, and researchers have advocated the need for extensive research for the future development of CL. However, the domain still lacks a developmental framework that explicitly studies factors affecting CL development and provides a roadmap for further growth. This study systematically reviews a portfolio of seventy-nine articles using the quantitative content analysis technique to identify the temporal trends in CL literature and collates lists of 11 barriers, 11 drivers, and 10 enablers to CL development. Following the systematic literature review, this study appraises the barriers, drivers, and enablers using content analysis and proposes a preliminary framework for CL development. At the theoretical level, we propose a developmental framework and supplement it with relevant recommendations for operationalization and testing, followed by several research questions to open avenues for future research. At a managerial level, our study helps practitioners with suggestions to adapt the proposed framework for CL businesses to foster sustainable CL systems.

Building on a unique data set covering all proximity-store openings in 60+ geographic markets in France by Carrefour, one of the world's largest big-box grocery retailers, the authors adopt an Empirics-First approach to investigate whether, and in what settings, opening proximity stores cannibalizes, or rather acts synergistically with, the retail chain's existing on- and off-line operations. In most markets, small box stores affect the parent store's market position. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in terms of both the channel that is affected (off- or online) and the direction of that impact (positive or negative). The authors identify several contingency factors that help explain this heterogeneity. Interestingly, some location factors that are commonly believed to nurture proximity store appeal turn out to be detrimental to the chain's overall on- and/or offline performance. Even though the authors reveal several novel insights and identify various contingency factors, numerous questions remain unanswered. To that extent, the authors conclude with a research agenda that may help shed insight in how to maintain and strengthen brick-and-mortar store relevance to convenience-seeking customers.}

Reconfigurable process planning (RPP) reconstructs the optimal process planning for each batch according to different part batches based on commonality. In combination with the optimal crowdsourcing contracting (OCC) strategy, RPP helps release fixed capital and increase the flexibility of the enterprise under the requirement of diversified parts. The coupling of process planning and crowdsourcing contracting decisions is inherent in open manufacturing. This paper focuses on coordinated optimization underlying OCC with RPP. An OCC decision-making mechanism considering RPP based on Stackelberg game theory is established, which provides a solution for trade-offs between the RPP decision-maker and the OCC decision-maker. A coordinated optimization model is proposed to reveal the hierarchical relationships and is solved by a nesting genetic algorithm. A case study of a group of rotating shaft parts is taken to illustrate the effectiveness of the bilevel coordinated optimization (BCO) model. The results present that the commonality has an apparent impact on the OCC and RPP decisions in open manufacturing, and integrating it into process planning activities is advisable for platform enterprises to increase production efficiency and competitive advantages. Our proposed model can deal with the conflict and coordination between OCC and RPP and balances the benefits of platform enterprise with the optimal contractor impacts triggered by planning activities.}

This research paper presents a robust system that harnesses the Ethereum blockchain, IPFS (Interplanetary File System), and advanced cryptographic algorithms to create a secure, decentralized approach for tracking goods and preventing theft incidents. Unique identifiers and related information will be sent to the mail of the customer and same should entered by the customer for successful transaction. By assigning unique identifiers to purchased products and employing cryptographic techniques to encrypt sensitive data, our system ensures both user privacy and the creation of an immutable transaction ledger. Users can efficiently manage their purchased goods, block stolen items, and communicate with sellers through an intuitive interface. Additionally, the system provides sellers with a comprehensive transaction history, enhancing accountability and transparency within the supply chain. Through this research, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our blockchain based anti-theft measures, underpinned by Ethereum, IPFS, and cutting-edge cryptographic algorithms, in fostering secure, trustless transactions.

The advent of smartphones and other handheld devices has given rise to web users consulting websites with more than one device, or using a shared device. As a result, large volumes of seemingly disjoint data are available, which when analysed together can support decision-making. The task of identifying web sessions by linking such data back to a specific person, however, is hard. The idea of session stitching aims to overcome this by using machine learning inference to identify similar or identical users. Many such efforts use various demographic data or device-based features to train matching algorithms. However, often these variables are not available for every dataset or are recorded differently, making a streamlined setup difficult. Besides, they often result in vast feature spaces which are hard to use for actionable interpretation. In this paper, we present an alternative approach based on the fingerprinting of web pages visited by users in a single session. By learning behavioural patterns from these sequences of page visits, we obtain features that can be used for matching without requiring sensitive user-agent data such as IP, geo location, or device details as is common with other approaches. Using these sequential fingerprints does not rely on pre-defined features, but only requires the recording of web page visits, making our approach actionable. The approach is empirically tested on real-life web logs and compared with matching using regular user-agent features and state-of-the-art embedding techniques. Results in an ecommerce context show sequential features can still obtain strong performance with fewer features, facilitating decision-making on session stitching and inform subsequent related activities such as marketing or customer analysis.}

This study attempts to develop a deeper understanding of the reasons underlying seller resistance to the DDRP. Grounded in the innovation resistance theory (IRT), the research model of this study is validated using data collected from 307 Chinese potential sellers of used digital devices. Using the structural equation modeling techniques, this study reveals that perceived security and privacy risk, attitudes toward sustainability, and negative word-of-mouth have a significant impact on seller resistance to DDRP. Finally, the control variable, education, negatively affects seller resistance. These findings not only offer important theoretical contributions to green IT research but also provide guidance to DDRP operators for formulating strategies to reduce seller resistance.}

Although many studies have investigated consumers’ purchase decisions regarding sustainable products, little research has addressed SSCCs and the relationship between privacy, disclosure intentions, and purchase intentions in SSCCs. These relationships are important because the use of smart technology products requires large volumes of consumers’ personal information, which can lead to severe privacy issues when adopting SSCCs. Accordingly, consumers’ preferences for features of sustainable products could conflict with their privacy concerns when they disclose personal information. Thus, we investigate the relationship between the several benefits of SSCCs and privacy-related decisions when purchasing SSCCs. We propose an extended privacy trade-off model based on three critical assumptions: two types of privacy trade-offs, bidirectional privacy reduction, and anchoring effects. We also investigate the effects of government subsidies for purchasing SSCCs regarding the relationship between governments, companies, and consumers. To validate our model, we test the effects of interaction between privacy concerns and the benefits of SSCCs on disclosure intentions and purchase intentions. Our repeated tests for the various benefits of SSCCs demonstrate the robustness of the model. Our results indicate that when consumers consider purchasing SSCCs, sustainability plays the role of the common good in trading for privacy concerns. In addition, government subsidies to encourage companies’ sustainable products increase disclosure intentions and purchase intentions. We conclude that the status of sustainability as a common goal among governments, companies, and consumers represents an opportunity to balance the privacy tensions in the sale and purchase of SSCCs.}

For each study, the hypotheses of the effects of an instant refund on consumer responses were discussed, and a one-factor (instant refund service, yes vs. no) between-subject scenario experiment (with an additional related experiment in study 1) was conducted, using online panel data from Wjx.cn. One-way ANOVA was used to test the hypotheses. It is concluded that an instant refund service increases consumer satisfaction with the experience and improves other consumer responses. In terms of potential side-effects, instant refunds are not significantly associated with stronger product return intentions. These findings can help online sellers decide whether to evolve their conventional refund mode to a new instant refund mode.}

Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to investigate the differences in the perceived influence of brand-owned touchpoints on differing managerial and departmental levels and their implications on effective company resource alignment and goal fulfillment. We conclude that differences in perceived influence of brand-owned touchpoints on brand perceptions are present on all managerial and departmental levels and thus not only need to be acknowledged by managers but also need to be harmonized to ensure an effective resource alignment and goal fulfillment.}

To master this shift, firms have to take the platformization pathway, which describes the process when manufacturers turn into digital platform providers. However, little is known about platformization on the firm level from a transformation perspective. Our study attempts to close this gap and develops a transformation model that frames the platformization pathway when established manufacturers become platform leaders. For this purpose, we adopt the concept of ambidexterity and develop a theoretical framework to conceptualize and investigate the transformation process as a result of sequential transitions and balancing between explorative and exploitative activities. Moreover, we use interviews from 29 large manufacturers and conduct an inductive case study analysis to identify the different stages, the contextual factors and the dynamics of transformation. By combining the theoretical framework and the results of our case study analysis, we develop a formal transformation model that contributes to understanding the manufacturers' platformization pathway. Our results also aim to support manufacturers in designing their strategies so they can turn into leading digital platform providers.}

This paper proposes a hybrid model to incorporate taxonomy and folksonomy information to enhance ecommerce recommendations. It first develops a tree matching algorithm to establish the overall similarity between items, where tag information is integrated for semantic analysis for taxonomy attributes. Next, it proposes a unique random walk model on a heterogeneous graph constructed by user nodes and item nodes and different types of relations — user–item preference and item–item similarity relations. The random walk model is designed to be effective to identify the nearest item nodes for a particular user node, which are seen as the best-fit items for recommendations. Empirical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model improves performance in terms of both recommendation coverage and accuracy, especially for sparse data.}

These measures include opening a self-run livestream channel and allowing online consumers to buy-online-and-return-in-store (BORS). In practice, there are remarkable heterogeneities between the two strategies: Some retailers provide one or both strategies, while others do not. Furthermore, it is unclear how the introduction of a self-run livestream channel will impact a retailer's adoption of BORS. This paper develops a theoretical model to investigate a retailer’s optimal decisions on adopting a self-run livestream selling or BORS service. By comparing the retailer’s equilibrium profits under four strategies, we identify the conditions for adopting each strategy. The retailer’s optimal strategies mainly depend on the in-store return handling cost and the face value of the coupon in the self-run livestream channel. Furthermore, we find a counterintuitive result that if consumers are offered a relatively high coupon, the introduction of a self-run livestream channel reduces the threshold for the retailer to provide BORS service. We extend the model by considering an endogenous coupon face value and find the main results are still valid.}

In view of EC importance in global business transactions, surprisingly, there is no proper and appropriate system of performance measurement. Even if an EC firm were to measure performance, typically, the focus is on financial results using the traditional accounting system (AS) of measurement. The aim of this paper is to identify the metrics and indicators needed for EC performance measurement as the AS is inappropriate for many of the EC activities such as traffic flow, reliability of security of online payments, use of social-media data, etc. We first use a systematic analysis of selected articles to help us identify, understand and select metrics and indicators that are applicable for EC performance measurement. The Delphi method is then undertaken to conduct a questionnaire survey to gauge consensus of experts’ opinions with respect to (wrt) the use of those metrics and indicators selected. We found the respondents largely agreed that the metrics and indicators proposed by us are necessary or very necessary for use in EC performance measurement, although the experts consider three of the metrics proposed − traffic sources, emails subscribers and customer lifetime value be replaced with three accounting indicators (net income, return on investment and break-even points). The data is robust as it is verified by statistical tests. This study has both academic and practical implications; for the former, the metrics and indicators proposed meet the theoretical mathematical measurement system, and for the latter, the metrics and indicators proposed allows operation and strategic managers to design and develop an organization’s PMS.}

A new technological mix of mobile-apps, big data, blockchain, AI, cloud computing and digital platforms is taking place with unprecedented speed and is forcing traditional banks to consider this technology to form part of new collaborative value creation networks, such as digital business ecosystems (DBEs). Traditional payment habits based on cash and credit or debit cards are being replaced by new innovative formats of mobile instant payment among end users (P2P). Through a single case study – Bizum's DBE – the purpose of this research is to explore how successful was the defensive strategy developed by traditional banking entities with the objective to lead the new mobile instant payment ecosystem in Spain. The findings show that Bizum's DBE is helping traditional banking entities to create a superior digital value that is being adopted very quickly by a huge number of users in Spain. The main contribution of this study is the complete explanation of how a winning strategy of creation and development of a DBE can: i) ensure survival of incumbents in the face of threats from digital disruptive actors, and ii) transform consumer habits very quickly, due to the superior created value as a new solution for that need. We used the novel reformulation of the Modularity Theory (Baldwin, 2020c) which can be considered as a first step for a DBE-specific theorisation and supportive framework to understand the deep social impact of the different network effects generated.}

Notably, the e-commerce industry is known for relying heavily on big data analytics, business intelligence, and other data-related technologies. Multiple semi-structured interviews with e-commerce professionals and consumers were conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of GDPR based on the strategies employed by e-commerce companies and the online user experience of customers in the Netherlands. The main findings show that while GDPR compliance incurred additional costs for companies, it also improved data security and increased customer trust. Furthermore, the results also suggest that GDPR affects the e-commerce analytics operations in organizations after its adoption. Thus, many organizations have altered their practices to achieve compliance with the laws. The findings of this research contribute to the ongoing exploration of the effects of GDPR on online retail businesses that utilize (big) data analytics.}

However, the majority of the products on e-commerce portals do not have any ratings or reviews and are known as cold products (∼90% of products on Amazon are cold). As such, there has been growing interest in generating reviews for cold products by selectively transferring reviews from other similar yet warm products. Our work in this paper focuses on this specific problem and generates reviews for cold products through review selection. Similar to existing work in the literature, our work assumes a relationship between product attribute-values and the reviews that products receive. However, unlike the literature, our method (1) is not restricted to the exact surface form of a product attribute name; and, (2) can distinguish between the same attribute expressed in different forms. We achieve these two important characteristics by proposing methods to learn neural product representations that capture the semantics of product attribute-values as they relate to user reviews. More specifically, our work offers (i) an approach to learn neural representations of product attribute-values within a shared embedding space as product reviews; (ii) a weighted composition strategy to develop product representations from the representation of its attributes; and, (iii) a review selection method that selects relevant reviews for the composed product representation within the neural embedding space. We show through our extensive experiments on five datasets consisting of products from CNET.com and movies from rottentomatoes.com that our method is able to show stronger performance compared to several baselines on ROUGE-2 metrics.}

The platform enables the shift from the traditional manufacturing process, which is driven by research and marketing, toward a customer-centric product development process. However, a challenge arises as customers lack technical knowledge to communicate their product specifications effectively, creating a semantic gap. This paper proposes a soft prompt-based network structure that utilizes pretrained language models to bridge the semantic gap on the C2M platform. To address limited customer needs data and imbalanced classes, a large corpus of product review texts is used to establish a mapping between reviews and product specifications. A smaller set of customer needs text is then employed to adapt this mapping to the target customer needs-product specifications relationship, thereby closing the semantic gap. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model adaptation operation and the prompting structure. Additionally, the experiments highlight the robustness of the proposed method against variations in training data size, thereby mitigating the challenges posed by imbalanced classes. The proposed method could potentially bring innovation to product customization and C2M platform development. By bridging the semantic gap, companies can better integrate customers in the co-design process and effectively translate customer needs into actionable product specifications.}

Upon which we propose a theoretical model of bilateral negotiation as the framework for designing the SLR model. We then propose the testable hypotheses to evaluate the utility of the proposed model against the benchmark results. We build a prototype system and empirically test the hypotheses using computer-to-computer (CtC) and human-to-computer (HtC) negotiation experiments. The empirical results show that the proposed system outperforms the benchmark system in both CtC and HtC negotiations regarding deal price and utility. The proposed model provides an automated negotiation solution for online platforms that can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their negotiation capability.}

However, simply materializing of ICT4D projects is not enough for minimizing the prevalent digital divide in rural areas in developing countries. For the success of an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) intervention, it is important to consider the capabilities of users, who are responsible for converting ICT resources into outcome. While most of the ICT-related studies are focused on the adoption of actual technologies and influences of different internal and external factors on intervention outcomes, very few studies are focused on evaluating intervention outcomes and redesigning intervention strategies. In this study, I opted for using a conceptual framework following the Capability Approach that simultaneously identifies the influence factors for intervention outcome as well as evaluates the outcome based on Noble Laureate Amartya Sen’s five freedoms concept. A qualitative technique has been chosen to conduct the study. As part of the impact evaluation of an ICT4D intervention, a project known as Union Digital Centres (UDCs) in Bangladesh was selected. A total of ten themes are identified indicating that the outcome of the intervention is contributing to socio-economic and human development. However, the study has revealed that lack of capabilities of users (e.g. prior knowledge and financial inability) bar the UDC programs to fulfill their goals at highest level. This study would practically help the UDC policy makers to adjust the UDC intervention design by addressing the shortcomings of the users to yield higher UDC program outcome. Additionally, this study theoretically contributes in ICT adoption literature by showing that there is a mutual influence between users’ capabilities and ICT-related project outcomes. Finally, using specific case study (ICT4D project in Bangladesh), this study contextualizes Amartya Sen’s five freedoms concept in the ICT-specific context.}

In this paper, we propose a novel method based on graph Laplacian eigenmaps for predicting the geographic location of nodes in complex networks. Our method utilizes the adjacency matrix of the network and generates a scoring matrix that captures the similarity between nodes in terms of their geographic location. By transforming the distance matrices into score matrices using exponential decay, we show that the method achieves consistently high performance across various real-world datasets, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments on real-world networks demonstrate that The LCG method proposed in this study exhibits consistently high performance across most of the evaluated datasets, with an average score of 0.95%, surpassing the other methods.}

abstract = {Deep learning models have demonstrated outstanding forecasting effects and are extensively used in forecasting problems in numerous scenarios. The Long short-term memory neural network (LSTM), a deep learning variant, has huge potential in forecasting the forthcoming values of given patterns using historical time series data. Lately, the forecasting task has captivated the focus of researchers in deep learning areas to handle the constraints of traditional statistical approaches. Owing to the dire need for accurate forecasting and also due to technological advancements, the collection of time series data has become more accessible, and this has paved the way for deep forecasting models. In this paper, we propose the Stacked Bi-LSTM (SBiLSTM) architecture, an adaptation of the traditional deep long-short term memory (TDLM). The approach is evaluated using two oilfield production time series. The performance of the proposed SBiLSTM model is compared with the recurrent neural network-RNNs, multi-layer RNNs, deep gated recurrent unit (DGRU), and deep long-short term memory (DLSTM). Using different measurement criteria, the empirical results show that the proposed DLSTM model outperforms other standard approaches. It is observed that the proposed SBiLSTM model acquires long and short-range interdependent features of univariate time series data without the large memory requirement.}

Key differences between a traditional and an F-Warehouse are (i) a very large number of small storage bins, (iii) an explosive storage policy that disperses inventory of each item to multiple bins, and (iii) commingled bin storage. The paper introduces the explosive storage picking problem, which is a special case of the traditional order picking problem. Since they stock items in multiple locations, there are multiple picking options for each item. A picklist for several items is generated from the current inventory dispersion and the objective is to minimize the picklist bin range. The problem is first formulated as an MIP and then three fast solutions, SpaceX MIP, H1, and H2 are presented. The H1 and H2 seed heuristics use weighted bin order fillability, as a surrogate for the probability a seed bin will generate short picklists. For small problems, SpaceX MIP found the optimal solution. Larger problems compared H1 and H2 with the SpaceX MIP solutions. On average, the H1 solution was 34% longer while the H2 solution was only 18% longer. The H1+2 strategy selects the shorter of the two solutions. For 62% of problems, H1+2 matched the SpaceX solution, and for only 17% of problems, the solution was worse than 20%. We tested H1+2 on an F-Warehouse simulator and it achieved 40% faster fulfillment relative to the benchmark.}

In the current study we investigated the association between brain activities and consumers’ behaviour. Additionally, we investigated whether pre-trained Python models for sentiment analyses predict consumer behaviour and assessed it's association with brain activities during decision-making tasks. Neural and behavioral responses of participants used for analysis of their decision making processes when choosing their product of interest. This has been accomplished while the participants’ brain activities were recorded at pre-test (baseline) and during each decision-making tasks. Results of this study revealed significant association between certain resting-state EEG power spectral densities and consumer decisions. Moreover, sentiment analysis models showed good accuracy in predicting product like/disliking. These findings demonstrates the potential of combination of neuroscience and sentiment analysis methods in consumers’ behaviour research especially for agile product development processes.}

Therefore, this study introduces a novel, multi-method approach that utilizes combined data-collection and data-analyses procedures that help retailers to identify and meaningfully cluster relevant touchpoints along the customer journey. Results indicate, among others, that retailers can benefit from abandoning the classic, within-company perspective and cluster their touchpoints according to the customers’ perspective. Furthermore, our approach enables retailers to infer the most important sales-influencing touchpoints.

In the markets where complex interactions between competitors, search intermediaries and consumers create a network, B2B relationships can be inferred from consumer search patterns, and can then be modeled to gauge the online performance. A commercial dataset from ComScore’s US panel of one million users is used to illustrate a new approach to measure and evaluate the online performance of competitors in the US airline market. The methodology and associated performance framework demonstrate the potential for new forms of market intelligence based on the visualization of market networks, online performance calculated from matrix algorithms, the measurement of the impact of search intermediaries, and the identification of latent relationships. This research makes theoretical and empirical contributions to the debate on the use of big data for B2B market analytics. B2B managers can use this approach to extend their network horizon from an egocentric to a network view of competition and map out their competitive landscape from the perspective of the customer.}

Through this article, we analyzed the main areas of improvement for RFID solution, such it does not cover the picking area; unlike in gross storage areas where every palette may contain an RFID Tag in permanent communication with ERP/WMS. However, in the retail area the products are not tracked (possibly but expensive), leaving low visibility on real-time inventory behind with the risk of inventory shortage for items already ordered by customers on the e-commerce platform or excess inventory. The solution we proposed covers this flaw, by creating smart picking areas, based on weighing to get primary data to be quantified. This solution increases inventory reliability and responsivity by helping the retail areas resupply and mastering the picking and preparation delays.}

Our study extends this line of research by newly identifying and incorporating three predictors of B2C ecommerce success’s system-quality dimension: the formatting quality (FQ), picture quality (PQ), and third-party seal (TPS) user-interface-design factors (UIDFs). Given the uncertainty associated with online shopping, we also incorporated uncertainty avoidance’s moderating influence on B2C ecommerce success as one of Hoftstede’s national culture dimensions. Motivated by cross-cultural research suggesting that behavioral models often do not hold across different cultures, we tested our model using a sample of 768 B2C consumers from Kuwait, Poland, and Latvia. These countries represent three distinct and understudied national cultures: the Arab world, Central Europe, and Eastern Europe. Our results support our newly hypothesized model, suggesting that both picture quality and formatting positively affect system quality, while—surprisingly—TPSs do not. We also found that uncertainty avoidance moderates the relationship between user satisfaction and reuse intentions but not the relationship between perceived value and reuse intentions. Finally, we found that our newly expanded model is robust across the three national cultures we explored; therefore, it can explain reuse intentions in distinct cultures and a B2C ecommerce context. This study’s findings present important implications for practitioners and researchers who seek to understand and improve B2C ecommerce success across distinct national cultures.}

Online platforms provide some advantages to consumers such as product variety, deals on prices and mitigate geographical barriers. Nevertheless, existing auction platforms are centralized and depend on third-party intermediaries for transaction settlement. As a result, online platforms raise critical concerns regarding data integrity, security, transparency, and traceability as potential bidders have to trust the organizer for legitimacy of bids. Thus, adopting a decentralized approach using blockchain technology can transform the auction process, eliminating intermediaries, ensure transparency and reduce transaction costs. In this paper, we propose a general framework for decentralized auctions leveraging (i) Ethereum smart contracts to trace and track bids, (ii) decentralized storage systems to upload documents related to bidding and (iii) trusted timer oracles that act as gateway between smart contract and external data feeds. In the proposed solution, we develop detailed algorithms that define the working principles of the Smart contract for the auction process. We present detailed cost analysis of the solution to demonstrate economic feasibility, providing a secure, transparent and reliable approach to online auctions.}

The date collected from Sarawakians served as the foundation for this study. Data from 130 individuals residing in Sarawak was collected through e-survey, employing a quantitative research method. The findings indicate that the sustainability of an eCommerce platform in Sarawak is influenced by the extent to which it aids users in achieving their objectives. Additionally, the Sarawak community's awareness of the advantages and risks associated with using eCommerce platforms was identified as another factor impacting platform sustainability.

However, very little is known about the metaverse from a customer, retailer, or brand perspective. This article summarizes how the metaverse has been conceptualized thus far in the literature and the popular press. The authors offer a new conceptualization of the metaverse that contains four distinct dimensions: online collaboration, high consumer immersion, unique digital assets, and digital personas. Considering that the technologies currently used to provide high consumer immersion (e.g., augmented reality, virtual reality) and unique digital assets (e.g., blockchain technology) are not fully developed or commercialized, the authors also propose the concept of a transitory metaverse to understand the current stage of metaverse development better. The authors conclude by providing 27 directions for future research based on a full factorial of how the metaverse dimensions amplify three customer touchpoints in the digital experience (digital economic exchange, complex social relationships, direct environment interaction) for the three main stakeholders of any retailing exchange (consumers, retailers, brands) along the entire customer journey (pre-purchase, purchase, post-purchase).}

By combining deep learning and econometric analysis on a livestreaming dataset consisting of 915 livestreaming events across 14 industry categories from a B2B commerce platform, this study specifically examines the impact of three speech acts (i.e., assertive, expressive, and directive speech acts) on sales performance. We first extract three speech acts by combining Word2Vec and Bi-GRU network with Attention Mechanism (WBA), then use econometric models to examine the effect of the streamer's speech acts on sales performance, and finally explore the moderating roles of product-level factors (i.e., product novelty and product category). The results show that the assertive and directive acts have a positive effect on sales performance, but the expressive acts have a negative effect on the sales performance. In addition, this study also provides strong evidence that the effects of these speech acts on sales performance are highly dependent on the novelty of the live product. This moderating effect is particularly significant for sensory products.}

We leveraged machine learning and deep learning algorithms to evaluate the visual complexity and coherence of the B2B livestream studio setting. We then developed the econometric model to determine how these factors affect sales during livestreaming events. Our analysis drew on a dataset of 954 B2B livestreaming events across 8 industry categories. Our study highlights the adverse effects of visual complexity and coherence on sales performance. Notably, high-involvement products are found to be more affected by visual complexity and coherence compared to low-involvement products.}

The current research was conducted to investigate the effect of LSM on review helpfulness, and to introduce perceived credibility as the psychological mechanism that explains the effect. The findings from three experimental studies have shown that perceived credibility explains the positive effect of LSM on review helpfulness. Moreover, consumers find that reviews with high LSM are more helpful and credible when experts rather than peers provide the reviews. This research contributes to the literature on LSM and the helpfulness of reviews by showing how congruency in the language of the review provided by experts increases the reviews' appeal and offers practical suggestions for managers and marketers to better manage their product and service reviews.}

Recommender systems, which sift through enormous amounts of dynamically generated data to give consumers with personalised information and services, are able to overcome this problem. Bipartite graphs are currently generally used to store and understand this data due to its sparse nature. Data are mapped to a bipartite user-item interaction network where the graph topology captures detailed information about user-item associations, transforming a recommendation issue into a link prediction problem. Earlier, approaches for link prediction in bipartite graphs for various recommendation systems were developed, but the efficacy of the prediction methodology was not close to the standards required by real-time recommenders. So, the primary goal of this research is to offer an effective link prediction-based recommendation system that takes advantage of SVD++ along with K-nearest neighbors and reduces the system's error rate, leading to better outcomes. The proposed system is sorely tested on the MovieLens dataset and compared to some traditional recommendation methods. The results demonstrate that the suggested strategy exceeds all traditional approaches in terms of accuracy, and the actual suggestions are equally encouraging.}

Unique corroboration entropy is calculated based on the number of words in this review that describe the product on the seller’s site, confirming the seller’s claims, which did not appear in previous reviews. Recommendation entropy is based on the number of words that are associated with explicit recommendations. Unique opinion, referred as “regular opinions” in the literature, entropy is based on the number of all the other words in the review that provide positive or negative evaluations of products as well as other additional informational elements that did not appear in previous reviews. The results show that both recommendation and unique opinion entropies (only marginally) increase review helpfulness evaluations, while greater unique corroboration entropy is insignificant.}

Although many studies have explored how online reviewer status influences consumer contributions, how reviewer status affects reviewer preferences for anonymity, which is an important factor in consumer assessments of review credibility and consumer purchase decisions, is still unclear. In this paper, underpinned by hierarchical status and psychological theories, an empirical analysis is conducted regarding the ways that reviewer status shapes reviewer preferences for anonymity. Utilizing online review data from Ctrip.com and employing advanced text mining methods, we reveal that reviewer status positively influences their preferences for anonymity, but this effect is weaker for business-travel reviewers than for leisure-travel reviewers. Additionally, this positive effect is attenuated by reviewer openness but strengthened by reviewer conscientiousness. However, the moderating effect of reviewer neuroticism is not significant. Our findings substantially contribute to the literature on hierarchical status and information disclosure and provide significant practical guidance for incentive designers in the ecommerce domain.}

However, one of the research questions in this domain that has not been addressed so far is the impact of circumstances of review writing itself, which may influence the way the review is written and affect its credibility. In this paper, we describe a controlled experiment to study the impacts of a user's exposure to past reviews and the user's own product experience on the perceived credibility of reviews written by the user. We have employed attitude-behavior linkage theories and the disconfirmation effect to study this phenomenon. Our results indicate that disconfirmation, or the difference between a user's own experience and expected experience, has a significant impact on the way a user writes reviews and hence on the review's perceived credibility with the subsequent readers of the review. We find that disconfirmation and perceived review credibility follow a U-shaped relationship, in which perceived credibility is high for the highest and lowest values of disconfirmation.}

This study aims to map how digital has been examined to date in rural-focused studies, and accordingly present propositions for how rural-digital studies can be sensitive to the distinctive and diverse character of rural spaces and places. We conduct a two-stage/scale literature review, combining 1) computational topic modelling from a Global Dataset (459 article abstracts) with 2) qualitative content analysis from a sub-dataset focusing on the Nordic region (Nordic Sub-Dataset, 17 full articles). We begin with a topic modelling analysis generating ten major themes (topics) leading to an overview of how research areas are connected to the meaning of rural context. Turning to the Nordic region, as an in-depth example, we illustrate the complexity of rural digital geographies, through a qualitative content analysis. This demonstrates that digital in rural contexts are primarily positioned outwardly as social/regional development and business/economy, and less situated inwardly through individual experience and community building. Combined we show a wide spectrum of rural-digital relations but demonstrate that rural contexts in rural-digital relations need more attention. We propose three propositions to invite deeper rural contextualizations in future digital studies to uphold the importance of rural spaces and places through, by and with digital geography.}

At present, internet technologies make it possible for consumers to order goods and services on a go or in real-time without physically visiting traditional store outlets.

Accordingly, online marketing techniques such as personalized product/service recommendation, which makes products available to consumers, optimizing their interests and buying experience, are primal to market development. Therefore, this study examines whether or not online consumers' (1) E-impulse buying (EIB) behavior is influenced by personalized recommended product quality (RPQ), (2) affective image (IMAGE) of, and satisfaction (SAT) with recommended products mediate the RPQ-EIB link, and (3) online review stimulus (ORS) moderated the direct RPQ-EIB and indirect PRQ-EIB through affective image and satisfaction. Data was collected from consumers on five (5) online shops in China (N = 947). The Results showed that (i) RPQ had significant positive influence on EIB, (ii) the RPQ-EIB relation was partly explained by consumers' affective image of, and satisfaction with recommended products, and (iii) the direct and indirect relations between RPQ and EIB were sensitive to consumers’ ORS.

Over a long time, researchers have proposed different approaches to solve it. This paper proposes an unsupervised learning approach using transformer architecture to perform SA on women’s clothing e-commerce dataset which is imbalanced in nature. In this study, we have fine-tuned DistilBERT, a cutting-edge transformer based pre-trained model and developed models for two subtasks of SA named as Sentiment Classification (SC) and Product Recommendation (PR). The proposed models have achieved the highest F1 scores (0.79 for SC and 0.85 for PR), AUC scores (0.98 for SC and 0.96 for PR) along with the highest accuracy of 0.96 for SC and 0.91 for PR. We found that the performance of our models is least affected by imbalanced dataset issues. The results show that the proposed models have significantly outperformed the traditional supervised approaches and various other existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

In the field of business process, heuristic miner has been used to handle data noise in the event logs. This study aims to propose a method to build a transition matrix using the causal matrix based on the dependency measure in heuristic miner. The dependency measure resulted from heuristic miner is fed into a collaborative filtering approach, that is matrix factorization, to build a model. In the end, we compare the performance of the causal matrix with a traditional frequency-based approach to see the effect of the proposed method to remove the noise. The result showed that a transition matrix with a causal matrix from heuristic miner can produce a better performance than the transition matrix without the dependency measure with a causal matrix.}

The key point for lawmakers is how to choose two of the following three elements in the trilemma: personal data protection, free transborder flow of information and the expansion of national jurisdiction. The EU, the U.S. and China adopt their own decisions, resulting in three inherently incompatible legislative paradigms, which has led to the restricted flow of personal data around the world as well as the free flow in three different regions, with the EU, the U.S. and China as the center of each region. In this way, the regulating paradigms of cross-border personal data transfer presents a pattern of tripartition.}

abstract = {In recent times, fulfillment services in online marketplaces have witnessed a surge in popularity. Dominant e-commerce platforms, such as Amazon.com, now allow small retailers to join their online marketplaces, while concurrently providing comprehensive fulfillment services. In return, small retailers pay a fulfillment fee per unit of sales. We examine the advantages of these fulfillment programs in the context of a dominant retailer that possesses an online marketplace, alongside a small retailer who operates within this marketplace and possesses private fulfillment cost information. We analyze two scenarios, contingent upon the presence or absence of competition between the two retailers, and we derive the optimal fulfillment fees for the dominant retailer. Our findings indicate that the structure of market competition plays a pivotal role in shaping fulfillment fees and associated advantages. In the absence of market competition, the provision of fulfillment services consistently proves advantageous. This is attributed to enhancements in (1) consumer valuation of the small retailer's products and (2) overall system efficiency in fulfillment. Conversely, when there is competition, offering a fulfillment program may not be as lucrative if the improvements in product valuation and the degree of cost heterogeneity are minimal. Furthermore, our findings highlight that enhancements in product valuation can positively impact both retailers and consumer welfare, irrespective of market competition. However, in cases where cost heterogeneity arises due to asymmetric information, it may adversely affect consumer welfare in the absence of competition.}

We test this issue experimentally by differentiating: (a) types of internet access devices (regular computers vs. touchscreen devices) and (b) reactions of ethnic majority (French) and ethnic minority (Maghrebian) consumers in France. The findings show that attitude certainty acts as a key mediator between website cultural congruity, attitudes toward the site and purchase intentions. The effects of website cultural congruity are stronger when consumers use touchscreen devices than regular computers, and stronger for French ethnic majority than for Maghrebian ethnic minority consumers.}

However, impulse buyers may return the product when they calm down, leading to a high loss for the retailer. In this research, considering impulse buying and product returns, we explore the retailer's channel strategy within three channel structures: single traditional channel, single live streaming channel, and dual channel. We find that dual channel strategy dominates single live streaming channel strategy, and adopting live streaming may not always benefit the retailer. When there is a large proportion of impulsive customers and the product has a low marginal loss of return, it is better to adopt the dual channel strategy. Interestingly, the retailer will be more inclined to add a live streaming channel when there are more loyal consumers in the traditional channel. Moreover, considering the influence of product returns will make the retailer less likely to adopt live streaming e-commerce. Additionally, our analysis shows that consumer returns will significantly affect live streaming price. Under the single live streaming channel strategy, as the streamer possesses superior sales ability or there are more impulsive consumers, it is better to reduce the price. If the retailer neglects product returns, he will raise the price. Under the dual channel strategy, the retailer considering product returns will announce a low price in the live streaming channel and a high price in the traditional channel. However, if the retailer neglects product returns, he will announce a high price in the live streaming channel and a low price in the traditional channel.}

The purpose of this paper is to examine how customers might respond (emotion- or problem-focused coping) to service failure of a chatbot when there is an option to interact with a human employee. Using data from 145 participants, we found that in a chatbot service failure context, telling a customer late in the service interaction that a human employee is available to help leads customers to engage in emotion-focused coping, resulting in customer aggression. The positive relationship between late disclosure and emotion-focused coping occurs with those who perceive low customer participation whereby they do not believe they are overly involved in co-producing and co-delivering the service. This research demonstrates how chatbot service failure in a service encounter can produce different effects on customers’ intention to engage in aggression.}

The current paper analyzes the application and perception of Workforce Management Systems (WMS) in practice as one approach to counteract these issues and enable flexible warehouse operations. By means of an online survey and a detailed set of expert interviews, we analyze the current use of WMS and information items in retail. We investigate design and time horizons of workforce planning processes as well as forecasts and summarize main expectations and requirements of WMS from practitioners’ point-of-view. Our results show highly diverse usage patterns of systems with a strong emphasis on spreadsheet tools like MS Excel. The integration of legislation on working hours, qualification of employees and individual working time arrangements / contract details were mentioned as exemplary key information items of WMS. The typical time horizon of workforce planning for most participants was three months. Key requirements for an ideal WMS include the depiction of qualification profiles, productivity of individual employees, forecasting features, simulation-optimization tools to find best possible solutions with given workforce, automated planning as well as bottleneck reduction and handling. The results of our paper provide practitioners with an overview of expert opinions, present opportunities for system development, and provide future research tasks in WMS for warehouse operation.}

Using data collected through 20 semi-structured interviews with business managers and engineers involved in AI adoption for B2B marketing activities, as well as academic experts in the field of AI, this paper discusses how AI adoption priorities and motives shape the power dynamics amongst the various network actors, including focal firms, AI suppliers and tech giant companies. The findings show that, in the context of AI adoption in B2B, both technology and expertise are key sources of power, and that data creates and perpetuates power negotiations and renegotiations in the network. We envisage this process as the movements on a busy dancefloor where groups of actors are engaged in what we refer to as the Power Tango. This paper contributes to the power dependence theory by showing that, through the adoption process, network actors' power is exchanged, exercised, counter-balanced and perpetuated, creating fluid network dynamics.}

The two objectives are sorted according to their priority, and then the bi-objective optimization problem is converted to two optimization problems with single-objective, namely, the high-priority optimization problem and the low-priority optimization problem. First, a classical neural network is applied for the high-priority optimization problem. Then, a novel feedback neural network is constructed to find an optimal solution of the low-priority optimization problem in the optimal solution set of the high-priority optimization problem. It is proved that any accumulation point of the state sequence of the proposed feedback neural network is a Pareto optimal solution to the considered bi-objective optimization problem. In contrast with the existing neural networks, the proposed neural network has simple structure and relies on weaker convergence conditions. Finally, some numerical examples and an application in fuzzy optimization show the effectiveness of the proposed neural network.}

On one hand, existing methods are time-consuming and not generalizable across different domains. On the other hand, the datasets for the task generally suffer from the severe imbalance issue. To address abovementioned problems, we propose a framework adopting advanced deep learning methods to automatically learn features and a novel textual data augmentation method named TA3S to deal with the data imbalance issue. Specifically, the TA3S method simultaneously considers the syntactic structure and semantic information of comparative text samples. Moreover, in order to support the successful implementation of TA3S, we develop a novel method based on word embedding and label propagation algorithm to distinguish between synonymous and antonymous substitute words. The experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our framework, and present that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying comparative text from user-generated content.}

The results of two empirical studies confirm four dimensions of MS-SQ: efficiency, fulfilment, responsiveness and contact. Using bootstrapping of 2000 resamples, SEM results showed a significant impact of MS-SQ on customer satisfaction, which in turn impacts loyalty. These results are robust across two samples. Only the dimension efficiency exhibits an indirect effect on loyalty via satisfaction in both studies whilst controlling for gender, age, income, value of clothing item, and m-shopping experience.

This change manifests itself primarily in the fact that already 73% of Polish citizens shop online. E-commerce customers are generally optimistic about this type of shopping, and this opinion has even improved over the past year. Online shopping is primarily perceived as convenient and uncomplicated and offers more choice than buying in traditional stores. In this measurement, the perception of comfort was remarkably improved. As the period of online shopping lengthens, the level of experience acquired by e-commerce customers increases, which, on the one hand, not only improves the online shopping process but, on the other hand, may affect the perception of websites in terms of other criteria. Thus, the purpose of the article is to examine the relationships between the time of online shopping (understood as the acquisition of experience of e-commerce customers) by respondents and the assessment of individual variables. Research conducted among the e-commerce customers allowed us to make the following conclusion - the perception itself and perception of specific criteria influencing the functioning of the Internet platform changes during the time while experience in online shopping is being acquired. However, this does not mean that these ratings are constantly improving. In the case of the level of satisfaction and the assessment of meeting e-commerce customers’ needs above expectations, with the higher experience in online shopping, both the level of satisfaction and ratings regarding meeting the needs above expectations become lower. The obtained research results can be advice for online platforms in purchasing process management and customer service.}

abstract = {A session-based recommendation system recommends the next possible item for users by learning the click session sequences of anonymous users. Considering the session data used is anonymous and few background information is available, it is very challenging to solve these problems. Recently, although the session-based recommendation systems based on neural network have achieved gratifying results, there are still two problems in the existing methods: (1) The value of each dimension in the embedded layer result is a non-zero mean distribution and the numerical gaps are very large. Such numerical gaps will increase the variance of the gradient, hindering the parameter optimization, and thus leading to the final prediction results inaccurate; (2) The previous models cannot effectively learn the long-term dependency information and capture the dependencies between non-adjacent items in the session sequence. To solve the above problems, we propose a Session-based Recommendation with Temporal Convolutional Network to Balance Numerical Gaps model. Specifically, we first normalize the embedded layer results, then constrain the embedded results in the unit hypersphere to reduce their impact on gradient calculation, and finally use Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) complements the multi-layer self-attention network to learn the session sequence.The TCN can obtain large enough receptive fields to fully learn session representation and the short-range item dependence that is missing due to the distraction of attention distribution by the self-attention mechanism, and the self-attention method capture the one-to-one interaction of each item, and obtain the long-term dependence of the item. We have conducted a large number of experiments on three real-world datasets. The results show that, in most cases, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts methods.}

The proposed model was empirically evaluated using survey data collected from 219 users responding about their perceptions of customer service chatbots. The findings indicate that AI chatbot service recovery quality and AI chatbot conversational quality significantly influence user satisfaction. On the other hand, core AI chatbot service quality and satisfaction significantly influenced chatbot user loyalty. This study contributes to researchers and practitioners by proposing and evaluating a more comprehensive chatbot e-service quality that combines both fundamental (core service and service recovery qualities) and human-like (conversational quality) aspects of e-service.

However, as people spend more time on social media daily, concerns about its impact on mental health have grown. Although several studies on the effects of social media on mental health have been conducted, the number of studies focusing on this issue, particularly in Malaysia, is still limited. As a result, little is known about the link between social media and purchasing behavior, as well as mental health. In order to fill this gap, the current study examines the relationships between social media use and purchase behavior, social media use and mental health, and purchase behavior and mental health. The data were collected using a quantitative method by distributing a questionnaire to social media users, particularly the X, Y, and Z generations. Data from 195 social media users were analyzed using Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). There are significant associations between social media use and purchase behavior, as well as the impact of social media use on users’ mental health. There is no evidence, however, to support the significant association between purchase behavior and users’ mental health. The findings can help relevant agencies to better understand the impact of social media use on purchase behavior and mental health, and the impact of purchase behavior on mental health.}

The problem is to find a minimum cost tour over a set of customers and facilities in which the customer not visited on the tour is assigned to a feasible facility on the tour. The objective is to minimize the delivery and self-pick-up costs with the constraints of conflicting time windows provided by customers. This work puts forward a mixed-integer linear programming model to formulate the problem and provides a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve the problem. Several valid inequalities are developed and separated to improve the convergence of the algorithm. Sets of instances are generated, and the number of available facilities, the coverage radius of self-pick-up service are varied, to assess the effectiveness of the proposed formulations and algorithm. Experimental results show that instances involving up to 150 vertices can be solved optimally within one hour.}

We employ both machine learning and econometric methods to analyze a unique dataset of 55,096 shows by the top 1,000 live streamers on Alibaba’s live streaming platform. We identify three distinct clusters. The most important differentiating features include a live streamer’s platform affiliation and product category. Selling more products and spending more time on each product in a live-streaming show are two factors driving both GMV and fan growth. We also discover that a large fan base does not always help, as the positive effect of fan base only exists conditionally.}

Utilizing the diverse sample of 241 US-based TBNVs, we comparatively analyze the relationship between companies’ evolution curves represented by search activity on the one hand and by valuations achieved through rounds of venture investments on another. The results suggest that TBNV's growth dynamics are positively and strongly correlated with its web search traffic across the sample. This correlation is more robust when a company is a) more successful (in terms of valuation achieved) – especially if it is a “unicorn”; b) consumer-oriented (i.e., b2c); and 3) develops products in the form of a digital platform. Further analysis based on fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) shows that for the most successful companies (“unicorns”) and consumer-oriented digital platforms (i.e., b2c digital platform companies) proposed approach may be extremely reliable, while for other high-growth TBNVs it is useful for analyzing their growth dynamics, albeit to a more limited degree. The proposed methodological approach opens a wide range of possibilities for analyzing, researching and predicting the growth of recently formed growth-oriented companies, in practice and academia.}

abstract = {In the realm of e-commerce, various return freight modes are available, such as platform-bearing return freight (PP strategy), retailer-bearing return freight (RP strategy), and consumer-bearing return freight (CP strategy). The return freight strategy adopted by platforms plays a crucial role in responding to consumer behaviors. To analyze how platforms determine the optimal return freight strategies, we examine a supply chain comprising a platform, a retailer, and heterogeneous consumers, employing a Stackelberg game model to capture their decision dynamics. Our findings suggest that the platform should opt for the PP strategy only when the product profit margin is relatively low. If the platform refuses to adopt the PP strategy, then the RP strategy is preferable when consumers face extremely high consumer return freight costs; otherwise, the CP strategy is the equilibrium result. We also prove that the selection of the return freight strategies leads to changes in the property of the equilibrium. Under the CP strategy, how the product fit probability affects the optimal price depends on the procurement cost; while under the RP and PP strategies, the optimal price decreases with the fit probability. Moreover, under the PP strategy, an increase in the product fit probability does not always benefit the platform. Further, our analysis reveals that, while the PP strategy can reduce the retailer’s risk, it might negatively impact supply chain performance, which implies that cost sharing in the supply chain does not necessarily lead to a higher channel profit. We also investigate how the platform’s return freight strategies affect consumer surplus and identify regions for Pareto improvement where all parties benefit from the PP strategy. Finally, by exploring extensions like positive salvage values, partial refunds, platform competition, and differentiated return freight costs, we confirm the robustness of our findings and unveil new insights.}

Companies launching new goods, services, or modifications to their current offers must anticipate client behaviours. Businesses can learn a lot about how current customers behave by studying their behaviour in order to develop marketing and sales techniques that work. The study uses a variety of statistical and machine learning methods to forecast the most important elements influencing the purchasing of sustainable jewelry in order to achieve this. These variables span a wide range of characteristics, including gender, age, educational attainment, occupation, gross monthly income, marital status, previous jewelry purchase history, purchase intention, preferred shopping locations, online purchase influencers, consumer buying patterns, preferences for branded and non-branded jewelry, and participation in sustainable jewelry practices. In this study, supervised classification algorithms such Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Decision Tree are compared over a wide range of machine learning approaches. To increase the predictive model's effectiveness and resilience, ensemble learning techniques including Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Bagging Classifiers are also introduced. A confusion matrix and classification report are the performance indicators used to assess these models. When used on a test dataset, these measures evaluate the model's precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 scores. These measurable metrics are essential for evaluating the models' reliability and efficacy. Notably, the study shows that the approaches of Random Forest, Decision Tree, Bagging Classifier, and Linear Discriminant Analysis continuously produce the highest accuracy rates, all of which stand at a remarkable 100% accuracy. Other used machine learning classifiers, such as Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, and AdaBoost algorithms, which provide significantly lower accuracy scores, fall short of this degree of accuracy. The Random Forest Classifier, which boasts a remarkable accuracy score of 100% for the training dataset and a reasonable 53% for the testing dataset, is particularly noteworthy. This classifier surpasses its competitors, demonstrating its potency in forecasting purchases of sustainable jewelry. In order to forecast sustainable jewelry purchases, this study uses a rigorous methodology that draws on a variety of statistical and machine learning models. The Random Forest Classifier is the most accurate and significant model for this predictive task, with Precision, Recall, and F1 scores of 100, according to the results, which were assessed using multiple performance measures like Precision, Recall, and F1 score.}

Using a sample of 2028 customer-supplier-firm observations in China, we find that, on average, the stock price of a supplier negatively reacts to its customer's qualitative risk information disclosure. Our findings are robust to alternative metric of qualitative risk disclosure, alternative metric of stock price reaction, after accounting for customer stock returns, and after mitigating selection bias. Moreover, when comparing the magnitudes of coefficients, we find the impact of the qualitative risk information disclosure on suppliers' stock price is larger than the firm, industry, and macroeconomic information embedded in the same annual report; its value is also greater than the impact of a customer's negative stock price. Last, we show that the adverse impact of customers' qualitative risk information disclosure is more salient if the customers are relatively important or the information is more useful to investors. We discuss implications of our findings to supply chain risk management.}

What the incentive effects of the three subsidy mechanisms are and how to choose the appropriate subsidy mechanism deserve further research. To solve those problems, considering the consumer environmental preference, a three-stage Stackelberg model consisted of the government, the manufacturer and the retailer is constructed. The optimal product design for environment and sales effort decisions and profits of the two-echelon supply chain under three kinds of subsidy schemes are compared. And, from the perspectives of social welfare maximization and the marginal environmental impact, the optimal subsidies of three subsidy schemes and the best subsidy scheme are identified, respectively. The results show that the preferences of the manufacturer and the retailer for different subsidy policies depend on the level of three subsidies. The unit profit of the green product and the environmental cost affect not only the existence of optimal subsidy but also the choice of subsidy scheme. Based on the above conclusions, key policy and managerial implications can be generated that the government should set appropriate subsidy scheme and the level of subsidy in accordance with the unit profit of the green product and the environmental cost. Besides, from the perspectives of social welfare and environmental impact, the government should not choose to subsidize the retailer’s sales effort. Finally, managers should increase the profit of the green products to obtain higher government subsidy.}

abstract = {Basel Committee recommends banks maintain a capital buffer for operational risk exposure based on business volumes, assuming aggressive actions for quicker business growth could increase risk exposures. We argue that technological innovations expose banks to more operational risk because technology helps increase business volume, but system failure, problems with internal processes, and disruptions from external and internal security threats are inherent to technology. Based on 10 years of data for 264 banks from 43 countries, we find that digitalized banking operation is an underlying driver of operational risk that comes with increased business volume. Banks proactively take more operational risks by increasing cyber spending to tackle FinTech competition in the digitalized economy. Digitalization could generally matter for operational risk exposure, but the natural experiment does not find cybersecurity threats per se could increase operational risks even though cybersecurity appears to be a serious threat to digital banking. The study creates new avenues for future research.}

However, RSs have additional effects, which are related to their impact on users’ choices. In order to avoid an undesired system behaviour and anticipate the effects of an RS, the literature suggests employing simulations. In this article we present a novel, well grounded and flexible simulation framework. We adopt a stochastic user’s choice model and simulate users’ repeated choices for items in the presence of alternative RSs. Properties of the simulated choices, such as their diversity and their quality, are analysed. We state four research questions, also motivated by identified research gaps, which are addressed by conducting an experimental study where three different data sets and five alternative RSs are used. We identify some important effects of RSs. We find that non-personalised RSs result in choices for items that have a larger predicted rating compared to personalised RSs. Moreover, when a user’s awareness set, which is the set containing the items that she can choose from, increases, then choices are more diverse, but the average quality (rating) of the choices decreases. Additionally, in order to achieve a higher choice diversity, increasing the awareness of the users is shown to be a more effective remedy than increasing the number of recommendations offered to the users.}

Data were collected through a survey in China (n = 199). The results show that environmental stimuli significantly influence consumer perceived values (i.e., perceived utilitarian value and perceived hedonic value), and the consumers’ perception of hedonic value significantly and directly impacts their IBB. In addition, the interaction effect of perceived hedonic value and interpersonal influence significantly affects IBB. The findings provide valuable guidance for m-commerce retailers to induce consumer IBB.}

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is an ecosystem of interconnected devices (IoT devices) that is capable of intelligent decision making. IoT devices can include everyday objects such as televisions, cars and shoes. The interconnectedness brought forth by IoT has extended the need for cybersecurity beyond the information security realm into the physical security sphere. However, ensuring cybersecurity of IoT devices is far from straightforward because IoT devices have several cybersecurity challenges associated with them. Some of the pertinent cybersecurity challenges of IoT devices in this regard relate to: (i) Security During Manufacturing, (ii) Identification and Authentication, (iii) Lack of Encryption, (iv) Large Attack Surface, (v) Security During Updates, (vi) Lack of User Awareness and (vii) Diverging Standards and Regulations. Against this background, the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) has been proposed to complement the existing EU cybersecurity framework consisting of legislations such as the Cybersecurity Act and the NIS2 Directive. However, does the CRA provide a framework for effectively combating the cybersecurity challenges of IoT devices in the EU? The central crux of the CRA is to lay down and enforce the rules required to ensure cybersecurity of ‘products with digital elements’, which includes IoT devices. To this end, several obligations are imposed on manufacturers, importers and distributors of IoT devices. Manufacturers are mandated to ensure that the essential cybersecurity requirements prescribed by the CRA are met before placing IoT devices in the market. While the cybersecurity requirements mandated by the CRA are commendable, the CRA suffers from several ambiguities which can hamper its potential impact. For instance, the CRA could provide guidance to manufacturers on how to conduct cybersecurity risk assessment and could clarify the meanings of terms such as “limit attack surfaces” and “without any known exploitable vulnerabilities”. When the fundamental themes of the CRA is analysed from the prism of the cybersecurity challenges of IoT devices, it becomes clear that the CRA does provide a foundation for effectively addressing the cybersecurity challenges of IoT devices. However, the expansive wording in various parts of the CRA, including in the Annex I Requirements, leaves scope for interpretation on several fronts. Consequently, the effectiveness of the CRA in tackling the Security During Manufacturing Challenge, Identification and Authentication Challenge, Large Attack Surface Challenge and Diverging Standards and Regulations Challenge would be largely contingent on how harmonised standards develop and how the industry adopts them. The CRA seems to be more effective, albeit not fully so, in significantly addressing the Lack of Encryption Challenge, Security During Updates Challenge and Lack of User Awareness Challenge of IoT devices. However, the manner in which the CRA addresses all these cybersecurity challenges could be improved upon if an agency such as the ENISA was given the legal mandate to set elaborate standards for cybersecurity requirements under the CRA.}

Using data from “East Buy”, a popular live streaming room in China, we show that speech content of streamers can be categorized into informative and affective topics, and these two types of topics have different effects on users' engagement across behavioral, emotional and relational dimensions. The findings contribute to the existing literature on livestreaming commerce by enhancing our understanding of the informational and emotional support derived from streamers' speech content. Moreover, this study goes beyond a broad concept of user engagement by differentiating it into behavioral, emotional, and relational engagement. By doing so, we extend the current literature on user engagement and investigate how streamers’ topic types influence each aspect in the context of live streaming commerce.}

Companies and researchers typically favor and employ one of three methods to calculate the RR: based on the number of returned items, these items’ revenue, or their profit contribution. Interviews with 24 managers and industry experts reveal that two methods, item-based and revenue-based, are often used. However, little is known about how much the interpretation of RRs depends on the calculation method. In this article, the authors rely on extensive datasets to investigate these potential differences empirically. Analyzing more than 8 million transactions at sixteen different retailers, the authors find that RRs calculated via the three methods differ on average by 24.3%. The size of these differences makes cross-sectional comparisons of RRs calculated via different methods difficult. In contrast, the authors find that the developments of the RRs over time are similar, which allows for a meaningful time-series comparison of RR developments, regardless of the method. Finally, this research shows that all three calculation methods result in RRs that are equally insightful (leading) indicators of relevant retailer performance metrics.}

This paper contributes an analytical overview of why and how the new regulation is shaped by focusing on its legislative background, substantive rules and enforcement mechanisms. The influence of the GDPR in shaping this regulatory paradigm is scrutinized, with reference to pertinent concerns that could compromise the effectiveness of this paradigm in the Chinese context. The central edifice is that this landmark statutory instrument, broadly resembling the GDPR with certain variations, revamps the existing data protection regime in China. Nevertheless, as in its current form, the law fails to address several critical matters. The tentative conclusion is that the current construction of PIPA is necessary but far from sufficient.

In hope, the people will be interested to switch their modes of transportation to using public transportation considering the congestion and air pollution in Jakarta which is horrible. By utilizing data from twitter, this study tries to analyze public opinion on public transportation by classifying theirs opinions into positive & negative. Furthermore, topic modeling activites will be conducted using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method to find out topics that are often discussed publicly for each public transportation. It was found that the KRL is the only type of public transportation with the number of negative responses exceeding the number of positive responses. It was found that in the MRT & LRT, the community tended to mention words that had positive sentiments, whereas in KRL & TJ people tended to mention words that had negative sentiments. In the grouping of public opinion, the LDA model produced a topic of public discussion on public transportation that was different for each type of public transportation. The model can also capture public communication with the official account administration of public transportation. Prediction models obtained the lowest error with a Mean Average Percentage Error of 8.79%. By adding the public sentiment variable, it can improve the accuracy of the prediction model, but the tweets sentiment variable has no direct relationship to the variable number of public transportation users.}

Firstly, user preferences and intents can be described in fine-grained detail from multiple perspectives; yet, these methods fail to capture their multi-aspect nature. Secondly, user behaviors may contain noises, and most existing methods could not effectively deal with noises. In this paper, we present an attentive recurrent model with multiple projections to capture Multi-Aspect preferences and INTents (MAINT in short). To extract multi-aspect preferences from target behaviors, we propose a multi-aspect projection mechanism for generating multiple preference representations from multiple aspects. To extract multi-aspect intents from multi-typed behaviors, we propose a behavior-enhanced LSTM and a multi-aspect refinement attention mechanism. The attention mechanism can filter out noises and generate multiple intent representations from different aspects. To adaptively fuse user preferences and intents, we propose a multi-aspect gated fusion mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model.}

Specifically, the authors focus on five strategies: (1) the addition of online channel by an offline retailer; (2) the addition (or subtraction) of offline channels by an online retailer; (3) addition of mobile shopping channel (website and/or app) by offline and/or online retailer; (4) cross-channel integration strategies; and (5) retail marketing mix strategies. The author/s integrate findings from empirical research on these strategies into a number of ‘insights’ about ‘what we know’. Prominent among these are the following: Adding a transactional online channel to an offline channel improves the retailer's overall sales even though offline channel sales can be cannibalized to some degree. Adding an offline channel by an online retailer, however, boosts online channel sales as well as overall sales of the retailer. Similarly, adding a mobile shopping channel usually increases customer purchase frequency and amount and overall sales of the retailer in the long-term. Strategies for greater cross-channel integration generally have a positive effect on a retailer's overall performance while online advertising has positive effects on offline channel consideration and sales as well as overall sales of a multichannel retailer. Other insights or findings that need further study or open questions are also identified.

In addition, we employed quantile regression as a robustness check. We investigated two sets of hypotheses – first, the direct relationships within each variable and the helpfulness, and second, the moderating effect of product type (tangible vs. intangible) on each relationship. The results show that a more readable review can help the user process information faster. The arousal, star ratings received, and multimedia content positively affect review helpfulness. The practical implications of the paper are as follows. First, it highlights the importance of using multimedia content, such as videos and images that reviewers submit, in addition to regular textual reviews. Second, we propose a customised sorting mechanism based on product type to highlight the significant reviews for a specific product. The theoretical implications of the paper are as follows. The textual and multimedia information represents the fundamental essence of a review. This is part of the essential processing outlined by the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning because the essential processing helps comprehend the message more easily. However, review length had an inverse U-shaped (concave) relationship because a long review increases extraneous processing.}

abstract = {Demand forecasting is important information for all enterprises. Accurate forecast information determines the success of supply chain operations. This paper studies the selection strategy of e-commerce sales mode and information sharing strategy in a dual-channel supply chain. The manufacturer and e-retailer enter a Stackelberg competition. The e-retailer independently decides to share or not share forecasting demand information to the manufacturer. The results show that only if the investment efficiency of the manufacturer’s after-sales service is high, e-retailer is willing to share demand forecasting information. Information sharing does not always add value to the e-retailer, which may lead to the ‘precision trap’ of the e-retailer. Moreover, forecasting accuracy always has a positive impact on the e-retailer’s profit. However, the manufacturer would benefit from more accurate forecasting demand in the case of sharing information. Otherwise, prediction accuracy is negatively correlated with the manufacturer’s profit. Besides, the selection strategy of e-commerce sales mode depends on the level of the manufacturer’s investment efficiency. Specifically, if the manufacturer invests in after-sales service more efficiently, platform sales mode is preferred. If not, they prefer wholesale sales mode.}

This paper investigates the impact of app adoption on the number of additional products purchased by customers (i.e., cross-buying) and how this effect varies across different product categories and different customers. We focus on two key product category characteristics (utilitarian vs. hedonic nature and perceived risk) and on adopters who vary in their adoption timings (early vs. late adopters). Using data from an online retailer and a combination of propensity score weighting with difference-in-differences and Heckman correction estimation techniques, the results show that app adoption has a positive effect on cross-buying overall, but the effect varies greatly across products and consumers. App adoption promotes additional product purchases for hedonic products but leads to less cross-buying for utilitarian products. In addition, early adopters purchase a higher number of additional product categories than late adopters, with this difference decreasing over time and for new consumers compared to existing customers. These results offer novel insights into the behavioral consequences of app adoption and provide managers with useful recommendations for improving the effectiveness of their mobile app investments.}

By implementing an augmented Lagrangian relaxation technique, the VRPMBTW is reformulated as a quadratic 0–1 programming model, which is further decomposed into the standard least-cost-path sub-problems, and iteratively solved by dynamic programming in a block nonlinear Gauss-Seidel framework.

abstract = {In online purchases, customers often exhibit considerable hesitations due to quality uncertainty and return freight fees. In response, online retailers may buy the return freight insurance (RFI) service from insurance companies that compensate the customers when they return the purchased item. With the RFI service, insurance companies generally verify the quality information posted by the retailer to avoid excessive customer returns. Thus, the RFI service not only reduces the customer’s return freight but also acts as an imperfect quality signal for customers to mitigate quality uncertainty. We characterize the RFI’s imperfect signaling effect by signal efficiency, and develop a game-theoretic model to investigate the RFI strategies of insurance companies and the retailer. Our results shed light on how signal efficiency and return freight fees drive their RFI strategies. The insurance companies charge an extremely small RFI premium for the retailer selling high-quality products; for the retailer selling low-quality products, the RFI premium becomes large for those with a medium return freight fee, or with a small signal efficiency. The retailer selling high-quality products always adopts the RFI service. The retailer selling low-quality products does not adopt the RFI service when the return freight fee is large. Given a medium return freight fee, the retailer with low-quality products prefers the RFI service when the signal efficiency is medium. Given a small return freight fee, only when the signal efficiency is large does the retailer with low-quality products adopt the RFI service. Our results provide new explanations for the prevalence of the RFI service for retailers selling products of different quality, and shed light on the RFI premium strategy for insurance companies.}

The research model was developed with the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) theory as its foundation, after collecting data from a useable sample of 289 respondents, comprising of business founders, managers, employees, and vloggers across several startup industries, the research hypotheses were tested using AMOS (version 24), a program for conducting structural equation modeling (SEM). The study results showed a direct association of SLS efforts with all of its endogenous variables, i.e., SLS adoption, consumer investment, and firm performance. Furthermore, consumer investment fully mediates the relationship between SLS adoption and firm performance. SLS experience noticeably moderates all of our study model's anticipated pathways. Based on the study's findings, some significant theoretical advancements and entrepreneurial ramifications have been identified. The report finishes by identifying its shortcomings and ideas for future research.}

Therefore, it focuses on understanding the barriers to and enablers of IoT adoption in planting and harvesting vegetables. We built a theoretical framework that incorporates the constructs of individual and organizational technology adoption models, linking behavioral, technological, organizational, and environmental factors. The framework is supported by the technology-organization-environment (TOE) and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) models. We conducted in-depth interviews with 15 producers, three agricultural sector experts, and four suppliers. The results showed that only established producers implemented technology, indicating that organizational factors are decisive for the adoption of the IoT. Thus, the producer's size, knowledge, management level, and investment power affect IoT adoption. The theoretical model needs to be assessed according to producers' size, thereby revealing that organizational factors directly influence producers' behavioral issues.}

This study adopts a comparative research approach and investigates direct strategies adopted by various food supply chain actors to mitigate the impact of covid-19. This study compares how retailers Checkers, Woolworths, and Pick n Pay have adapted their business models to remain resilient during COVID-19 lockdown. The results show that the food supply chain remained resilient even with demand management challenges at the lockdown. Food supply chain issues came under a spotlight as borders and production plants were shut down or restricted to contain the spread of the virus. This study establishes that the food shortage is primarily caused by panic buying at the beginning of lockdown, causing shock in the supply chain cadence. The other aspect of food security issue is attributed to food availability and socioeconomic problems resulting from loss of income. On sustainability, there are fears that control measures such as packaging (increased use of plastic), cleaning chemicals, waste and sanitisation of space to maintain hygiene as required for covid-19 can undermine the gains towards preserving the environment.}

From the perspective of different sellers with same products or services, this paper analyzes and discusses the formation of credit risk in E-commerce based on the game theory, and presents some suggestions for future application of E-commerce credit. In order to reduce the loss caused by E-commerce credit risk, the government should play a macro-control role or participate in the game process as a participant to influence the game result. The government can guide enterprises’ game activities through legal and economic levers such as legislation, taxation, to make the results approached to the Pareto optimal solution, and the utility of the entire society will be increased.}

To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a fake review detection model using aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) while considering the effects of product types. Using a dataset of Amazon reviews, our ABSA model revealed that two aspects are fundamental for detecting fake reviews and suggests the need to associate the two. These are the product category and the verified purchase attribute (with the greatest contribution observed for credence and experience product types).}

A total of 77 countries are categorized into three clusters, Initial, Fast-Adoption, and Maturity, grouped by their adoption rates and the speeds over four-years from 2014 to 2017. With pooled and fixed-effect panel data models, this paper examines which variables out of 22 independent variables are effective in enhancing apps adoption globally. Further, by interacting two dummy clusters, Initial and Maturity with determinant variables, the study identifies the differential policy effectiveness of each determinant factor on apps adoption. The paper concludes that the three stages of apps diffusion levels have their respective effective strategy choice sets: 11 for Initial stage, 12 for Fast-adoption stage, and 13 for Maturity stage, suggesting that countries should develop their mobile apps inclusiveness strategy tailored to their context of apps adoption.}

In particular, they ignore the unique graph structure for information propagation and thus fail to fully explore the potentials of GCN. To tackle the problem, we propose a GCN-based self-training approach, called STL, which exploits the learning results in the training procedure, and the potential relations in the embedding space of GCN. First, to handle the data sparsity, we modify the interaction graph structure by adding edges linking a selected part of users and their potential positive items. Second, we adaptively expand the set of positive samples that are used in the pairwise loss function, which not only supplements the dataset but also avoids sampling noises. Further, similarity of structural neighbors on graph is used to mine hard negative sample for improving the sample quality. Experiments on three representative GCN-based recommenders and four widely used public datasets show that STL alleviates the problem of data sparsity, thereby improving recommendation performance compared to normal training.}

abstract = {Modern day store brands (SB) or private labels (PL), now also popularly called private brands, are brands generally owned and marketed by retailers. They have been active on the market for about 70 years. Over this time span, these brands have evolved from generic, cheap, low-quality economy or budget private labels to lower-priced-than-national brand but acceptable-quality value or standard private labels. Over time, retailers extended the value proposition to the consumer segment seeking higher quality by offering premium private labels. This strategy, called the tiered-private label, comprises offering economy PL to the price-sensitive but not quality sensitive consumers, standard PL to mainstream consumers seeking acceptable quality at lower prices, and premium PL to the quality-sensitive segment seeking value. Over the last 40 years (1980–2020), these versions of private labels have witnessed substantial growth around the world, though the growth is said to be tapering in recent times. As retailers chart the future strategy for their private labels in 2020 and beyond, a pertinent question they face is: Should they continue to offer value or even tiered PL with the same formula that brought them success in the past, or should they morph and adopt new strategies in keeping with current market trends? We support adopting a new strategy that we call the smart PL strategy. The value PL strategy and its manifestation as the tiered PL strategy cater to different consumer segments but focus primarily on price and quality as attributes of choice. In the current marketplace, consumers care not only about price and quality, but also about sustainability, ethics, social responsibility, image, so forth, perhaps more so than earlier generations. They are also more tech-savvy in using digital tools for search and purchase. Retailers, on their part, are now endowed with rich, extensive data that they can tap into to understand customers’ diverse needs, and they are able to harness technology for developing the right product and communication. Thus, the smart PL strategy is a strategy by which retailers can leverage data and technology to market private labels that meet diverse customer needs and achieve greater retail differentiation, store loyalty, margins, and profits. This thought piece provides a road map for developing such a smart PL strategy and directions for future research.}

Our methodology involved searching for articles published in the last six years into four different literature databases. The search of articles employs a search string composed of the following keywords: purchase, buy, transactions, fraud prevention, fraud detection, e-commerce, web commerce, online store, real-time, and stream. We apply six filtering criteria to remove irrelevant articles. The methodology resulted in 64 articles, which we carefully analyzed to answer five research questions. Our contribution appears in the updated perception of fraud types, computational methods for fraud detection and prevention, as well as the employed domains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey on combining prevention and detection of e-commerce frauds, linking also architectural insights, artificial intelligence methods, and open challenges and gaps in the research area. The study main findings demonstrate that from 64 articles, only five focus on the fraud prevention problem, and credit card fraud is the most explored fraud type. In addition, current literature lacks studies that propose strategies for detecting fraudsters and automated bots in real-time.}

abstract = {Even though the online channel is generally not bounded by space, much insight can be derived from examining the variation in online patronage across retail space. In this paper, we propose the use of a Bayesian approach utilising the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) within its framework to estimate the risk ratios as well as probabilities of online patronage. To this end, we used publicly available data (such as household access to broadband connection, population figures and business location data) in combination with online transaction data from a focal retailer to estimate and identify which locations (i.e., postcodes) have the highest probabilities of patronage from online customers of the retailer. The three covariates adjusted for were presence of a competitor, average income at the postcode level and internet access at the postcode level; of these, internet access was found to be the most significant influencing factor on online patronage of the retailer. Overall, the resultant spatial maps provide useful predictions of how the estimated risk ratios and exceedance probabilities vary across the geographic market and the implication on opening a new offline outlet and targeting customers are discussed.}

This paper suggests that business and society are two peas in a pod and are mutually interdependent. One cannot survive without the other. The purpose of business is more than business. It is to nurture all of its stakeholders (employees, customers, suppliers, and community) and not just the investors. This is still common in many small-town manufacturing companies whose families, and their families, live in the community. The paper suggests several implications for B to B companies including developing a stakeholder scorecard, becoming a better customer to suppliers, and redefine the purpose of business.}

As product suppliers can no longer secure their competitive position through former product-related competitive advantages, more complex product offerings and integrated solutions consisting of products and services, so-called “product-service systems (PSS)”, are increasingly being offered. But how can PSS implementation and the digital servitization transformation process be successfully accomplished? This paper addresses this research question and examines the transformation process of several companies using a mixed-methods approach that includes the evaluation of objective data-based efficiency for an idealized servitization path. The study shows how important it is for companies to maintain or even strengthen former product-based competitive advantages and to build on them to develop new business areas. It also shows that companies are simultaneously implementing bi-directional product support services and customer support services. In addition, data-oriented services such as condition monitoring and remote services are proving to be the basis for offering more complex performance- and results-oriented PSS, where customers pay per unit produced rather than fixed fees. Moreover, for the first time, it can be concluded that digital services are the basis for the successful establishment of digital industrial IoT platforms.}

People all around the world are experiencing direct and indirect consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, mobile phone technology can provide sophisticated solutions to cope with a pandemic environment. Thus, as a pilot study in this research, the author focused on Polish consumers’ mobile phone usage behaviour towards their online shopping buying behaviour before and during the Covid-19 pandemic time. An online field survey was conducted to collect primary data from the respondents during the month of April 2021, and the total number of participants was recorded as 102. In order to reach conclusions, mainly two types of statistical hypothesis tests were carried out. Hypothesis test 1 was conducted to determine whether the respondents were demonstrating a significant usage increase in the average number of online shopping transactions per month and during the Covid-19 pandemic time. Hypothesis test 2 was conducted to determine whether there was a difference in the average number of online shopping transactions per month during the pandemic time of the respondents based on their age group. Descriptive and inferential statistics, including the matched-pairs test and one-way ANOVA, were applied to the analysis. The researcher is in a position confirm that there is a significant difference in the average number of online shopping transactions per month before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, there is no significant difference in the average number of online shopping transactions per month during the pandemic time made by representants of two generations, generation X and Millennials. The results of the study were significant since the primary data collection was done during April 2021. The pilot study will help to understand how the respondents online buying behaviour through mobile phone usage changed during the pandemic. The added value of the conducted pilot study involves filling in a gap regarding the differences and similarities between generational groups on mobile shopping during the Covid-19 pandemic time.}

Our findings identify three layers of the AI platform where interactions between platform users and the platform take place. We further identify six roles adopted by these users and highlight the mechanisms of their interactions with the platform. Our findings further explore the conditional factors relating to these interactions, namely, knowledge (operational, functional, and technological), organizational processes, and access to external data. With these findings, our study contributes to the platform literature by highlighting its multi-layer architecture. Our study also contributes to the literature on service platforms by describing five types of interactions experienced by platform users when leveraging platforms.

We posit AI as a new actor that has blurred the lines of the actors-resources-activities model. Findings show AI is now considered a new actor within B2B networks wielding dark force consequences such as algorithmic gatekeeping, which initiates dehumanization effects. In addition, AI is reliant on access to datasets which drives up resource costs. A lack of accountability of AI marketing solutions leads to opportunistic behaviours compromising actor relationships. Our conceptual model maps our understanding of the dark force consequences underpinning theoretical and managerial implications and recommendations for increased awareness and mitigation of dark forces.}

Drawing from the dual perspectives of expectancy confirmation theory and task technology fit theory, we theorize and test an integrated research model on the collective impact of user expectancy confirmation regarding ICA capabilities and their assessment of service-ICA fit on user acceptance. Results from a field survey of 350 users of five ICAs deployed by major Canadian telecom service providers reveal the significant influence of both user expectancy confirmation with ICA capabilities and their assessment of ICA fit-to-service, with the latter playing a more prominent role in shaping user acceptance. Even though ICA performance may not always meet user expectations, users are still willing to engage with ICA services when they perceive the ICA as a fitting solution for their specific service complexity and availability requirements.}

Based on a Chinese national survey data, we found strong supports for the hypotheses except the moderating effect of transgenerational control. Overall, the study contributes to the family business (FB) literature by unveiling that technological changes can serve as additional antecedent of FFs' professionalization. It further highlights that different levels of family ownership lead to different responses to new institutional logics and findings in developed economies may not apply to those in emerging economies like China.}

abstract = {Deterministic concurrency control is able to avoid the expensive two-phase commit in distributed databases and can solve the single-thread bottleneck of transaction processing in blockchain systems. Most existing deterministic concurrency control protocols rely on prior knowledge of the transaction’s read-write set, which is impractical in most cases. The state-of-the-art deterministic concurrency control protocols Aria and DOCC break this limitation. However, they do not perform well in multi-node and multi-core scalability. To solve the scalability issues, we propose Dodo, a novel deterministic concurrency control protocol. Dodo processes transactions in multi-batches, and each batch is divided into three phases. In the first phase, transactions are executed as read committed and staged. In the second phase, transactions are validated for the read-write conflict. In the third phase, only the continuous un-conflicted transactions at the head of the batch can be committed. For the aborted transaction that will be rerun in the next batch, we utilize its write set in the previous execution to reduce the read-write conflicts in the next batch. In this way, Dodo has the following benefits. First, Dodo does not rely on the prior knowledge of the read-write set. Second, Dodo commits transactions in pre-determined orders (TIDs) providing high multi-node scalability. Third, Dodo runs transactions in each phase concurrently, and the aborted transactions are re-executed in a conflict-less manner, enabling high multi-core scalability. Besides, we propose two optimism-based improvements, lazy decision and early-write visibility, to reduce aborts and blocking. Our evaluation shows that Dodo outperforms Aria and DOCC by up to 16.5x and 8.0x in a single-node setting and scales well in a multi-node setting.}

This paper studies how an O2O platform can attract physical (offline) grocery retailers through pricing and market expansion, and customers by providing shopping convenience and home-delivery. We analyze both when the O2O platform has self-scheduling delivery capacity and when it does not. We find that two widely used pricing schemes—revenue sharing and fixed fee—are equivalent. If the O2O platform does not itself have any self-scheduling delivery capacity, it outsources home-delivery service to a delivery platform, which may result in incentive misalignment. We find that it is not always necessary for the O2O platform to coordinate the decentralized system. Under some conditions, the decentralized system will yield higher profit than the centralized system due to the risk protection effect. If coordination is needed, we propose subsidy contracts for the O2O platform to align its and the delivery platform’s objectives.}

These challenges may lead to order tardiness and decreased efficiency and responsiveness of warehouse logistics. This study jointly optimizes order picking and delivery in ergonomic picking systems by addressing order assignment, sequencing, picking, and delivery operations while considering due dates and minimizing order tardiness and delivery costs. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model is formulated, and an improved knowledge-guided fruit fly optimization algorithm with the shortest waiting time rule (IKGFOA-SWT) as a heuristic solution procedure is developed to solve the problem. The IKGFOA-SWT comprises three modules including an order assignment and sequencing module using IKGFOA, an order picking module employing the SWT rule, and a batch delivery module balancing the delivery and tardiness costs. Computational experiments are conducted to validate the MIP model and evaluate the performance of IKGFOA-SWT. The benchmark experiment underscores the importance of integrating order picking and delivery operations within a unified scheduling framework rather than treating them as independent optimization tasks. The small-scale experiment verifies the effectiveness of IKGFOA-SWT in finding optimal solutions. The large-scale experiment demonstrates the superiority of IKGFOA-SWT in generating high-quality solutions. This study provides valuable managerial insights and practical tools for the optimization of warehouse logistics operations, and contributes to the new norms of supply chain sustainability and resilience.}

The findings demonstrate that online sellers engaging in more interactions that involve receiving tangible assistance or knowledge tend to realize better online sales performance, while interactions involving providing tangible assistance or knowledge also may benefit sellers’ sales performance through increasing the receipt of resources. In addition, sellers more active in receiving knowledge tend to have higher sales in markets in which they face greater competition intensity.

Motivated by these observations, we use the Hotelling model to develop a duopoly game, in which a traditional retailer and an online retailer sell the same product to consumers, to examine the effectiveness of price matching and logistics service enhancement in improving profitability. The results show that in the scenario where the online retailer does not conduct logistics service enhancement, the traditional retailer benefits from price matching only when the transportation cost to the brick-and-mortar store is high. However, in the scenario where the online retailer conducts logistics service enhancement, when the transportation cost is relatively low, the traditional retailer also has a chance to benefit from price matching. In contrast, regardless of the traditional retailer’s price matching strategy, the online retailer always benefits from logistics service enhancement. We also reveal that regardless of the online retailer’s logistics service enhancement strategy, the traditional retailer’s price matching can lead to Pareto improvement for both retailers as long as the transportation cost is high enough. However, only when the traditional retailer adopts price matching does the online retailer’s logistics service enhancement have a chance to lead to Pareto improvement for both retailers.}

abstract = {Live stream marketing through social media has attracted the attention of digital retailing marketers in recent years. However, there is a lack of evidence in understanding the influence of in-store live stream on offline purchase intentions. This study aimed to investigate the influence patterns of environmental stimuli on consumers' intention to purchase offline/in-store after watching an in-store live stream session. The Stimuli-Organism-Response (SOR) model was employed as the theoretical framework, and a structured questionnaire was used to collect data from individuals who had previous experience with in-store live stream marketing. Structural equation modelling was then applied for data analysis, with a total of 234 valid responses. The findings revealed that environmental stimuli have a significant positive effect on consumers' intentions to make in-store purchases, and the attitudes towards influencers and products substantially mediate the relationship between stimuli and purchase intention. More specifically, consumer attitude towards products has a pronounced effect on whether they will make an in-store purchase. The novelty of this research lies in its investigation of the impact that live stream marketing has on offline or in-store shopping experiences. This contrasts with the majority of existing live stream studies, which focus on consumers’ online shopping experiences. In addition, this study broadens the scope of the application of the SOR model to contribute to the growing body of literature on live stream marketing.}

However, there are still problems with the existing methods. Existing approaches can be divided into two groups based on data organization: (1) graph-based methods using graph neural networks to capture complex item transformations; (2) sequence-based approaches using self-attention networks to capture chained user interest patterns. Both methods are only applicable to specific kinds of user interest patterns due to the characteristics of the neural networks they use and cannot be adaptively used in all scenarios. Moreover, the recent approaches capture collaborative information from other sessions by constructing global graphs, etc., in order to enrich the current session, which can compromise personalized modeling due to the introduction of items that are not relevant to the current user. This work proposes a graph-enhanced and collaborative attention network (GCAN) to solve the above problems. In GCAN, graph-enhanced attention is designed to model user interest over item-specific subsequences with the help of a graph mask and distance bias, which include item transformations mined in session graphs and chained user interest in session sequences. In addition, collaborative attention is proposed to model the item representation within the current session at the collaborative level by exploiting the collaborative information from all sessions. Extensive experiments on three real benchmark datasets show that GCAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.}

To address this issue, we propose a novel RLfD objective function with a new shaping reward, by optimizing which can directly leverage the supervision signal on these demonstrated states. We propose a general framework for policy optimization of the proposed objective, with convergence guarantees under the classic tabular setting. Based on that, we further make some approximations based on deep neural networks, and then introduce a new practical algorithm, called Demonstration Actor Critic (DAC) in large continuous domains. Extensive experiments on a range of popular benchmark sparse-reward tasks show that our method can lead to significant performance gains over several strong and off-the-shelf baselines.}

This study employs a game-theoretic framework to investigate the dynamics of a manufacturer establishing a business ecosystem by collaborating with a partner on a supply chain platform. The partner, in turn, offers complementary products to consumers, thereby fostering a symbiotic relationship within the ecosystem. Motivated by the need to understand the implications of such business ecosystems, this study explores their effects on firms operating in the competitive market. Additionally, we examine the impacts of two distinct advertising strategies: product-focused and platform-oriented advertising strategies. Our analytical results reveal several interesting findings. First, forming a business ecosystem based on a supply chain platform increases profits for both the manufacturer and the partner. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that the manufacturer should selectively adopt a platform-oriented advertising strategy based on the magnitude of the platform advertising effect. Moreover, we uncover that the partner’s product-focused advertising strategy fosters a win-win outcome for all firms in the market, ensuring economic sustainability, particularly in the face of intermediate-level market competition. This research provides insightful recommendations for understanding the dynamics of the supply chain, shedding light on the strategic decisions and advertising strategies that drive efficiency within such ecosystems.}

The seller either has associates bid in the seller’s auctions, or the seller controls multiple fake bidder accounts that are used for shill bidding. We proposed a reputation system referred to as the Shill Score that indicates how likely a bidder is to be engaging in price inflating behaviour in a specific seller’s auctions. A potential bidder can observe the other bidders’ Shill Scores, and if they are high, the bidder can elect not to participate as there is some evidence that shill bidding occurs in the seller’s auctions. However, if a seller is in collusion with other sellers, or controls multiple seller accounts, the seller can spread the risk between the various sellers and can reduce suspicion on the shill bidder. Collusive seller behaviour impacts one of the characteristics of shill bidding the Shill Score examines; consequently, collusive behaviour can reduce a bidder’s Shill Score. This paper extends the Shill Score to detect shill bidding where multiple sellers are working in collusion with each other. We propose the first algorithm to provide evidence of whether groups of sellers are colluding. Based on how tight the association is between the sellers and the level of apparent shill bidding that is occurring in the auctions, a suspect bidder’s Shill Score is adjusted appropriately to remove any advantage from seller collusion. Performance is demonstrated using simulated and commercial auction data and extensive experimental results are presented.}

The Online Visual Aesthetics Theory Model proposes that the perception of the composition of an online medium is directly influenced by the eight web design categories: Graphics, Text, Simplicity, Animation, Layout, Unity, Emphasis, and Balance. The variance of each of these web design categories may then be explained by the more traditional seven primary design dimensions: Lines, Shapes, Colors, Textures, Forms, Values, and Spaces. The final instantiated Online Visual Aesthetics Theoretical Model is then presented and a program of study is articulated for the evaluation and validation of the proposed theoretical model.}

This feature makes agent-based systems naturally suitable to address the challenges in Supply Chain Management (SCM). Although agent-based supply chains systems have been proposed since the early 2000s; industrial uptake of them has been lagging. The reasons quoted include the immaturity of technology, a lack of interoperability with supply chain information systems, and a lack of trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this paper, we revisit the agent-based supply chain and review the state of the art. We find that agent-based technology has matured, and other supporting technologies that are penetrating supply chains; are filling in gaps, leaving the concept applicable to a wider range of functions. For example, the ubiquity of IoT technology helps agents “sense” the state of affairs in a supply chain and opens up new possibilities for automation. Digital ledgers help securely transfer data between third parties, making agent-based information sharing possible, without the need to integrate Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Learning functionality in agents enables agents to move beyond automation and towards autonomy. We note this convergence effect through conceptualising an agent-based supply chain framework, reviewing its components, and highlighting research challenges that need to be addressed in moving forward.}

As such, the omni-channel retailer faces more challenging problems of pricing and order fulfillment compared with the pure e-commence retailer. With the omni-channel features, we study the joint dynamic pricing and (cross-channel) order fulfillment problem of an omni-channel retailer with a network of physical stores and fulfillment centers facing limited initial inventory and no replenishment opportunity in a finite selling season. The classical multinomial logit (MNL) choice model is used to characterize the customer demand with the above omni-channel features. Then, the omni-channel joint dynamic pricing and order fulfillment policy (OPFP) is identified based on the optimal solution of the deterministic relaxation to the stochastic control formulation of the original problem. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the proposed approximation policy is asymptotically optimal. We examine some variants of this OPFP to address the problem under various practical constraints and show that they maintain sufficiently good performance. In addition, we show that the proposed OPFP can yield a lower average order fulfillment cost than the heuristic order fulfillment policy that chooses the bricks-and-mortar store with the lowest fulfillment cost. We also find that the improved performance of the re-optimization policy can be offset by the loss of sales volume transfer between channels for large-scale problems.}

abstract = {Composite services (CSs) are large-grained services composed of simple ones to satisfy users’ complex requirements. A major issue concerning a CS is that the general quality of service (GQoS) and the domain quality of service (DQoS) of its component services often fail due to environmental changes. However, existing research fails to consider how to actively perceive GQoS failure and DQoS failure of component services, and cannot perform dynamic reconfiguration of composite services proactively. To tackle this problem, we propose an approach for dynamic reconfiguration of CSs by automatically detecting both GQoS and DQoS failures. Our approach includes three stages: at the first stage, we estimate the failure judgement basis of GQoS and DQoS for each component service based on a preferences-aware global GQoS decomposition method and a statistical method. In the second stage, during the execution of a CS, we proactively estimate whether the component services to be executed will encounter GQoS or DQoS failure based on a novel GQoS and DQoS joint prediction method. At the third stage, when the component service to be executed encounters GQoS or DQoS failure, we reconfigure the CS by replacing the failed component service with a best-matched similar service, while we also apply the GQoS and DQoS joint prediction method to predict GQoS and DQoS of the matched service, so as to ensure that the matched service can satisfy the local GQoS and DQoS constraints of the failed component services. Moreover, to improve the efficiency of replacement services selection, we cluster the large scale services based on a multi-attributes aware services clustering method in advance. Extensive experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance superiority of our approach.}

abstract = {With live streaming becoming an integral part of a seller’s business strategy, a retailer can choose an influencer from a multi-channel network (MCN) to attract consumers. However, since the MCN may benefit from exaggerating the influencer’s historical live sales data, information asymmetry between the retailer and the MCN exists. This may lead the retailer to misestimate the influencer’s demand-enhancing capability (DEC), and then suffer loss. As the usage of blockchain in providing trust becomes more common, an MCN can apply blockchain technology to signal its data reliably to a retailer. However, conditions for MCN to adopt blockchain and its impact on retailer’s influencers choice has not been investigated so far. To fill this gap, we built a signaling model in which an MCN knows the actual information reliability whereas the retailer does not. We find that the retailer opens a live-streaming channel only if the operating cost is low but the retailer will use its own staff in the live streaming rather than an influencer from MCN if the commission is high. This makes the MCN to refrain from adopting blockchain technology. Meanwhile, the blockchain adoption decisions of the MCN and its impact on the retailer’s influencers choice not only depend on the adoption cost but also the commission. Specifically, when the adoption cost is low, a high-reliability MCN benefits more from adopting blockchain technology, which incentivizes the retailer to choose a high-DEC influencer; as the adoption cost increases, retailers become unable to judge the MCN’s information reliability, especially when the commission level is too low or too high; when the adoption cost increases to a moderate range, multiple equilibria co-exist, indicating that an MCN’s willingness to adopt blockchain technology depends on the retailer’s belief. We find that all equilibria survive the intuitive criterion, but, from both types of MCN’s perspectives, the equilibrium without blockchain adoption is always Pareto-dominant. When the adoption cost is high, an MCN has no incentive to adopt blockchain technology.}

Firstly, we proposed a conceptual model based on complex adaptive systems theory and institutional theory to demonstrate how this mechanism can ensure an improvement of the emergent rural digital governance performance. Subsequently, we translated the conceptual model into a computational representation, thereby constructing a theory-informed simulation model. A behavioural dataset consists of 1,255,206 rural households from 119 villages over a span of 18 months was used to instantiate and validate the simulation model based on a specific scenario. Then, we designed five simulation experiments to investigate interventions aimed at harnessing the D-IPT mechanism more effectively to improve the rural digital governance performance. The results show that interventions targeting interaction efficiency, interaction frequency, and institutional environment configuration significantly affect the role of the D-IPT mechanism in enhancing rural governance performance. Finally, we discussed the theoretical and practical implications of the D-IPT mechanism.}

How to utilize short interaction sequences of anonymous users for practical recommendations has become a critical issue. Current research on SBR generally suffers from noisy terms interfering with prediction, difficulty in capturing long-term dependencies, and ineffective utilization of session-level information. Inspired by the outstanding learning ability of the sparse attention mechanism for distant information and reduced noise through sparse transformations, we propose an SBR model. We combine the graph neural network with sparse graph attention mechanisms to learn enhanced and denoised target information and long-term preferences. In addition, we propose a similar-intent collaboration module that can efficiently utilize session-level collaboration information. Combining the information, the model generates a reliable representation of the session. Our model is superior to the current SOTA model on three widely used datasets (Diginetica, Tmall, RetailRocket).

At the same time, this allows platforms to gather detailed information on transactions and tailor their strategies when introducing their own products that compete with independent sellers. Concerns have been raised that such an information advantage of platforms can hurt sellers. To investigate the impact of information usage by platforms, we analyze a dynamic game-theoretic model where competing sellers trade via a platform that has access to information at various levels of granularity. We show that the usage of more detailed and individualized information by the platform can actually benefit sellers. This occurs as sellers compete less intensely, anticipating that the platform would take advantage of more individualized information to target the more successful sellers. The competition relaxing effect is particularly strong when sellers are close substitutes and face little demand uncertainty within their product category. In such cases, both the platform and sellers could benefit from more individualized information usage, but consumers may be hurt.}

Intuitively, each user often takes some implicit actions (e.g., click) before making an explicit decision (e.g., purchase). Previous studies show that implicit and explicit feedback has different roles for a useful recommendation. However, these studies either exploit implicit and explicit behaviours separately or ignore the semantics of sequential interactions between users and items. In addition, we go from the hypothesis that a user’s preferences at a time are combinations of long-term and short-term interests. In this paper, we propose some Deep Learning architectures. The first one is Implicit to Explicit (ITE), to exploit users’ interests through the sequence of their actions. The second and third ones are two versions of ITE with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers based (BERT-based) architecture called BERT-ITE and BERT-ITE-Si, which combine users’ long- and short-term preferences without and with side information to enhance users’ representations. The experimental results show that our models outperform previous state-of-the-art ones and also demonstrate our views on the effectiveness of exploiting the implicit to explicit order as well as combining long- and short-term preferences in three large-scale datasets.

In two studies, consumers rate their perception of produce offered in an online shop. Specifically, consumers assess quality concerns, affective response, and willingness to pay (WTP) in offline versus online retail contexts. Results demonstrate that high-NFT consumers express higher quality concerns and lower affective response to online offered produce. This negative influence of NFT is stronger if consumers use indirect compared to direct touch interfaces. Further, NFT influences WTP difference between offline and online offered produce. Online retailers therefore need to carefully manage quality concerns and negative perceptions that high-NFT consumers express during online produce shopping. A third study proposes a solution through online videos as visual design features. Displaying haptic evaluations of high-touch diagnostic produce by other consumers successfully negates NFT’s adverse influences.}

abstract = {Willingness-to-cede (WTC) profit behaviours for the purpose of effective cooperation have increasingly emerged as a best practice in competitive supply chain environments; however, this has been complicated by sustainability issues. Inspired by this fact, we study normative prescriptions and models that can be used to coordinate sustainable supply chains considering supply chain leaders' WTC behaviour. Along this line, we adopt a multi-methodological approach and carry out a two-stage analysis of a three-player duopoly supply chain (SDSC) with a leader (i.e., the focal firm) and two competitive followers who provide sustainable products or services. In the first stage, we adopt a non-cooperative game to characterize the interactions within five non-cooperative and cooperative models. In the second stage, to coordinate the SDSC, we first derive the characteristic functions from the equilibrium results of the five models and then revise the classical equal allocation of the non-separable contribution (EANSC) value by incorporating the leader's WTC behavioural parameter. This revised EANSC value serves as a novel solution and thereby enhances the scientific value of the cooperative game theoretical approach. Analytical and numerical studies show that under conditions in which the leader has power and is willing to cede, the optimal coordinated solutions can be obtained when both sustainability competition and the WTC are at a low level; leaders are not willing to cede profits if sustainability competition is high due to product substitutability between two followers. This research illustrates how behavioural theory and non-cooperative and cooperative game theory can be sufficiently modified and adopted to advance supply chain-level cooperation for sustainability. We further carry out a survey and interviews to provide empirical evidence to support our findings.}

In this paper, we develop a model on how in scarcity messages, the inventory level affects the online sales goods. We test the model against evidence from e-commerce sales data of about 35,000 printed books. We find that for e-commerce sales, lower inventory promotes sales late but inhibits purchases in the early stages of the purchase process. We reflect this counterintuitive finding against propositions grounded in different theoretical bodies. Thereupon, we summarize our research contributions and provide some implications for research and practice. We conclude with identified study limitations and suggestions for future research.}

This article highlights the effects of uniform resource constraints on horizontal mergers with game theory methods. First, the threshold values for the firms to accept the merger, increasing consumer surplus, and increasing social welfare are presented and compared. Second, the threshold value to merge for consumer surplus maximization is larger than that for profit incentive mergers without resource constraints. Thus, under unbinding resource industries, mergers reduce consumer surplus and it is necessary to implement antitrust. Third, resource constraints deter mergers. Finally, under binding capacity (or resource) constraints, the threshold value for firms to merge is larger than that for the social optimality. Therefore, industries with scare resource should avoid antitrust.}

It is hence no surprise that the retail sector is one of the hardest-hit sectors in the current pandemic. To understand the short- and longer-term impacts of COVID-19 on retail, we conducted two surveys to understand ongoing changes in the sector. By contrasting changing consumer behavior with the actions taken by local retailers, we assess whether the current pandemic is potentially a catalyst for e-commerce in Belgium. We do this based on a newly constructed framework of e-retail accessibility, as the differences between online and physical retail require a revision of the traditional economic geographical perspective on retail performance as introduced by Christaller (1933). We conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic holds ample opportunities for an increase in the three components of e-retail accessibility, but that a lack of professionalism might prevent traditional local retailers to retain a share of the expanded online market. This could well mean the final blow for local brick and mortar shops if, as is predicted, the share of online shopping in total retail expenditure remains high after the pandemic.}

Further, we identify two firm-level contingencies – direct network externalities and engagement in business-to-business transactions – that condition the effect of cross-national distances on the location choice decision. Using a global data set of 185 I-business firms, we find that cultural, geographic and economic distances negatively impact the location choice. While direct network externalities strengthen the negative relationship between certain types of distance and location choice, a business-to-business (B2B) model weakens that relationship. Our study demonstrates the continuing role of distances on the internationalization of I-business firms.}

However, the lack of human resources and the need for more content assertiveness per reader lead publishers to search for an advanced analytics solution. We address this problem by proposing a research agenda on news recommendation algorithms inspired in the table d’hôte approach and the concept of ‘personalized diversity’. Thus, the reader receives a personalized newsletter where he can discover informative and surprising content. The goal is to offer a self-contained package that retains readers, increases loyalty and consequently, the propensity to subscribe. A live controlled experiment with readers from the Portuguese newspaper Público was performed and a new approach is proposed. We study the effects of content recommendations on the behavior of newsletter subscribers. Findings reveal that serendipitous content tends to increase reader engagement. Finally, we propose a table d’hôte approach and new challenges are identified for future research.}

Drone–truck combined operation (DTCO) solutions are based on vehicle routes and drone launch and retrieval locations, usually customer nodes. Since a perfect synchronization of both vehicles is very rare, most of the solutions obtained after designing combined delivery routes generally contain time losses, caused by the need for the first vehicle that reaches the meeting point to wait until the arrival of the other. In this paper, a pseudo node insertion method is proposed to make DTCO solutions more efficient by improving the truck–drone synchronization operations. To this end, starting from a given routing solution, pseudo nodes are created at the point where a drone and a truck can meet simultaneously. We present a detailed method to calculate the location of the pseudo nodes and provide a detailed analysis of the conditions that allow us to reduce the travel completion time for different route patterns. Furthermore, we explore a variety of scenarios to illustrate the efficiency of the pseudo node insertion method for different DTCO problem solutions. An algorithm for the pseudo node insertion method is provided, and numerical examples are presented to discuss the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed approach.}

Food delivery applications (FDAs) have altered the way customers order and consume food. This was compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, which imposed restrictions on people's mobility. In this study, the authors have tried to determine which barriers affect consumers' emotions and feelings, leading to satisfaction, repeat visit, and WOM recommendations.
Method
ology: The Innovation Resistance Theory has been used to conduct the study. The Mixed Model is also framed to address the barriers faced by FDA users. This study also identifies key barriers of FDA (Value Barrier, Image Barrier, and Environment Barrier) and also studies their effect on consumer emotions and feelings in addition to the impact on repeat purchase behaviour, customer satisfaction and word of mouth recommendation. The data is collected from 392 respondents.
Findings
The findings demonstrate that apart from the value barrier, all the other barriers have negative and significant impacts on consumers’ feelings and emotions. It further supports the mediation effect amongst consumer feelings and emotions, satisfaction, repeat purchase, and WOM recommended. The moderating effect of transaction cost has been shown with different associations.
Implications
The service providers should make sure that all transactions are safe and secure and that food is delivered on time. They should also have good ways for customers to get in touch with them, so they will get orders from them.
Originality
The focus of the study is on the link between satisfaction, repeat purchases, and word-of-mouth recommendations for FDA, which hasn't been looked into in any previous studies.}

In this arena, advancements have been accomplished using deep learning techniques to model users’ long-term and short-term preferences in a session. The long-term module focuses on the entire item set in a session, while the short-term emphasizes a fixed set of items just before making a choice. While users’ short-term preferences in general reflect their immediate actions or intentions, consideration of such preferences, specifically with a fixed item set, makes the prediction task increasingly challenging. In this work, we attempt to capture the short-term behavior of users considering a dynamic window which self-tunes depending on the category of the last few items. A novel gating network that leverages the different drivers such as price, rating, dwell time, etc. and the latent representation of the items and their categories is introduced. The efficacy of our proposed method Gated Session-based Recommender integrating Short and Long-term preferences (GSRSL) has been evaluated against eight recent baselines on four publicly available real-world datasets, Tmall, Diginetica, and Cosmetics.

We also envisage the existence of CE-based differences across physical goods (versus service) contexts, leading us to include the nature of the offering (good vs. service) as a moderating factor in our model, making a novel contribution. To test the model, a survey was conducted in the tangible sports goods (i.e., sports retail) and -service (i.e., sports club) contexts. The findings substantiate a positive effect of customer learning and knowledge sharing on CE, thus empirically validating conceptual literature-based claims. In addition, CE was found to exert a favorable effect on customer cocreation and relationship quality. Moreover, the results confirm our hypothesized moderating effect by revealing the framework’s stronger associations for service- (vs. product-based) CE.

Many recent SBR methods construct all sessions as a global graph that captures cross-session item transition patterns (i.e., users’ global preference) to alleviate the problem of session data sparsity. However, these methods neglect that users’ interests will drift as the time between the sessions constantly increases, limiting the performance improvement of SBR. To fill this gap, we divide all sessions into a group of time-slices and model the cross-session item transitions for every time-slice. We further construct two augmentation views (i.e., temporal graph and temporal hypergraph views) to model pairwise and high-order item transitions on SBR. In addition, we construct contrastive learning between two views to improve the recommendation performance by maximizing the mutual information between the item representations learned from the two views. Experiments on three public real-world datasets (i.e., Diginetica, Retailrocket, and Yoochoose) show that our model is consistently superior to the other state-of-the-art baselines, especially in time-sensitive datasets. For instance, our model achieves 14.42% and 11.72% improvements in terms of P@10 and P@20 on the Diginetica dataset, respectively.}

These platforms are also dynamic, with shows or discussions changing quickly inside a room and users frequently switching between rooms. To improve user engagement and experience on such platforms, we design a new recommendation model named Dynamic Representations for Live Streaming Rooms (DRIVER) to provide room recommendations. Guided by the Integrated Framework for Consumer Path Modeling and the social affordance theory, DRIVER infers dynamic representations of live streaming rooms by leveraging users’ behavior paths in entering, staying in, and leaving rooms. One contribution of our model is a new and efficient dynamic learning framework to model instantaneous and ever-changing inter-room relationships by considering individual users’ behavior paths after leaving a room. Also supported by social affordance theory, another methodological novelty of our model is to capture dynamic characteristics of a room by incorporating features of the current audience inside the room. Experiments on real-world datasets from two different types of live streaming platforms demonstrate that DRIVER outperforms state-of-the-art representation learning methods and sequential recommender systems. The proposed method also has implications for recommender system design in other contexts, in which items are characterized by users’ dynamic behavior paths and ongoing social interactions.}

We found the variables from TAM, TRA/TPB, UTAUT, and the IS Success model to be important in motivating consumer behavior. Furthermore, we found the variables from the IS Success model to be less strongly correlated with SC behavior than the variables from other theories. In contrast, the variables from UTAUT are more strongly correlated with SC behavior. We found interpersonal trust to be more strongly correlated with SC behavior (r+=0.497) compared with organizational trust (r+=0.411). More importantly, we found the difference to be statistically significant (Z=-3.838). This study makes theoretical contributions through a moderator analysis, which helps to better understand the underlying consumer behavior theories, and further examines the role of trust in the integration of such theories. The study also makes contributions to practice by informing SC platform providers on how their consumers behave during the stages of the purchase decision-making process.}

To efficiently retrieve products and services, web directories allow customers to browse multiple-level taxonomies to find specific products or services according to a predefined categorization. Providers need to periodically update web directory lists by aligning in-house taxonomies to domain-specific hierarchies coming from external sources. However, such taxonomy mapping procedures are often semi-automatic and rely on traditional word disambiguation techniques to capture the semantics behind categories and products descriptions. Hence, the flexibility and explainability of the underlying models are quite limited. This paper proposes an automated, explainable approach to web directory taxonomy mapping based on text categorization. It exploits two complementary word-based text representations: a frequency-based representation, which captures syntactic text similarities, and an embedding one, which highlights the underlying semantic relationships among words. Since the proposed solution is purely data-driven, it can be successfully applied to business domains where there is a lack of semantic models. The frequency-based text representation has shown to be particularly suitable for driving the automated taxonomy mapping procedure, whereas the embedding space has been profitably used to provide local explanations of the category assignments.}

abstract = {With the recent prevalence of online fashion-oriented communities and advances in multimedia processing, increasing research interests have been paid to the fashion compatibility modeling, where the compatibility between complementary fashion items (e.g., a top and a bottom) can be assessed automatically. Existing fashion compatibility modeling techniques mainly focus on measuring the compatible preference between fashion items with Deep Neural Networks (DNN), but overlook the generative compatibility modeling. Differently, in this paper, we explore the potential of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in fashion compatibility modeling and thus propose a Multi-modal Generative Compatibility Modeling (MGCM) scheme. In particular, we introduce a multi-modal enhanced compatible template generation network, regularized by the pixel-wise consistency and template compatibility, to sketch a compatible template as the auxiliary link between fashion items. Accordingly, MGCM is able to measure the compatibility between complementary fashion items comprehensively from both item-item and item-template perspectives. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme over state-of-the-art methods.}

We use a multilevel analysis, applying fsQCA to data obtained from 47 Portuguese firms. The results represent an important step forward in the knowledge of the conditions to promote higher stages of DT, especially regarding leadership and management associated with certain firms’ characteristics. The conclusions support the crucial role of leadership and especially the importance of managers’ coherence towards companies’ mission to promote more advanced stages of DT. At the same time, it contributes to develop knowledge about the best possible combination of firms’ and management characteristics to promote DT.}

Scholars have proposed frameworks to address outcomes of implementing technology e.g., an increased customer experience, efficiency gains, consumer or employee acceptance. Existing frameworks concentrate primarily on the consumer perspective, focus on specific technologies (e.g., AI) and covering the customer journey. In contrast, this paper also focuses on the employee perspective, and how technology influences the employee journey. Since the convenience offered by online retailers puts offline retailers under pressure, this research focuses on in-store technology. Based on a comprehensive review of managerial and academic literature and expert interviews, we propose a framework covering customers and employees, and technology's function (increasing efficiency or experience), as also including more traditional and newer technologies, such as robots and AI. We identify and showcase technologies increasing efficiency for customers (quadrant 1, e.g., checkout options or autonomous stores) or for employees (quadrant 2, e.g., in-store robots), and enhancing the experience for customers (quadrant 3, e.g., retailer apps or communication) or for employees (quadrant 4, e.g., exoskeletons or smart wearables).

This study uses an Expectation-Confirmation Model (ECM) framework to explore the Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Security & Privacy, Trust, and Satisfaction factors that affect the continuance intention. Also, this research investigates the antecedents of Perceived Security & Privacy and Trust, namely Security Technology Protection, Security Rules & Policy, Security Responsibility Commitment, Coverage of Mobile Payment Context, and Uncertainty Avoidance. This study uses a quantitative approach using online questionnaires with 426 respondents. The results show that Perceived Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Trust strongly influence the continuance use intention of electronic money applications. Application providers should improve Security Responsibility Commitment because it can affect Trust directly or indirectly through Perceived Security & Privacy. Apart from Security Responsibility Commitment, Security Technology Protection and Uncertainty Avoidance are also antecedents of Perceived Security & Privacy. This research provides understanding and guidelines for increasing the continuance use intention of electronic money applications, especially in developing countries.}

We collected data from Taobao village EC ecosystems to validate the proposed hypotheses. Using 258 valid responses, we reveal the following: (1) Platform compatibility, a second-order latent construct, includes IT-commerce alignment and resource-sharing routine alignment. Platform compatibility positively affects realized synergy. (2) Integration effort positively affects platform compatibility and realized synergy. (3) Realized synergy positively impacts social and economic value. (4) Realized synergy mediates the relationship between critical enablers (integration effort and platform compatibility) and social and economic value. Specifically, the relationship between platform compatibility and social and economic value is partially mediated, while the relationship between integration effort and value is fully mediated. These findings extend systems theory by offering deeper insights into the integration of systems theory and RBV, particularly highlighting the mediating role of synergy. They reveal that compatibility and integration effort directly contribute to value creation, and that synergy further amplifies these effects.}

The findings reveal three configurations in which different combinations of product, consumer, and channel factors may interact in different ways to explain high webrooming intention. Notably, product involvement was identified as the core condition in all configuration paths. This study enriches the theoretical foundations of webrooming behavior, and the findings yielded are expected to assist retailers in developing better-targeted strategies in dealing with this increasingly prevalent cross-channel behavior.}

Existing techniques use review content to identify fraudulent reviewers; however, spammers become more intelligent, started to learn from their mistakes, and changed their tactics in order to avoid detection techniques. Thus, investigating fraudulent accounts' behaviour of generating fake negative or positive reviews for competitors or themselves and the necessity of ML classifiers to identify fraudulent reviews, is more important than ever. In this research, we present a novel feature engineering approach in which we (1) extract several “review-centric” and “reviewer-centric” features from a dataset; (2) combine the cumulative effects of features distributions into a unified model that represents overall behavior of the fraudulent reviewers; (3) investigate the role of effective data pre-processing to improve detection accuracy; and (4) develop a probabilistic approach to detect fraudulent reviewers by learning a novel M-SMOTE model over a derived balanced dataset and feature distributions, which outperforms other ML models. Our study contributes to the literature on digital platforms and fraudulent review detection with significant managerial and theoretical implications through these novel findings.}

We consider a supply chain system consisting of one brand seller, one counterfeiter and one platform retailer and examine how blockchain adoption affects the decisions of firms in this system and the performance of the whole system. We show that the platform’s use of blockchain reduces both products’ selling price and increases the brand seller’s demand while also increasing the counterfeiter’s demand under certain conditions when a wholesale contract is adopted. Moreover, we find that blockchain technology could be an effective anticounterfeit tool but that the platform does not always use it, even if its implementation is costless. The platform is more willing to use blockchain when imitation good’s quality is relatively low, and an agency contract can better incentivize the platform to deploy blockchain than a wholesale contract if the commission fee is large. Finally, consumer surplus and social welfare may decrease after the platform adopts blockchain, but the whole supply chain system can perform better through the platform’s blockchain implementation if the imitation good’s quality and consumers’ trust in the platform are low.}

Organisations that deploy data scientists and operational researchers (OR) must address the ethical implications of their use of data and algorithms. We review the OR and data science literature on ethics and find that this work is pitched at the level of guiding principles and frameworks and fails to provide a practical and grounded approach that can be used by practitioners as part of the analytics development process. Further, given the advent of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) an ethical dimension is likely to become an increasingly important aspect of analytics development. Drawing on the business analytics methodology (BAM) developed by Hindle and Vidgen (2018) we tackle this challenge through action research with a pseudonymous online travel company, EuroTravel. The method that emerges uses an opportunity canvas and a business ethics canvas to explore value creation and ethical aspects jointly. The business ethics canvas draws on the Markkula Center's five ethical principles (utility, rights, justice, common good, and virtue) to which explicit consideration of stakeholders is added. A contribution of the paper is to show how an ethical dimension can be embedded in the everyday exploration of analytics development opportunities, as distinct from a stand-alone ethical decision-making tool or as an overlay of a general set of guiding principles. We also propose that value and ethics should not be viewed as separate entities, rather they should be seen as inseparable and intertwined.}

Although contrastive learning has been used extensively to address this problem, existing methods generally consider all other sessions in the mini-batch as negative samples, leading to a limited negative sample space and a failure to distinguish real negative samples from false negative samples. Thus, Semantic-enhanced Contrastive Learning for Session-based Recommendation (SCLRec) is proposed in this study. Specifically, a queue is designed to store session samples, and a momentum encoder is used to ensure high consistency in the large-capacity sample space. Furthermore, a novel semantic-enhanced mechanism is devised to filter out false negative samples and increase the weights of high-confidence negative samples according to semantic similarity scores between sessions, effectively reducing noise and enhancing contrastive learning. Moreover, the gated attention unit is used as the encoder to obtain excellent performance and efficiency compared with traditional attention networks. Extensive experiments on three real-world public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a relatively low time complexity.}

abstract = {The boost in the use and development of technology, spurred by COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences, has sped up the adoption of new technologies and digital platforms in companies. Specifically, companies have been forced to change their organizational and work structures. In this context, the present study aims to identify the main opportunities and challenges for remote work through the use of digital technologies and platforms based on the analysis of user-generated content (UGC) in Twitter. Using computer-aided text analysis (CATA) and natural language processing (NLP), in this study, we conduct a sentiment analysis developed with Textblob, which works with machine learning. We then apply a mathematical algorithm for topic modeling known as Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. Based on the results obtained from these data-mining techniques, we identify 11 topics, of which 3 are negative (Virtual Health, Privacy Concerns and Stress), 4 positive (Work-life balance, Less stress, Future and Engagement), and 3 neutral (New Technologies, Sustainability, and Technology Issues). In addition, we also identify and discussed 6 opportunities and 5 challenges in relation to the use and adoption of digital technologies and platforms for teleworking. Finally, theoretical and practical implications of the study are presented for companies that develop strategies based on teleworking and the adoption of new technologies in which stress management is configured as one of the most relevant indicators for further research on remote work. From the applied perspective, executives and policymakers can use the results of the present study to re-evaluate the benefits of remote work for employees.}

abstract = {In the digital economy, many business-to-business companies expect their salespeople to promote e-commerce channels to customers as alternative ways to purchase. However, salespeople are often hesitant to comply with this approach, which despite its high practical relevance, has been rarely examined by academic research. Therefore, the authors develop a theoretical framework outlining key determinants of salespeople’s promotion of e-commerce channels. To this end, the authors integrate relational-selling theory with goal-setting theory and test their conceptualization using a multilevel data set comprising surveys of 68 salespeople, 220 customers, and objective company data. The results show that salespeople who are more relational-selling oriented are less likely to promote the use of e-commerce channels—especially if a customer has a negative attitude toward e-commerce or if competitors are focused on personal selling. With these findings, our study helps managers improve their salespeople’s essential role as promoters of e-commerce channels.}

Still, current empirical research does not yet provide ample evidence on how a firm's strategic posture towards digitalization connects to environmental performance. This study examines the link between digital orientation and environmental performance as well as the moderating role of technological turbulence. The natural-resource-based view and literature on strategic orientations provide the conceptual foundations. The hypotheses are tested with data from 515 U.S. Standard and Poor's 500 companies with 2,800 firm observations from 2009 to 2019. The results indicate that, first, a firm's digital orientation has a significant and positive effect on environmental performance and, second, this effect is even more pronounced in technologically turbulent business environments. In sum, our findings suggest that managers can improve their firm's environmental performance and competitive position by increasing the digital orientation within their organizations. We thus add to the literature on the natural-resource-based view by identifying digital orientation as a strategy aligned with the natural environment. Finally, we derive practical implications for managers and policymakers aiming to bring together digitalization and green strategies.}

The evidence reflects that, although in the countries under study the access to these techniques is not clearly regulated, general principles derived from the fundamental rights declared by each country make it possible to safeguard taxpayers’ right to access this information.}

Multiple interactions with the search engine are required, and session search comes into being. Currently proposed session search methods still cannot take advantage of interactive information to capture the user’s implicit information needs. Recently, quantum theory has been successively applied into information retrieval task. We find the similarities between quantum measurements and session interactions. This paper thus develops a Quantum Interactive Retrieval Model (QIRM), which involves both quantum standard measurement (QSM) and quantum weak measurement (QWM) to re-characterize the user’s cognition shifts during a session interaction. Particularly, the user’s cognition states in strong interaction and weak interaction are quantified into quantum-like representations formalized by QSM and QWM, respectively. The representations are then viewed as the user’s information needs for computing ranking score of an evaluated document. We conduct experiments on TREC 2013 and 2014 Session Track datasets. The empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed methods, which obtains very comparable performance in terms of nDCG@10 and ERR@10.}

Previous research efforts mainly focus on capturing sequential transitions between consecutive items via recurrent neural networks (RNN) or modeling the complex transitions between non-adjacent items based on graph neural networks (GNN). Although these works have achieved encouraging performance on solving the session-based recommendation problem, few efforts have been dedicated to exploring the rich information related to the shifts of user interests within the transition relationships, which is the research gap we attempt to bridge in this work. In this paper, we propose a novel model, named Time Enhanced Graph Neural Networks (TE-GNN), which attempts to capture the complex user interest shift patterns within sessions. In TE-GNN, we construct a Time Enhanced Session Graph (TES-Graph) where transition relationships between items are treated adaptively with respect to the degree of user interest drift. In addition, a novel Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (T-GCN) is designed to learn item embeddings based on the TES-Graph. Moreover, we also introduce a Temporal Interest Attention Network (TIAN) to model the complex transition of items with a common user interest. Extensive experiments have been conducted on four widely used benchmark datasets, i.e., Diginetica, Tmall, Nowplaying, and Retailrocket, and the results show that our proposed approach TE-GNN significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline methods. The implementation of TE-GNN is available in https://github.com/GuTang1997/TE-GNN.}

Given the gaps, the study aimed a) to explore the challenges in platform-provider relations, and b) to investigate the provider's perspective on platforms' responses to negative incidents in such relations. Using 510 responses from ridesharing providers, the structural equation modelling analysis of the challenges in relations showed that perceived information asymmetry, uncertain working conditions and relational opportunism predict dissatisfaction with platforms and a subsequent feeling of job insecurity. Latent class analysis based on the providers' perceptions of platforms' responses to negative work incidents resulted in three clusters of respondents. Those clusters had a significant variance in the perception of proactive, passive and defensive responses, and the job satisfaction level following the implementation of those responses. These findings contribute to the literature on stakeholder relations in the sharing economy and the organisational/psychological climate by extending knowledge about platform-provider relationship dynamics in digitally-mediated work environments. Managerial implications are also discussed in the paper.}

abstract = {The matrix factorization model based on user-item rating data has been widely studied and applied in recommender systems. However, data sparsity, the cold-start problem, and poor explainability have restricted its performance. Textual reviews usually contain rich information about items’ features and users’ sentiments and preferences, which can solve the problem of insufficient information from only user ratings. However, most recommendation algorithms that take sentiment analysis of review texts into account are either fine- or coarse-grained, but not both, leading to uncertain accuracy and comprehensiveness regarding user preference. This study proposes a deep learning recommendation model (i.e., DeepCGSR) that integrates textual review sentiments and the rating matrix. DeepCGSR uses the review sets of users and items as a corpus to perform cross-grained sentiment analysis by combining fine- and coarse-grained levels to extract sentiment feature vectors for users and items. Deep learning technology is used to map between the extracted feature vector and latent factor through the rating-based matrix factorization model and obtain deep, nonlinear features to predict the user's rating of an item. Iterative experiments on e-commerce datasets from Amazon show that DeepCGSR consistently outperforms the recommendation models LFM, SVD++, DeepCoNN, TOPICMF, and NARRE. Overall, comparing with other recommendation models, the DeepCGSR model demonstrated improved evaluation results by 14.113% over LFM, 13.786% over SVD++, 9.920% over TOPICMF, 5.122% over DeepCoNN, and 2.765% over NARRE. Meanwhile, the DeepCGSR has great potential in fixing the overfitting and cold-start problems. Built upon previous studies and findings, the DeepCGSR is the state of the art, moving the design and development of the recommendation algorithms forward with improved recommendation accuracy.}

The aim of this study is to analyse the dynamics in the behavioural heterogeneity of (new) multichannel supermarket customers when the online channel is introduced. A Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was conducted on 1151 adopters of the new online channel of a supermarket retailer to segment customers. We employed an extended “Recency, Frequency and Monetary (RFM)” model that includes customers’ purchases prior to the introduction of the new channel. Results show that adopters of a new channel are not a homogenous group of customers displaying a similar behaviour: two segments – or 35% of the sample – quit the channel after using it for some time, another segment (5%) left the company altogether, the other four segments remained multichannel to different degrees, with one shifting shopping substantially to online. Based on these results, the paper provides directions to retailers for developing Customer Relationship Management (CRM) strategies to manage the different customer segments and support channel performance evaluation and channel management decisions in a multichannel context.}

This study developed a theoretical framework based on attribution theory and employed the partial least squares–structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method to analyze the value co-creation process. The results indicate that SMM positively impacts brand loyalty (BL), brand trust (BT), and VCC. Furthermore, BT positively affects BL and VCC, while also serving as a positive mediator between SMM and BL and VCC. Finally, BL positively enhances the VCC intentions of fashion brand consumers.

Data was analyzed using structural equation modelling (SEM), while examining associations between variables in male and female samples separately. First, when using an equality of means test, we show that females exhibit significantly higher levels of CCI, perceived risk, homophily, and prosocial orientation, as well as significantly lower levels of self-efficacy. Second, when using a between-group analysis comparing unstandardized betas, we observe that: (1) self-efficacy has stronger effects on CCI in males; (2) homophily has stronger effects on CCI in females; (3) prosocial orientation's effect on CCI does not differ between genders; (4) a stronger effect of susceptibility to social influence on CCI in females is partially evident; and surprisingly, (5) perceived risk has a stronger negative effect on CCI in males.

Traditionally, customer churn prediction was dependent on binary classifiers, which are often optimized for accuracy-based performance measures. However, there is a growing consensus that this approach may not always fulfill the critical business objective of profit maximization, as it overlooks the costs of misclassification and the benefits of accurate classification. This study adopts extreme gradient boosting trees to predict profit-driven customer churn. The class weights and other hyperparameters of these trees are optimized using Bayesian methods based on the profit maximization criterion. Empirical analyses are conducted using real datasets obtained from service providers in multiple markets. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model yields significantly higher profits than the benchmark models. Bayesian optimization and adjustment of class weights contributed to enhanced model profitability. Furthermore, when optimizing multiple hyperparameters, the computational cost of model optimization is significantly reduced compared with an exhaustive grid search. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model through a sensitivity analysis employing Bayesian optimization. Using the proposed model, marketing managers can design targeted marketing plans to retain customer groups with a higher likelihood of churning.}

However, for non-ingested products (e.g., dishwashing liquid), contamination inferences are observed for store messiness but not for human crowding. Further, role of perceived scarcity is examined which suggests that in ingestible product category perception of scarcity can mitigate the negative effect of contamination on purchase intention.}

abstract = {This paper offers a legal perspective on the phenomenon of shadow banning: content moderation sanctions which are undetectable to those affected. Drawing on recent social science research, it connects current concerns about shadow banning to novel visibility management techniques in content moderation, such as delisting and demotion. Conventional moderation techniques such as outright content removal or account suspension can be observed by those affected, but these new visibility often cannot. This lends newfound significance to the legal question of moderation transparency rights. The EU Digital Services Act (DSA) is analysed in this light, as the first major legislation to regulate transparency of visibility remedies. In effect, its due process framework prohibits shadow banning with only limited exceptions. In doing so, the DSA surfaces tensions between two competing models for content moderation: as rule-bound administration or as adversarial security conflict. I discuss possible interpretations and trade-offs for this regime, and then turn to a more fundamental problem: how to define visibility reduction as a category of content moderation actions. The concept of visibility reduction or ‘demotions’ is central to both the shadow banning imaginary and to the DSA's safeguards, but its meaning is far from straightforward. Responding to claims that demotion is entirely relative, and therefore not actionable as a category of content moderation sanctions, I show how visibility reduction can still be regulated when defined as ex post adjustments to engagement-based relevance scores. Still, regulating demotion in this way will not cover all exercises of ranking power, since it manifests not only in individual cases of moderation but also through structural acts of content curation; not just by reducing visibility, but by producing visibility.}

Although extant research has examined the generation of NWOM because of consumers’ negative consumption experience, little is known about the role of fans of rival brands in spreading NWOM of a focal brand and how the focal brand can mitigate this rival NWOM transmission. This research aims to investigate why fans who highly identify with rival brands are willing to transmit the focal brands’ NWOM and how the focal brand can mitigate the NWOM transmission. Through four studies comprising two surveys and two experiments, this article shows that consumers’ identification with rival brands leads to the NWOM transmission of focal brands, and that schadenfreude mediates the effect. Furthermore, NWOM transmission can be attenuated when the focal brand has responded to the original NWOM in an empathic way. This study enriches the word-of-mouth literature and offers important managerial implications.}

abstract = {Session-based recommendation aims to predict next item based on users’ anonymous behavior sequence within a short time. Recent studies focus on modeling sequential dependencies or complex relations among items in a session via recurrent/convolutional/graph neural networks. However, the following problems still remain: for short sessions, limited interactions cannot manifest user’s intent clearly; for long sessions, user’s interest may drift but be blurred by complex transitions. Motivated by the observation that different items are often belong to only a few categories or that closely related, in this article, we tackle these challenges by leveraging item category information, which is a concise form of knowledge and readily available in many platforms. We propose a novel method CaSe4SR that utilizes category sequence graph to augment session-based recommendation. In CaSe4SR, we build an item graph and a category graph, from user behavior sequence and item category sequence. The latter summarizes the former at concept level, which reduces item-level user behavior noises and makes user’s interest clearer. Afterwards, graph neural networks are applied on item graph and category graph respectively to learn representations of items and categories. Then two alternative fusion strategies and attention mechanism are designed to integrate them, yielding global embedding of the session, which is further combined with representation of last item to get ultimate session representation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that CaSe4SR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods consistently. Detailed analysis reveals that category sequence graph is beneficial for next-item recommendation in sessions with different lengths.}

abstract = {Implicit feedback such as clicks and favorites has been widely studied and applied to recommender systems due to its low collection cost and rich hidden information. In this paper, the recommendation based on implicit feedback of multiple behaviors is formalized into a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, and an online recommendation model based on MAB is proposed. In the model, we use item categories as arms, rather than using items as arms in existing related models, so that the number of arms can be fixed and the scale can be controlled, thereby avoiding computational complexity. Such a design can also increase the diversity of recommendations. In addition, we divide the implicit feedback into strong interaction, weak interaction, and non-interaction to calculate user preferences more accurately. Almost all recommendation models face two important challenges, namely the cold start problem and the exploration & exploitation (EE) problem. In our model, a differentiated recommendation strategy is put forward to alleviate the cold start problem and a bandit learning algorithm based on Thompson sampling is proposed to balance the EE problem by making the expected reward of each arm subject to an independent beta distribution and using multi-behavior implicit feedback to update the posterior distribution. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed model on three public datasets, and discussed the factors that affect the model, as well as its robustness in the cold start environment.}

Instant delivery markets are complex and dynamic systems influenced by highly random demand. Conventional bidding strategies require perfect market information and cannot be adjusted effectively according to the evolution of requests. To address this problem, this paper proposes an auction-based trading platform to enable freight transportation procurement and develops a Reinforcement Learning (RL) enabled dynamic bidding strategy to optimize carrier’s behavior in sequential auctions. In the RL enabled dynamic bidding strategy, three RL algorithms, including Q-learning, Deep Q Network and experience replay based Q-learning are used to improve carrier’s bidding ability. The simulation results demonstrate that compared with the conventional bidding strategy, the RL enabled dynamic bidding strategies with any of the three RL algorithms can help carrier secure more auctions and gain more profit in a competitive marketplace. In addition, the advantages of the RL enabled dynamic bidding strategies are more obvious and the performance is more stable in more uncertain market environments.}

Its sheer numbers, together with social and environmental sustainability concerns, and the move towards digitalization of customer-centric operations, make the fashion business a prime target for Decision Support Systems (DSSs). On the other hand, decision support in fashion retail is particularly problematic and embraces all major supply chain domains. Decisions in an online fashion retail supply chain (FRSC) are highly dependent on time-varying customers' preferences and product availability, often leading to a combinatorial explosion. To address such a problem, DSSs could greatly benefit from high-quality information stored in customer models (CMs), constructed by using Artificial Intelligence techniques, allowing informed decisions on how to personalize (adapt) to match the customer's needs and preferences. Combinations of CMs with recommender systems (RSs) have been increasingly utilized in fashion e-commerce to provide personalized product recommendations. Nevertheless, works on enhancing CMs for e-commerce or other decision-making chain domains are scanty. This paper offers a systematic review of the literature on fashion CMs with applications to decision-making in FRSCs, mining topics for a research agenda. Research on the theme is relevant and urgent for the fashion business, which is still in its infancy. Work on the agenda topics could benefit distinct fashion stakeholders, not just customers, and produce well-grounded decision-making in varied FRSC contexts and dynamics.}

How to optimally design coupon strategies to achieve the coordination between the product merchant and platform has become critical in platform supply chain management. This paper studies a platform-led coupon distribution problem and analyzes the optimal strategies of the platform and merchant: who bears the coupon cost and how many coupons should be offered. We propose a Stackelberg game in which the platform acts as the leader and decides the coupon denomination. Then, the merchant, as the follower, decides the product's selling price. Consumers are divided into high-frequency and low-frequency consumers according to their heterogeneity in consumption frequency. Our analysis shows that when the platform bears the cost, under the combined effect of the highest denomination and the highest product selling price, the platform and the merchant can realize coupon cooperation under the supply-adequate strategy, which means the number of coupons can satisfy the shopping frequency of all consumers. When the merchant bears the cost, the platform still tends to distribute more coupons. However, the merchant will suffer due to the losses caused by the coupon costs. To reach coupon cooperation, the platform can give up the excessive exploitation of the merchant by adjusting the coupon denomination.}

The data are collected in Taipei, Taiwan. The findings suggest the inhibiting and promoting roles of permission-triggered privacy concerns and social presence, respectively, in explaining variations in the consumer receptiveness of relationship programs. Moreover, innovation security, which includes perceived risk and technology anxiety, as well as frugality are confirmed to contribute to the increase in privacy concerns. Also, social presence is proven to mitigate the effect of innovation security on privacy concerns.}

Survey data obtained from 252 healthcare end users was analysed using the ADANCO software version 2.0.1. The results derived from this empirical study support the observation that explorative and exploitative processes mediate the relationship between an ambidexterity context and the utilisation of telemedicine technology. Prior research has revealed that it is fundamentally important for organisations to be able to exploit and explore external sources of knowledge. However, for the uptake of telemedicine technologies, there has been limited research that aids in developing an adequate framework to analyse the role played by explorative and exploitative learning processes with patients. In order to address this issue, this study is done from the point of view of either home health patients or their carers. This paper supports the use of an ambidexterity context that facilitates an environment where effective balance between explorative and exploitative learning processes is likely to improve the patients’ levels of utilisation of telemedicine technology.}

At the same time, online sales have put to the test the enforcement of traditional VAT/GST rules, thus resulting in a higher risk of tax evasion and fraud. These types of risk are mainly associated with the qualification of taxable persons, the nature of transactions (C2C or B2C) and imports of low-value goods. The OECD has recently highlighted the potential role that platforms can play in the effective enforcement of VAT/GST rules in the e-commerce context. The OECD suggests the possibility to make e-commerce marketplaces liable for the VAT/GST on sales made through their platforms and other measures such as data sharing and enhanced co-operation between tax authorities and online marketplaces. However, even before the release of this OECD report States around the world had already started to consider how to involve platforms in the effective VAT/GST enforcement. A comparative analysis of the legislations adopted in the UK, Germany, Australia and of the EU VAT e-commerce package aims at individuating which are the main benefits and limits of such new provisions. As it emerges, even if there is room for improvement, provisions strengthening the role of platforms for VAT/GST enforcement are in any case a valuable measure for States to adopt in order to create a level playing field for businesses and protect States’ revenue.}

Neural topic models have been proposed and have great performance in extracting interpretable latent topics and representations of texts. However, there remain two major limitations: (1) these methods generally ignore the contextual information of texts and have limited feature representation ability due to the shallow feed-forward network architecture, (2) Sparsity of the representations in topic semantic space is ignored. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a semantic reinforcement neural variational sparse topic model (SR-NSTM) towards explainable and sparse latent text representation learning. Compared with existing neural topic models, SR-NSTM models the generative process of texts with probabilistic distributions parameterized with neural networks and incorporates Bi-directional LSTM to embed contextual information at the document level. It achieves sparse posterior representations over documents and words with zero-mean Laplace distribution and topics with sparsemax. Moreover, we propose a supervised extension of SR-NSTM via adding the max-margin posterior regularization to tackle the supervised tasks. The neural variational inference method is utilized to learn our models efficiently. Experimental results on Web Snippets, 20Newsgroups, BBC, and Biomedical datasets demonstrate that the contextual information and revisiting generative process can improve the performance, leading to the competitive performance of our models in learning coherent topics and explainable sparse representations for texts.}

We conduct a multiple case study analysis, interviewing 28 individuals across nine companies. Our investigation uncovers a hierarchy of intertwined affordances facilitating supply chain information management, cooperation, and customer-focused solutions. Significantly, we highlight the unique influence of technology, organization, and environmental (TOE) factors in shaping affordance actualization.

Our work advances technology affordance research by explaining affordance actualization within supply chains and highlighting the dynamic interplay between TOE factors and BA affordance actualization. Subsequently, our research offers a nuanced understanding of BA implementation, demonstrating how tailored BA strategies can enhance supply chain optimization, cooperation, and customer-centric solutions, ultimately driving value creation for supply chains.}

abstract = {Order picking is one of the most demanding activities in many warehouses in terms of capital and labor. In parts-to-picker systems, automated vehicles or cranes bring the parts to a human picker. The storage assignment policy, the assignment of products to the storage locations, influences order picking efficiency. Commonly used storage assignment policies, such as full turnover-based and class-based storage, only consider the frequency at which each product has been requested but ignore information on the frequency at which products are ordered jointly, known as product affinity. Warehouses can use product affinity to make informed decisions and assign multiple correlated products to the same inventory “pod” to reduce retrieval time. Existing affinity-based assignments sequentially cluster products with high affinity and assign the clusters to storage locations. We propose an integrated cluster allocation (ICA) policy to minimize the retrieval time of parts-to-picker systems based on both product turnover and affinity obtained from historical customer orders. We formulate a mathematical model that can solve small instances and develop a greedy construction heuristic for solving large instances. The ICA storage policy can reduce total retrieval time by up to 40% compared to full turnover-based storage and class-based policies. The model is validated using a real warehouse dataset and tested against uncertainties in customer demand and for different travel time models.}

Moreover, by examining the interrelationship between innovation and digital technologies we unveil situations where the simultaneous introduction of certain types of innovations with specific digital tools further enhances sales growth and other instances where rigidities arise that impair sales growth. This study furthers our understanding of whether and how innovation, digital technologies, and their interaction, enable firms to positively respond to the challenges of exogenous shocks.}

Fashion consumers are faced with a tradeoff between price and seasonality of fashion items as discounts are used to sell last season's stock. We find that private label choice is positively influenced by price orientation and less by discount proneness. Thus, private label shoppers are rather a fashion savvy segment focusing on buying more in season but at a lower price.}

As a response, many governments have introduced mandatory notification schemes in which an entity bears an obligation to notify the regulator and affected individuals if personal data it holds is compromised. Focusing on Australia’s Notifiable Data Breach (NDB) scheme introduced in 2018, this paper points out that the NDB scheme gives entities that should be responsible for data protection much leeway while holding individuals, only victims of a data breach, responsible for dealing with the consequences. This is problematic as redressing the grievances caused by a data breach is difficult in the Australian context. It is difficult for a victim of a breach of privacy to bring an action in court mainly because there is no established tort of privacy in Australia. Further, bringing a class action for data breaches is a difficult process. We suggest that the real effect of the NDB scheme requires an understanding in a broader context of Australian Privacy Principles (APPs). Regulated in a broader APPs context, the NDB scheme could become a part of a privacy protection regime that requires public agencies and businesses to have better accountability and responsibility mechanisms.}

Drawing upon the S-O-R framework, we propose a model that explains the intention to reuse AR-based apps. The results of a study involving 224 participants suggest that the relationship between perceived augmentation and consumers’ behavioural intention is fostered by a mediation pattern combining three interrelated cognitive factors, namely, sense of immersion, product presence and perceived realism. The results reveal the importance of perceived realism to encourage adoption of this means of shopping by creating a favourable attitude towards mobile shopping, which, in turn, convinces consumers to reuse such shopping apps.}

To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel Context-aware Graph Embedding Network (CGENet) with gate and attention mechanisms, that not only can effectively exploit the collaborative relationship between the sequence and transition patterns in each session, but also benefit greatly from topological context patterns among different sessions. Specifically, the proposed CGENet consists of three different parts, i.e., Transition Pattern Learning (TPL) module, Sequential Pattern Learning (SPL) module, and Context Pattern Learning (CPL) module. The TPL module is built on Graph Isomorphic Network (GIN) with multiple information highways to capture the transition relationships between items. To maximize the value of sequence-position information, a Gated Multilayer Perceptron (gMLP) is introduced into the SPL module to model the long-term dependencies between sequence tokens. Under the standardized guidance of the graph attention layer, the CPL module can further explore the topological contexts from neighboring sessions, thereby enhancing its ability to predict user preferences more effectively. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CGENet compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.}

It reaches into basic online activities, such as linking. Departing from well-established international approaches, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has recently decided a multitude of cases that redesigned the notion of communication to the public in the Internet, while discussing linking activities in particular. This jurisprudence stands against a fluid legal framework searching for the optimal allocation of intermediary liability of information service providers. Communication to the public is at the centre stage of this legislative process as well. EU copyright legislative reform makes Online Content Sharing Service Providers (OCSSP)—the large majority of UGC platforms—communicating to the public. In doing so, the Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive changes the fundamental rules under which online platforms operate and UGC content is created for a large portion of the connected world. This, in turn, is forcing online intermediaries to remodel the architecture of the Internet accordingly. Proactive filtering—rather than ex post review of allegedly infringing content and links—is set to become the first commandment governing the Internet of tomorrow.}

This study is positioned in the emerging research on the cognitive individual microfoundations of Entrepreneurship and Strategy, and contributes to the discussion of how business models are used as heuristics, in the novel and relevant setting of Digital Entrepreneurship. We conducted a multiple case study on three digital startups that applied the emerging Lean Startup Approaches (LSAs) and embody technological development in their value proposition. We found that digital entrepreneurs applying LSAs as a systematic process to validate their business ideas rely on business models as cognitive lenses to make sense of LSAs and translate abstract guidelines into fast and frugal heuristics, in order to ‘make do’ with cognitive resource scarcity. These BM-generated heuristics in turn help entrepreneurs in the activities of: (i) making sense of entrepreneurial opportunities; (ii) formulating falsifiable hypotheses concerning their startups’ viability; (iii) filtering, selecting and organizing fuzzy and incomplete external and internal information; (iv) designing multidimensional customer experiments and tests revolving around the notion of value, through Minimum Viable Business Models (MVBMs); (v) prioritizing these experiments and tests to validate their early BM through analogical arguments; and (vi) processing the learning they obtain from experiments, and concretizing it in the form of BM pivots. We also provide empirically-driven insight on an integrative set of cognitive processes – namely (1) cognitive imprinting, (2) common language transfer; (3) attention intensity and (4) scientific and experimental cognition – that mold and blend together the BM-generated heuristics and explain how they are learnt, transferred, enacted, and how they persistently enable a cognitive transition to the application of a scientific method to Entrepreneurship based on more sophisticated experiments and metrics.}

We study how script readers decide which of several different scripts to use during systems analysis and design tasks. We carried out a free-simulation experiment to test how users select scripts based on two factors: combined ontological completeness and ontological overlap. We find that participants indeed decided to select more than one script to achieve a more complete domain representation. But, when they selected more than three scripts, they decided to remove scripts and reduce combined completeness to increase the clarity of the combined representation. Our results indicate that script readers prefer relatively less complete scripts with high levels of clarity over more complete, but more overlapping, script combinations. We detail the implications these findings have for the theory and the practice of conceptual modeling.}

Our work investigates a retailer’s optimal strategy for sharing demand information with a manufacturer who may collaborate with a streamer to build a live-streaming selling channel. The results indicate that the manufacturer’s live-streaming selling channel expansion via an influencer does not necessarily harm the retailer because the retailer can free ride on the market expansion due to the social influence of the streamer. We also provide a rationale for the widespread voluntary information sharing observed in the era of live-streaming selling. The retailer can discourage or encourage the manufacturer to establish a live-streaming channel by sharing the demand information, which depends on the streamer’s social influence. In addition, potential changes to the information sharing policy result in several unexpected profit implications for the manufacturer, whose profit exhibits a nonmonotonic relationship to the streamer’s social influence and the channel expansion cost. In other words, our results counterintuitively show that the manufacturer may suffer from cooperating with a highly influential streamer in a live-streaming channel but benefit from choosing a less influential one.}

Experiments are conducted on both synthetic dataset and industrial dataset. The results show that our method outperforms most of the current uplift modeling approaches in responsive customer targeting and effective treatment attribution, achieving an area under uplift curve (AUUC) of 0.590 and a Qini-coefficient of 0.080.

This problem is widely recognized as the exploration/exploitation (EE) dilemma, and the multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithm has proven to be an effective solution. As the scale of users and items in real-world application scenarios increases, their purchase interactions become sparser. Then three issues need to be investigated when building MAB-based recommender systems. First, large-scale users and sparse interactions increase the difficulty of user preference mining. Second, traditional bandits model items as arms and cannot deal with ever-growing items effectively. Third, widely used Bernoulli-based reward mechanisms only feedback 0 or 1, ignoring rich implicit feedback such as behaviors like click and add-to-cart. To address these problems, we propose an algorithm named Dynamic Clustering based Contextual Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandits (DC3MAB), which consists of three configurable key components. Specifically, a dynamic user clustering strategy enables different users in the same cluster to cooperate in estimating the expected rewards of arms. A dynamic item partitioning approach based on collaborative filtering significantly reduces the scale of arms and produces a recommendation list instead of one item to provide diversity. In addition, a multi-class reward mechanism based on fine-grained implicit feedback helps better capture user preferences. Extensive empirical experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DC3MAB over state-of-the-art bandits (On average, +75.8% in F1 and +54.3% in cumulative reward).

Significant tensions tend to arise across this gap. However, the data-driven experimentation, and the organizational capabilities developed within the firm, increase the ability of the company to foster technological forecasting and business model innovation. It is argued within this paper, that growth hacking actually mitigates these tensions. This paper is a critical review complemented with insights from practitioners and an illustrative case, the purpose of which is to: a) shed light on what growth hacking is; b) give practical tips on how to implement growth hacking. In achieving the first goal, the paper unravels the following myths. First, growth hacking is not a framework for platforms and high-tech companies only. Second, it is not only a marketing strategy and third, that growth hacking is a predefined process. These issues are traced back to two flawed assumptions underlying growth hacking; namely that (a) it is a framework designed for start-ups only and (b) that a “one size fits all” approach to growth hacking is appropriate. By unravelling those issues and combining these observations we shall provide ground for a fundamentally different approach to growth hacking, designed for business model scalability, enabled for adaptability in a changing business environment and focused throughout on the effective management of a firm's resources and capabilities. These insights shall guide scholars towards a better understanding of the phenomenon and of the two waves that characterize its evolution, providing also promising future research avenues. Moreover, the implications drawn from the discussion shall help managers in guiding their journey from strategy definition to strategy implementation.}

However, the following challenges need to be addressed: (1) the hierarchy of item transition patterns is overlooked; (2) existing works fail to distinguish various factors of item transition within a single session for disentangling user intents. To cope with the above challenges, we propose a novel session based recommendation model called Self-supervised Dual Hypergraph learning with Intent Disentanglement model (SDHID). Specifically, we first propose a disentangled capsule hypergraph convolutional channel for ne-grained intent learning to capture the intra-session pattern. Accordingly, we introduce the hypergraph and capsule networks in disentangling to learn the item embedding for different factors, and then the representation of the intra-session pattern is obtained by aggregating item embedding with attention weights. Moreover, we build a novel dual–primal hypergraph convolutional channel by mapping the hypergraph to a dual–primal graph for learning the item transition pattern of inter-session. In addition, the above two channels are combined into a self-supervised contrastive learning framework by maximizing mutual information between the learned session representations. We unify the recommendation and the self-supervised tasks under a primary and auxiliary learning framework. The combined optimization of two tasks leads to a hierarchical joint learning item transition for intra- and inter-session. Extensive experiments on real datasets show that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art models.}

The findings are derived from a single case study relying on 33 interviews, field visits, a workshop and secondary data. The article is grounded in Industrial Network Theory and particularly the Resource Interaction Approach, which enables an analysis of how air as a resource can be disembedded from e-commerce parcels. The results offer insights for firms involved in e-commerce supply chains into various actors' perspectives on air in e-commerce parcels and how firms can start tackling the challenge of reducing it. The paper concludes that even though excessive air in parcels has received much attention lately, this problem is not always highly prioritised and only one of many considerations for firms.}

We conduct an empirical study using a clothing dataset collected from a major fashion product website in China. After differentiating photos' foreground and background and generating features using machine learning, we apply a hierarchical Bayesian model and find that consumers prefer clothing products to be shown on a darker and simpler background. The product should be located in the center of the photo with a slight horizontal offset. It is preferable to use a blurred background and reduce the use of human model faces. These findings are of substantial theoretical and practical value to e-commerce.}

abstract = {Recently, online shopping has turned into a mainstream means for users to purchase as well as consume with the upsurge development of Internet technology. User satisfaction can be improved effectively by doing Sentiment Analysis (SA) of a large quantity of user reviews on e-commerce platforms. It is still challenging to envisage the accurate sentiment polarities of the user reviews because of the changes in sequence length, textual order, along with complicated logic. This paper proposes a new optimized Machine Learning (ML) algorithm called the Local Search Improvised Bat Algorithm based Elman Neural Network (LSIBA-ENN) for the SA of online product reviews. The proposed work of SA encompasses ‘4’ major steps: i) Data Collection (DC), ii) preprocessing, iii) Features Extraction (FE) or Term Weighting (TW), Feature Selection (FS), and polarity or Sentiment Classifications (SC). Initially, the Web Scrapping Tool (WST) is utilized to extract the customer reviews of the products for which the data is gathered as of the E-commerce websites. Next, preprocessing is carried out on the web scrap extracted data. Those preprocessed data go through TW and FS for additional processing by means of Log Term Frequency-based Modified Inverse Class Frequency (LTF-MICF) and Hybrid Mutation based Earth Warm Algorithm (HMEWA). Lastly, the HM-EWA data is rendered to the LSIBA-ENN, which classifies the customer reviews’ sentiment as positive, negative, and neutral. For the performance analysis of the proposed and prevailing classifiers, ‘2’ yardstick datasets are taken. The outcomes exhibit that the LSIBA-ENN attains the best performance in SC when weighted against the existing top-notch algorithms. The observations of the reviewer are exact. The prevailing ENN proffers recall of 87.79 when utilizing the proposed LTF-MICF scheme, whereas ENN only achieve 83.55, 84.03, 85.48, and 86.04 of recall whilst utilizing W2V, TF, TF-IDF, and TF-DFS schemes respectively.}

To address this challenge, we conduct an exploratory qualitative study based on 20 interviews with providers and customers of cloud computing services, supplemented by data from observations. Our research highlights critical touchpoints along the customer journey in cloud computing markets and provides implications for B2B customer journey management. A key finding is that B2B customers' IT competency is a crucial differentiator in this market. That is, while IT-savvy companies evaluate these services independently and use them in a self-service fashion, IT-novice companies rely on multipliers (e.g., IT system houses) to act as support and gatekeepers to buying cloud computing services. This difference has implications for the composition of buying and usage centers, the development of the customer journey, and the control of touchpoints by the service provider. Thus, cloud service providers need to manage two types of customer journey: one directly focused on customers and another involving the management of multipliers. Based on these findings, we offer recommendations for B2B practitioners to guide their customers through the journey for this complex digital service.}

Cluster analysis is an essential technique in unsupervised machine learning. Object-clustering cannot be determined without determining similarities between objects in the set and searching for clusters with the most significant internal consistency and external separatory. Therefore, we need knowledge about which measure behaves similarly and which differs depending on the nature of the analyzed data. According to our knowledge, there is no such research in the literature. In research, we analyzed six different measures for eight different datasets (differing in size and data type). The results say, among others, which measures take the longest time for calculations and which are the most correlated with others, so they can be used interchangeably without fear of losing valuable information about the mutual similarity of objects.}

However, whether sustainable consumption prompts more social value-oriented behaviors outside the consumption domain remains uncertain. The increased availability of consumer-level big data presents an opportunity to investigate consumers’ cross-domain behavior subsequent to sustainable consumption, which broadens the comprehension of sustainable consumption by going beyond the boundary of consumption behavior. Supported by a joint dataset comprising information on both consumers’ consumption behavior and their microloan repayment behavior, this study examines the effects of sustainable consumption on consumers’ subsequent debt default behavior to empirically test the cross-domain spillover effects of sustainable consumption behavior. The results suggest that the default probability of green consumers overall was 4.34 % lower than that of nongreen consumers, even though this positive effect on repayment disappears when sustainable consumption is for health reasons. The findings contribute to research on sustainable consumption by providing empirical evidence indicating that sustainable consumption has positive spillover effects in other domains. The results also provide an alternative perspective for identifying high-quality borrowers for microloan platforms.}

As a follower, the manufacturer decides the quality level and sales quantity based on the information he holds. Considering the retailer’s flexibility in acquisition timing, we focus on two formats, namely committed acquisition and contingent acquisition, depending on whether the retailer commits to her acquisition decision before or after the manufacturer’s quality investment. Assuming the manufacturer provides identical product through different selling channels, we find that when the manufacturer’s direct selling efficiency is high, contingent acquisition is always a weakly dominant strategy, while the retailer is suggested to commit to acquire information if and only if the direct selling efficiency is low and the acquisition cost is relatively high. If the consumer quality preference is acquired, information sharing occurs only when the direct selling efficiency is sufficiently high, via which the retailer can induce a lower expected wholesale price, gain a higher market share, and achieve a “win-win” situation. With the information advantage, the retailer can always obtain a positive profit in the distribution channel, while the inefficient manufacturer may stop selling in the direct channel when consumers have a low preference for quality. Our result explains why, despite manufacturers directly obtain profits from their own channels, they still sell products through retail channels and even treat them as main distributive ways. Based on the above equilibrium outcomes, we derive the retailer’s optimal strategy for information management, whereby the retailer can not only induce the highest product quality, but also the highest consumer surplus as compared to other acquisition strategies. Our work can guide retailers to better implement information strategies when confronting manufacturer encroachment.}

Through six studies, we show that larger brand logos are preferred by low-power (vs. high-power) consumers when an independent self-construal is salient because of a greater tendency to engage in self-deceptive enhancement—the tendency to see oneself in exaggerated and glorified terms. In contrast, a smaller brand logo is preferred by low-power (vs. high-power) consumers when an interdependent self-construal is salient because of a greater tendency to engage in impression management—the tendency to be modest and normatively appropriate. These findings provide meaningful insights for managers in terms of logo size decisions and marketing communications.}

Consequently, more and more logistics service providers (LSP) are moving toward establishing more distribution centres in customers' vicinity within metropolitan areas to ensure fast deliveries to online shoppers and reduce costs. Such LSP seeks to optimize the design of their multi-echelon distribution systems by finding the best satellite locations and vehicle routing solutions. However, since satellites have limited parking and no storage spaces, synchronizing the vehicles' arrival times at these facilities and minimizing their waiting times to be loaded/unloaded are essential in designing multi-echelon distribution systems. This study proposes a new Two Echelons Location Routing problem (2E-LRP) model that incorporates vehicles' temporal synchronization at satellites through minimization and setting of a maximum duration to the second echelon vehicle's waiting times, which had not until now been dealt with in 2E-LRP literature. The 2E-LRP new extension is called Two-Echelon Capacitated Location Routing Problem with Vehicles Synchronization (2E-CLRPVS), and the Binary Variable Fixing (BVF) method is proposed to solve it. To assess the validity and applicability of the 2E-CLRPVS model and the efficiency and robustness of the proposed solving method, we conducted computational experiments for a network with up to 99 customers and 5 five satellites based on data from the Great Montreal area in Canada. We also conducted an extensive sensitivity analysis of some critical parameters of the problem to provide some interesting managerial insights regarding multi-echelon urban distribution network design decision-making.}

Advanced information technology and vast amounts of consumer data have empowered online retail platforms to share demand information with manufacturers, which can motivate manufacturers to improve product quality. However, the double marginalization effect is potentially exacerbated. Considering quality distrust, this paper develops a multi-stage game-theoretical model to study the interplay between blockchain adoption and information sharing strategy. The analysis not only investigates the dependence of the interplay on the quality cost coefficient and the unit cost of blockchain adoption, but also endeavors to determine the equilibrium strategy combination of blockchain adoption and information sharing. The findings indicate that blockchain adoption can alleviate the double marginalization effect and improve product quality conditionally. Additionally, irrespective of the level of consumers trust, the manufacturer exhibits a propensity to embrace blockchain technology. This adoption of blockchain has the potential to incentivize the online platform to share demand information under certain conditions. Several extended modelling analyses are conducted to check the robustness of the main model and additional insights are obtained.}

The purpose of this study is to develop a model of the antecedents of consumers value co-creation intentions at SEPs and evaluate it empirically.

Ethical perceptions also influence consumers' trust, satisfaction and commitment with the SEP. However, trust and commitment do not influence value co-creation intentions.

However, the cost advantage of these mobile technologies will not yield fruition unless the mobile channel accounts for a significant share of total transactions. In this article, we explore potential options for firms to promote usage of the mobile channel. To achieve this, we propose a hidden Markov model to both model customers’ decisions and assess different managerial strategies through simulations. While we apply our proposed model to data from a leading financial institution, our approach is equally applicable to other retail settings. The results show that customers’ choices of services and channels are sensitive to process time by type of channel. A 10% increase in process time through non-mobile channels leads to a nearly 14% increase in utilization of mobile banking channel. Therefore, retailing firms could potentially influence customers’ choice of different channels by changing channel-specific process times. Motivated by these findings, we present and compare performances across five different policies, in promoting the usage of mobile channel. Drawing on our simulation results, we also make personalized policy recommendations to firms facing different levels of financial constraints. For those with financial constraints, we recommend a policy of increasing process time for a selected subset of service requests through non-mobile channels. Firms not constrained by the resources might be better off improving process time with the mobile channel by targeting customers identified as having a better relationship with the firm.}

As a result, many retailers take various return leniency measures to ease the applicability of product returns for customers, which increases the frequency of returns in the market and has huge economic impacts on retailers. Therefore, it is necessary to accurately understand the impact of return leniency on both retailers’ profit and consumers’ welfare to outline return leniency strategies wisely and maximize profit and social welfare. We present a comprehensive model considering the impacts of major factors influencing customer behavior, such as return leniency, customer heterogeneity, and the endowment effect, in addition to the other frequently researched aspects in the literature (i.e., product expenses, hassle cost, salvage value). Our model calculates the probability of purchasing, keeping, and returning products to demonstrate the impact of return leniency, determining the optimal price and refund levels to optimize the retailer’s expected profit and the consumer’s loss, and optimizing social welfare. We use a set of numerical experiments over a wide range of parameter values that could cover almost all practical circumstances. Among other findings, our analysis shows that return leniency can be beneficial or detrimental to the retailer depending on the product acquisition cost, endowment effect, and product salvage value, which usually increases social welfare up to some level.}

abstract = {We consider an e-commerce retailer who must ship orders from a warehouse to a set of customers with delivery deadlines. As is often the case, the retailer uses a third-party service provider to ensure its distribution. The retailer can enter the supply chain of the service provider at various levels. Entering it at a higher level entails lower sorting costs for the retailer, but higher delivery costs, and longer delivery times. The customer orders arrive at various moments over a rolling planning horizon. This means that the retailer must also make consolidation decisions. We model and solve the static and dynamic cases of this problem. The static case is modeled as an integer linear program and solved by CPLEX. We develop and compare four shipping policies for the dynamic case. Extensive computational results based on real location data from California and Texas are reported.}

The latter has significantly grown during the last two decades, with further amplifications during the COVID-19 pandemic. This has created operational and policy making challenges for firms when deciding about how best to manage the resulting growth in e-commerce. While the impact of e-commerce on supply chains has been widely recognized in the literature, there was no effort to systematically review the literature, conceptualize some of the challenges and propose future research directions. This paper fills this gap by reviewing 153 publications from 1999 to 2019. We classify the reviewed literature based on which supply chain drivers were investigated, as well as, the employed research methodology. In addition, we conduct network and content analysis to uncover the main research themes and potential research directions namely, developing analytical centred; modelling based ecosystem for environment; leveraging data mining to enhance sustainability; balance between growth and sustainability; consumer demand and uncertainty; coordination in e-commerce logistics; last mile alternatives and cost management of innovative technique implementations. Furthermore, based on our literature review, we propose a conceptual framework where we interlink supply chain stages with a firm’s business strategy, digital transformation strategy and performance.}

Using a game-theoretic framework, we examine how an authentic luxury brand, observing the strategic behavior of its competing copycats, should make its optimal entry decision to a third-party online marketplace. Our findings reveal that the authentic luxury brand does not sell on the online marketplace when either the quality or the physical resemblance of the copycat to the authentic luxury brand is high. This contributes to the related literature by offering an explanation for the increasing quality of copycats amid the e-commerce boom —improving the quality of the copycat can deter the authentic luxury brand from selling on the online marketplace. Furthermore, by comparing our equilibrium outcome with the benchmark case where the authentic luxury brand does not consider selling on the online marketplace at all, we show that the authentic luxury brand’s potential entry to the online marketplace is sufficient to induce the copycat to improve its quality and lower its price, thereby improving the aggregate consumer surplus. In addition, the online marketplace can always be better off allowing the entry of the copycat if there is no external enforcement against copycats. We show that our key results are valid in various extensions and they offer multiple managerial implications.}

This study investigates the determinants of customer satisfaction with curated subscription services across different subscription box categories based on expectation disconfirmation theory. Sentiment analysis technology is conducted to extract customers’ attribute-level experiences from 22,551 customer reviews associated with 676 subscription boxes. Results show that sentiment toward utilitarian and hedonic attributes of products and services is positively associated with customer satisfaction, with the sentiment toward hedonic attributes exerting a stronger influence on satisfaction compared to utilitarian attributes. Findings also indicate that subscription time and information disclosure moderate the relationship between sentiment toward hedonic and utilitarian attributes and customer satisfaction. This study enriches theoretical research on customer satisfaction, offers insights into consumer behavioral research in subscription retailing, and provides implications for managers to attract more subscribers to the curated service.}

Simultaneously, the data and insights that can inform consumer attitudes and behaviors often reside outside of firms' direct control. Consciously incorporating these interdependent factors into firms' decision-making is essential for adaptability and sustainable profitability. Building on the “outside-in” perspective, we propose that firm strategies should be informed through the lens of the marketing ecosystem that considers the interrelated and dynamic megatrends. By leveraging advances in data and technology, firms can sense-make the marketplace by extracting insights from massive amounts of diverse consumer data with modern-day analytics. By mapping out the megatrends with marketing analytics, firms can 1) more accurately predict consumers' changing preferences and formulate appropriate strategies to engage with them; and 2) become more market-adaptable and competitive in the present and the future. To deliver sustainably compelling value to customers, firms should adopt an ecosystem mindset and cooperate with various stakeholders. A broad-thinking, agile, and humble firm culture can enable the development of more robust outside-in capabilities. We elaborate on the megatrends in the interconnected world of the marketing ecosystem, and propose emerging research directions in each area.}

Consumers order or purchase goods in two stages including advance selling and regular selling, based on their offline and online market segmentations. This study employs a Stackelberg game approach to characterize centralized and decentralized models considering market segmentation and price discounts. We find that the manufacturer can obtain maximum equilibrium profit in advance selling by indirectly and purposefully guiding lock-in consumers in regular selling to purchase goods through the offline market, and subsequently can avoid minimum equilibrium profit in regular selling by directly and purposefully guiding lock-in consumers in regular selling to purchase goods through the offline market. However, the retailer can obtain the maximum equilibrium profits in both stages. Furthermore, for exogenous price discounts, the manufacturer and retailer formulate pricing strategies that adhere to existing market rules. For endogenous price discounts, pursuing a low price-discount strategy should be avoided. Cooperation between both players can always generate more profits under regular selling, but not under advance selling. A two-part tariff contract is proposed to achieve cooperation. The results show that by adjusting a lump-sum fee, players can smoothly implement the two-part tariff contract. Three extensions demonstrate that cannibalizing discount-sensitive consumers does not always result in higher profits for the manufacturer or retailer.}

Synchromodal transportation, as an extension of intermodal transportation, refers to transport systems with dynamic updating of plans by incorporating real-time information. The trend towards spot markets and digitalization in hinterland intermodal transportation gives rise to online synchromodal transportation problems. This paper investigates a dynamic shipment matching problem in which a centralized platform provides online matches between shipment requests and transport services. We propose a rolling horizon approach to handle newly arrived shipment requests and develop a heuristic algorithm to generate timely solutions at each decision epoch. The experiment results demonstrate the solution accuracy and computational efficiency of the heuristic algorithm in comparison to an exact algorithm. The proposed rolling horizon approach outperforms a greedy approach from practice in total costs under various scenarios of the system.}

This study addresses the intercity express transportation network optimization problem (IETNP), which integrates the hub location problem with the multi-commodity flow problem. An integer linear programming model is introduced to represent the IETNP. To leverage the decomposable structure of the IETNP model, an improved Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm is developed for solving the IETNP. A novel dual decomposition strategy is proposed to mitigate the negative effects of numerous coupling constraints on achieving high-quality upper-bound solutions. This strategy, incorporating penalty-term-reduction and multiplier-replacement methods, diminishes the number of penalty terms and the search space, thus enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining solution quality. A Lagrangian relaxation (LR)-based algorithm is employed to generate lower-bound solutions that assess the quality of the upper-bound solutions. Auxiliary constraints are integrated into the dualized formulation to enhance these lower-bound solutions. The effectiveness and efficiency of the improved ADMM-based algorithm are validated using over 100 artificial instances with 10–500 nodes and a realistic instance involving 338 cities. Comparative analysis with an off-the-shelf solver and existing ADMM- and LR-based algorithms reveals that the improved ADMM-based algorithm reduced the upper-bound values by 11.44% on average and by up to 22.09%.}

The research on technology in society considers specifically which enablers and obstacles are most prominent in driving the digitalization of complex B2B sales processes. This research applies a post-positivism approach based on a qualitative design, using insights from case studies. Data collection is based on an in-depth series of interviews with salespeople in several companies, in order to collect information about the digitalization of complex B2B sales processes. Findings indicate that a complex B2B sales process is not easily digitalized. On the contrary, there are a number of hurdles to overcome. General results reported contextualize the major specific one, while the specific ones focus on enablers and obstacles in complex B2B sales processes. The research aids our understanding of the process of obtaining valid information in this context. It also helps to classify and organize different kinds of analog and digital sources and channels of information. Provides suggestions for further research. This study proposes using a mixed structure in the sales department to obtain benefits of communication technologies and to use what advantages digitalization provides. This may start by dividing digitalization process into functions and after that, using the remaining possibilities, by territory, accounts or products, depending on the company. The study reveals dimensions (indicators and context) and sub-dimensions (organizational, technological, cultural and security issues) of relevance in the digitalization of complex B2B sales process.}

abstract = {In e-commerce, customers are usually offered a menu of home delivery time windows of which they need to select exactly one, even though at least some customers may be more flexible. To exploit the flexibility of such customers, we propose to introduce flexible delivery time slots, defined as any combination of such regular time windows (not necessarily adjacent). In selecting a flexible time slot (out of a set of windows that form the flexible product), the customer agrees to be informed only shortly prior to the dispatching of the delivery vehicle in which regular time window the goods will arrive. In return for providing this flexibility, the company may offer the customer a reduced delivery charge and/or highlight the environmental benefits. Our framework also can accommodate customized flexible slots where customers can self-select a set of regular slots in which a delivery may take place. The vehicle routing problem (VRP) in the presence of flexible time slots bookings corresponds to a VRP with multiple time windows. We build on literature on demand management and vehicle routing for attended home delivery, as well as on flexible products. These two concepts have not yet been combined, and indeed the results from the flexible products literature do not carry over directly because future expected vehicle routing implications need to be taken into account. The main methodological contribution is the development of a tractable linear programming formulation that links demand management decisions and routing cost implications, whilst accounting for customer choice behavior. The output of this linear program provides information on the (approximate) opportunity cost associated with specific orders and informs a tractable dynamic pricing policy for regular and flexible slots. Numerical experiments, based on realistically-sized scenarios, indicate that expected profit may increase significantly depending on demand intensity when adding flexible slots rather than using only regular slots.}

Previous personalized recommendation methods identify user preferences by analyzing historical purchase data. As the user preferences reflected in the user–item matrix take only two values: like or dislike, the binary purchase data-based method is too constrained to capture individual diverse opinions and user preferences evolution. Despite the fact that online search queries explicitly express consumers’ content preferences for product attributes, very little research has focused on inferring user preferences from online queries. To this end, this study proposes a novel temporal recommendation method based on estimating consumers’ dynamic preferences from their search queries. Our approach involves: first, proposing a temporal topic model that utilizes a Markov process to predict users’ potential interests, and then integrating customer preferences and product attribute features into a unified product ranking model to obtain personalized and diversified product lists. Empirical analysis shows that the proposed approach can better capture the temporal dynamics of customer preferences drift and can more accurately predict consumer purchase intentions. Furthermore, products recommended by the proposed approach not only better match individual preferences, but also cover more diverse content topics.}

This paper presents a review of the literature on the interaction between e-commerce and offline retailing, highlighting empirical findings and generalizable insights, and discussing their managerial implications. Our review includes studies published in more than 50 different academic journals spanning various disciplines from the inception of the internet to present. We organize our paper around three main research questions. First, what is the relationship between online and offline retail channels including competition and complementarity between online and offline sellers as well as online and offline channels of an omnichannel retailer? Under this question we also try to understand the impact of e-commerce on market structure and what factors impact the intensity of competition /complementarity. Second, what is the impact of e-commerce on consumer behavior? We specifically investigate how e-commerce has impacted consumer search, its implications for price dispersion, and user generated content. Third, how has e-commerce impacted retailers’ key managerial decisions? The key research questions under this heading include: (i) What is the impact of big data on retailing? (ii) What is the impact of digitization on retailer outcomes? (iii) What is the impact of e-commerce on sales concentration? (iv) What is the impact of e-commerce and platforms on pricing? And (v) How should retailers manage product returns across online and offline channels? Under each section, we also develop detailed recommendations for future research which we hope will inspire continued interest in this domain.}

Considering e-tailers’ broader question of how best to counteract these marketplaces, we consider three of online sales modes, namely, the traditional, consignment, and in-marketplace selling modes. In particular, we investigate the interaction between a supplier’s strategy for introducing a marketplace channel and an e-tailer’s choice of selling mode. Our analysis reveals that the e-tailer’s selling mode choice depends not only on the performance of both the supplier and the marketplace but also channel competition. In general, the e-tailer prefers the in-marketplace selling mode with a higher marketplace service level and the consignment mode with higher supplier selling efficiency. If a marketplace channel exists, traditional reselling is a better choice when both the marketplace service level and the supplier selling efficiency are restricted to the middle range. The underlying mechanism is that traditional reselling is less negatively affected by the competition effect. Finally, we find that the supplier wants to eschew the marketplace channel and strategically induce the e-tailer to sell through it even though the marketplace service level is relatively high. This research provides guidance not only for the supplier’s channel choice but also for the small- and medium-sized e-tailers’ choice of selling mode when encountering the online marketplace.}

By relying on an exploratory approach and by conducting in-depth case studies of three high-profile firms – Alibaba (AliExpress), Tencent (WeChat) and ByteDance (TikTok), the research provides rich insights into such expansion, and more specifically, an understanding of their motives, strategies and challenges. The research contributes to the limited literature on the internationalization of Chinese service firms. While largely affirming the literature on internationalization, the multiple case study approach adopted provides rich granular insights into the distinctive motives, strategies and challenges that Chinese Internet firms can face in the European market. It identifies particular nuances that are easily missed in studies based on secondary data. In particular, two clearly distinct processes of internationalization in Europe emerge. While existing work on the internationalization of Chinese Internet firms has mostly regarded them as a cohesive and homogeneous set of companies, our findings suggest that we are dealing with two different sets of companies whose approaches toward internationalization seem to be radically different, revealing two tales of internationalization. From the findings it emerges that differently from the Internet firms that started to internationalize earlier as part of a “first wave” of internationalization, the firms that started to internationalize later as a part of a “second wave” have done so, with a significant speedier pace by also adopting a bolder internationalization strategy that shares some common features with the first movers but that also displays a remarkably higher level of sophistication. Significantly, this type of firm does not seem to suffer from any liability of any kind.}

This paper analyses two types of potential legal influences on these national laws: standards and obligations originating from outside Africa (international); and those developed within Africa, both at the continental (African Union) level, and at the level of Regional Economic Communities (RECs). Analysis commences with which countries have laws or Bills, and constitutional requirements International influences are shown to be indirect, with only slight UN influences, but with accessions by African countries to data protection Convention 108 significant in converting it into a global Convention. EU influences are also indirect (aspirational) with both the DPD and the GDPR perceived as standards to be emulated in African instruments. Of African multilateral agreements, the African Union's data protection and cybercrime Convention (2014) is yet of limited influence because it is not in force. In contrast, the ECOWAS Supplementary Act (2010) has been of considerable practical influence in West Africa. The HIPPSA ‘Model Acts’ with higher standards (particularly SADC Model Law, 2013) remain of potential influence in other regions of sub-Saharan Africa. European instruments are presented as typifying ‘three generations’ of development of data privacy laws (exemplified by (i) Convention 108, 1980; (ii) EU DPD, 1995; and (iii) EU GDPR, 2016 plus Convention 108+, 2018). The three main African multilateral instruments (ECOWAS Act, AU Convention, SADC Model Law) are compared with them, as well as between themselves. These comparisons enable conclusions to be drawn, some of which are as follows. The African regional framework does not display any Africa-specific approach to data protection. Less individualist and more communitarian African culture or human rights discourse is absent from the texts of these laws. Drafters of the African instruments seem to accept, tacitly or expressly the necessity to be consistent with other international texts, in particular European instruments. They have adopted many ‘2nd generation’ DPD elements but have anticipated relatively few of the ‘third generation’ GDPR standards. Sub-regional agreements (ECOWAS Act and model laws) have provided a means to move forward despite the lack of progress in bring the regional AU convention into force.}

abstract = {The fast-paced growth of e-commerce is impacting the type and variety of products consumers purchase across channels. A commonly held theory, known as long tail theory, posits that online sales are less concentrated at the top of the sales distribution than offline sales, and that more variety is bought online, making the tails of the overall sales distribution denser with the growth of e-commerce. Most of the literature testing the long tail theory has focused on examining entertainment goods markets that do not require much physical examination, and has predominantly found results consistent with the theory. However, the magnitude and antecedents of the observed long tail effects might be different for product categories containing products that require more physical examination before purchase, such as fashion goods. In this study, using detailed individual and transaction level panel data from two multichannel fashion goods retail brands, we show that while the shift to the online channel results in a decrease in the concentration of overall sales for both brands, this change mostly results from consumers buying different products online rather than consumers buying a greater variety online compared to offline. We show that the flattening of the overall sales distribution with the growth of e-commerce in our data is driven by consumers sorting their purchases into channels based on product characteristics. In contrast to the recommendations from the previous long tail literature, our results show that fashion apparel retailers do not need to offer broader assortments online compared to offline, but they may find it profitable to carry or emphasize a different product mix online compared to offline. Our results also provide guidance to fashion goods retailers in curating their online and offline assortments and setting inventory management strategies across the channels.}

The study used an online survey of 163 Chinese customers and a pride-inducing methodology to investigate how pride in purchasing pro-environmental technology could lead to positive spillovers. A Partial Least Squares approach to Structural Equation Modelling was used to analyse the results. Feelings of pride elicited by the intentions to purchase the novel technology positively affect subsequent behaviours of reducing energy consumption by other means (same domain), as well as recycling and reusing materials (different domain). Pride appeals can be leveraged by social businesses as by definition they focus on the social good and, according to our findings, pride-inducing messages enhance the impacts of the pro-environmental technology adoption. Such spillovers can be beneficial to society, thus allowing social businesses to satisfy social and financial goals at the same time.}

Consumers vary in their degree of preference match with firms’ products; the higher preference mismatch, the longer a consumer searches online seeking a better matching alternative. Firms can infer consumers’ preferences based on their digital footprints during their online search and customize their reminder advertising campaign. The default strategy is to pursue all website visitors with a uniform reminder advertising campaign.

This paper focuses on two challenges traditional GNN frameworks face: (i) most of them are transductive and mainly concentrate on homogeneous networks considering single typed nodes and edges; (ii) they are difficult to handle the real-time changing network structures as well as scale to big graph data. To address these issues, a novel attention-based Heterogeneous Multi-view Graph Neural Network (aHMGNN) solution is introduced. aHMGNN models a more intricate heterogeneous multi-view network, where various node and edge types co-exist and each of these objects also contain specific attributes. It is end-to-end, and two stages are designed for node embeddings learning and multi-typed node and edge representations fusion, respectively. Experimental studies on large-scale spam detection and link prediction tasks clearly verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed aHMGNN. Furthermore, we have implemented our approach in one of the largest e-commerce platforms which further verifies that aHMGNN is arguably promising and scalable in real-world applications.}

The social commerce platform operates a virtual community using two strategies: a competition strategy whereby the social commerce platform attracts and engages consumers through its virtual community, leading them to directly purchase products from its e-commerce channel, and a cooperation strategy whereby the social commerce platform integrates links to the traditional platform’s online channel within its community. We fully characterize the optimal decisions and corresponding profits and consumer surplus under each strategy. Our findings indicate that while platforms increase prices in a market with full coverage, they (weakly) decrease them in a market with partial coverage if consumer unit travel costs increase. Additionally, we explain how the revenue-sharing rate and spillover effect of a virtual community affect the cooperation strategy and discover that they have a nonmonotonic impact on the effort level of the social commerce platform. Importantly, we show that when the downstream market is partially covered, the cooperation strategy could result in a win-win-win situation for platforms, consumers, and social welfare. When the downstream market is fully covered, however, the cooperation strategy may result in a lose-win-lose, lose-win-win, or lose-lose-win situation for the social commerce platform, traditional platform, and consumers. Implementing the cooperation strategy might reduce social welfare. We also consider three extensions – sequential pricing, the traditional platform investing in its own virtual community, and a cooperation strategy with cost sharing – to check the robustness of the main results.}

Most advanced GNN-based recommendation methods (e.g., LESSR, SGNN-HN and GCE-GNN) focus on how to either capture long-range dependencies or use global context information to enhance the recommendation performance. However, these approaches do not consider whether they can enhance each other and cooperatively improve performance. In addition, these methods mainly take the representation of the last interacted item as current interest, ignoring the potential information in other recent interactions and neighbor sessions. To solve these issues, we propose a model called LDGC-SR to integrate Long-range Dependencies and Global Context information for Session-based Recommendation. LDGC-SR employs normalization and adaptive weight fusion mechanism (NAWFM) to integrate long-range node information and global context information to alleviate the over-smooth problem of item representation and the over-fitting problem of the model. NAWFM can reduce the numerical bias between long-range dependencies and global context information, and dynamically adjust their importance to the user’s preference. Moreover, LDGC-SR employs a global context enhanced short-term memory module (GCE-SMM) to capture the user’s current interest more accurately and incorporate it as an auxiliary task. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art methods on all four public datasets, and provide suggestions for future session-based recommendation systems.}

We examine the strategic interactions among manufacturer encroachment, platform dual-purpose concern, and retail competition. Some interesting results are obtained. First, with a single platform, the manufacturer's encroachment incentive exhibits a non-monotonic relationship with respect to the platforms' concern of consumer surplus. However, with multiple competing platforms, the increased concern of consumer surplus and retail competition intensity dampen the manufacturer's encroachment incentive. Second, manufacturer encroachment benefits platforms (supply chain) only when the platform's concern of consumer surplus is low and commission fee is moderate (low enough). Moreover, the increased retail competition intensity and the platform's concern of consumer surplus further aggravate the detrimental effect of manufacturer encroachment on the platforms and supply chain. Third, the dual-purpose concern of the platforms may hurt consumer surplus, whereas the increased retail competition intensity may contrarily alleviate this adverse effect to some extent. Finally, the profits for the platform and supply chain and consumer surplus are non-monotonic with respect to the platform's concern of consumer surplus.}

Building on Social Exchange theory, we suggest that interactions between users and RAs are driven by the concepts of perceived interdependence and reciprocity. We suggest that perceived user effort decreases the perceived RA quality, whereas RA effort increases the perceived RA quality. We conducted two experimental studies across different contexts. We found that users evaluate RAs based on their own expended effort, in relation to how much effort they perceived the RA has put into the process of generating recommendations. Such an effect is attenuated by users’ familiarity with the product context. Our findings offer important insights into how online firms can improve the use of their RAs.}

However, this perspective overlooks the impact of C2C-PE on the knockoff trading, a noticeable challenge the fashion brands is encountering. Taking a fresh perspective, we argue that C2C-PE can encourage knockoff customers to purchase original products because of the additional product exchange value. To validate this argument, we construct analytical models to explore the impacts of C2C-PE on the members of the fashion supply chain and the consumers. By comparing between the cases with C2C-PE and without C2C-PE, we theoretically find that the presence of C2C-PE benefits the original supply chain, its members and the consumers, while harms the knockoff supply chain, its members and the consumers. The findings are robust when considering: (i) strategic quality decision; (ii) price dependent C2C-PE utility and (iii) consumers’ conspicuous behavior. Managerial implications and future research agenda are discussed.}

Blockchain Technologies promised to bring about decentralized trust having the potential to disrupt digital ecosystems by providing alternatives to centralized storage and management of data. This has the potential to radically transform industries and services through new models of data storage, transparency, tracking, payment systems amongst other advantages. However, Blockchain Technology is designed to provide other Value Propositions beyond decentralized storage, such as innovative crypto economic and investment models and radical new forms of decentralized participative governance models that could lead to the evolution of new generation of Digital Platforms and multi stakeholder business interactions. In this paper, through a systematic literature review, we present a set of key Blockchain Value Propositions and a discussion on how it can complement to the evolution of Digital Platforms and the Collaborative Economy. We also argue that while some of the value propositions are easier to integrate with existing Digital Platforms, more disruptive value propositions such as Business Automation, Economic and Governance Models present greater challenges but could lead to not just innovation at the technological level, but also metamorphosis of the existing social, economic and governance models.}

A huge number of items are reviewed and rated by consumers on a daily basis, and managers have a keen interest in real-time monitoring of this information to improve decision-making. The main challenge is to mine reliable textual consumer opinions, and automatically use them to rate the best products or brands. We propose a framework to automatically analyse these reviews, transforming negative and positive user opinions in a quantitative score. Sentiment analysis was employed to analyse online reviews on Amazon. The Fake Review Detection Framework—FRDF— detects and removes fake reviews using Natural Language Processing technology. The FRDF was tested on reviews of products from high-tech industries. Brands were rated according to consumer sentiment. The findings demonstrate that brand managers and consumers would find this tool useful, in combination with the 5-Star score, for more comprehensive decision-making. For instance, the FRDF ranks the best products by price alongside their respective sentiment value and the 5-Star score.}

By utilizing the data of additional reviews (ARs), an innovative social media module for customers to express follow-up opinions that complement their initial reviews, we examine the impact of MR treatment on the customers' AR valence. We leverage the insight that the observability of MR at the time of the responded customer posts an AR is a crucial condition to the impact of the MR, and thus regard the observability of MR as an exogenous treatment for model identification. Fixed effects models with extensive control variables are proposed to estimate the MR treatment effects. The results show that MRs have significant positive impacts on customers' satisfaction in ARs. Further explorations show that the positive impacts are mainly due to the positive effects of MRs on nonpositive initial reviews (MR-Ns), suggesting that MR-Ns are an effective management tool for customer complaints. Moreover, this study identifies MR delay as a boundary condition for the internality of MRs because MR delay negatively moderates the positive impacts of MRs. Therefore, companies should promptly respond to customers' negative opinions in their reviews. This study is among the very first to clearly identify the internality of MRs on the responded customers’ satisfaction. We show that the existing results on the externality of MRs are not directly applicable to the internality of MRs, highlighting the novelty of this study. The obtained new insights provide practical guidelines for companies to adjust their intervention strategies on e-commerce platforms.}

Notwithstanding recent research on freight trip generation, other components of commercial traffic, such as commercial service traffic, have been largely overlooked. This is ironic, as the service sector represents a major and growing portion of urban and metropolitan economies. The research reported in this paper intends to help fill an important research gap through analyses of unique survey data collected by the authors. To this effect, the research comprehensively characterizes service visits to commercial establishments—in terms of frequency, purpose, duration, time of day, and other characteristics—by industry sector for two metropolitan areas. In addition, the authors estimated econometric models that express the number of service trips to commercial establishments as a function of the economic characteristics of the establishment and assessed the geographic transferability of the models obtained. To gain insight into the overall magnitude of service-related traffic, the models were applied to publicly available data to estimate the service activity in American cities of various sizes. The resulting service traffic are then used to estimate of parking requirements of service and freight vehicles for the most congested ZIP codes at these cities. The paper ends with a discussion of chief findings and policy implications.}

Most of the existing frameworks, be it Matrix Factorisation model, Deep learning-based model, Factorisation Machines and Two tower recommendation models, used in real world recommendation engines lack diversity and serendipity. Also, cold start problem is one that downgrade the recommendation algorithm. Defining the optimisation goal and closed feedback improvement loop is also something that is not given primary weightage. To overcome the above stated challenges and provide a novel approach to overcome those, we propose the AFETLER model. AFETLER incorporates an adaptive fusion technique that dynamically combines recommendations from several sources such as new arrivals forecast, Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, and popularity estimation. This fusion technique improves accuracy by giving varying weights to each source based on the user's context, history preferences, and current behaviour, resulting in highly relevant and tailored buying recommendations. To address the cold-start problem and improve recommendations for new items, AFETLER employs a transfer learning mechanism inspired by the Adversarial Two-tower Neural Network (ATNN) framework, utilizing knowledge from existing items' interactions to extract valuable features from new items' profiles. Furthermore, AFETLER leverages hierarchical attention methods to effectively capture user-item interaction patterns, boosting feature extraction and overall recommendation quality through dynamic weighing of interaction relevance. Proposed AFETLER model outperforms some of the existing recommendation models by an average 2%-5% on metrics such a precision, ROC-AUC, and Top-K recommendation accuracy. Further, we also see point reduction in Mean absolute error and mean squared error.}

Eight hundred and fifty-eight users of various fitness apps have responded to the questionnaire. Results show that people who are open to changing their fitness systems from traditional to app-based services enjoy new experiences and new product behaviours. For them, the perceived functional barriers to service adoption don't hold them back. At the same time the users of fitness apps try to get health and fitness information from as many sources as possible, like friends, peer groups, the newspaper and social networking apps. Users with a high level of health consciousness are more likely to be active in their health and fitness. People who use apps make decisions based on new information from the integrated model. App providers should think about how to get and keep users interested in their apps, personalise their experience, and design features that make users invested in the apps.}

One reason behind this problem is that venues generally permit customers, of varying group size, to freely choose seats, and thus causing a sub-optimal seating allocation with sparsely stranded single seats. Due to the experiential attribute of live entertainment, ticket requests are predominantly groups wishing sets of contiguous seats. Consequently, the sparse single seats remain unsold. To solve this operational problem we analyze a capacity based revenue management control problem that explicitly accounts for group size and customer choice. We formulate the problem as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process with the objective to maximize total expected profit. Each period, and for a given arriving group size, the manager decides which price-differentiated segments to make available. Given the offered segments, customers select seats from a particular segment or choose not to purchase any. We discuss three selection models and provide algorithms to determine the optimal solution for each. Motivated by ad hoc provisions observed in practice and due to the curse of dimensionality we provide and analyze via simulation a heuristic. Finally, based on transactional sales data from a large annual North American sporting event we showcase how the model parameters can empirically be estimated.}

Despite the gloom and doom hearsay about how electronic commerce is threatening the existence of brick-and-mortar stores, by some indications, however, webrooming (i.e., the practice of researching items online, and then buying them offline) may be an even more common practice among shoppers. Against this background, this study proposes and empirically validates a comprehensive research model which incorporates consumer traits (i.e., need for touch, need for interaction, and price-comparison orientation), channel-related factors (i.e., online search convenience, perceived usefulness of online reviews, perceived helpfulness of in-store salespeople, and perceived risk of buying online), and smart shopping perception as antecedents of webrooming intention. Moreover, this study examines the moderating role of product category in predicting webrooming intention. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted. A total of 280 useable responses was collected and data was analyzed using partial least square structural equation modeling. The findings revealed significant direct and/or indirect effects (through smart shopping perception) of consumer traits and channel-related factors on webrooming intention. In addition, product category was found to moderate the relationship between price-comparison orientation, online search convenience, perceived risk, and webrooming intention. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.}

abstract = {Information on lower bounds plays an important role in the development of exact and heuristic methods for stochastic service network design (SSND). In this paper, we consider the Lagrange dual problem of SSND for computing lower bounds. The Lagrange dual problem is obtained by introducing scenario bundling into scenario-wise decomposition of the SSND model and dualizing the non-anticipativity constraints in a Lagrangian fashion. Our theoretical analysis establishes the superiority of the resulting optimal Lagrange dual bound over that in the case of scenario-wise decomposition. The Lagrange dual problem is solved from the primal perspective by employing the recently proposed FW-PH algorithm, which combines Progressive Hedging with a Frank-Wolfe-like method. To improve the computing efficiency, scenario-wise decomposition in the FW-PH algorithm is replaced with bundle-wise decomposition, which divides the problem by scenario bundles into multiple-scenario subproblems, rather than by individual scenarios into single-scenario subproblems. Scenario bundles are constructed using Gaussian mixture models. Our convergence analysis shows that this improvement retains the desirable theoretical property of FW-PH about convergence to the optimal Lagrange dual value. Computational experiments on SSND instances demonstrate that the improved FW-PH algorithm is far superior to the basic version, providing either a dramatic saving in the run-time required to achieve convergence or a much tighter lower bound when terminated due to the time limit.}

To investigate the incentives for sharing the forecast information with or without platform encroachment, this paper establishes stylized analytical models in an e-commerce setting consisting of a manufacturer, an online platform and a third-party retailer (as a reseller). Depending on whether the online platform encroachment happens or not, we consider two different platform operation modes, namely, the mode without platform encroachment where only the third-party retailer sells products, and the mode with platform encroachment where both the online platform and the third-party retailer sell products. Our analysis shows that when the online platform does not encroach, it has no incentives to share forecast information with the manufacturer, but always has incentives to share forecast information with the third-party retailer. Interestingly, when the online platform encroaches, the online platform may share forecast information, depending on the level of substitutability between products and commission rate charged by it, either only with the third-party retailer, or with both the manufacturer and the third-party retailer, or with none of them.}

Users cooperate to produce an ever-growing, rich source of Web APIs upon which new value-added Web applications can be built. Such users often interact in order to follow, comment on, consume and compose services published by other users. In this context, Web Service discovery is a core functionality of modern registries as needed Web Services must be discovered before being consumed or composed. Many efforts to provide effective keyword-based service discovery mechanisms are based on Information Retrieval techniques as services are described using structured or unstructured textdocuments that specify the provided functionality. However, traditional techniques suffer from term-mismatch, which means that only the terms that are contained in both user queries and descriptions are exploited to perform service retrieval. Early feature learning techniques such as LSA or LDA tried to solve this problem by finding hidden or latent features in text documents. Recently, alternative feature learning based techniques such as Word Embeddings achieved state of the art results for Web Service discovery. In this paper, we propose to learn features from service descriptions by using Variational Autoencoders, a special kind of autoencoder which restricts the encoded representation to model latent variables. Autoencoders in turn are deep neural networks used for unsupervised learning of efficient codings. We train our autoencoder using a real 17 113-service dataset extracted from the ProgrammableWeb.com API social repository. We measure discovery efficacy by using both Recall and Precision metrics, achieving significant gains compared to both Word Embeddings and classic latent features modelling techniques. Also, performance-oriented experiments show that the proposed approach can be readily exploited in practice.}

Given daily updates of load information, the paths for the five deployment scenarios are adjusted using two daily updating strategies. Both strategies start with a base plan in which paths are generated based on the historic daily distribution of load dispatches during an average week. The two strategies are: (1) Option 1: re-optimization of pre-booked loads and new requests, and (2) Option 2: optimization of new requests only. The solutions of the two strategies are compared to the hindsight plan which assumes complete information of actual requests placed. The presented formulations are tested out on an industry partner’s network. Results show that the savings achieved with re-optimization (Option 1) compared to insertion (Option 2) increase with more demand variability; this outcome is consistent across all fleet mixes. When most of the loads are new arrivals, the computational time of the two approaches is comparable and insertion is less attractive than re-optimization. With daily re-optimization, most of the plan changes adjust the terminals visited by a load compared to just changing the dispatch and arrival times along the load’s path.}

The findings made it possible to conclude that the perception of reciprocity is conditioned by a feeling of social identity, ingroup comparison, procedural justice and a predisposition towards outcome maximisation. Relationship commitment is predicted by perceived reciprocity and coping mechanisms (i.e. emotion-focused and problem-focused) following reciprocity perception.

abstract = {In online retailing, in addition to the reseller channel, the marketplace channel has been favored by many e-commerce platforms and suppliers. Different from the reseller channel, the novel channel enables suppliers to obtain the pricing power of products and to have direct contact with consumers. However, due to the operation inefficiency of suppliers and the competition caused by adding a new channel, for suppliers and platforms, decisions on the establishment of the marketplace channel are more complex. In addition, logistics service, which affects the purchase behavior of online consumers and is considered the key to the success of online retailing, can be undertaken by both suppliers and platforms. Based on these considerations, this paper explores whether the supplier and the platform can come to an agreement on introducing the marketplace channel by incorporating the logistics service strategy. We find that compared with the product sales price, the level of logistics service has a stronger impact on the consumers’ channel choice. A scenario we term RE-MS (the marketplace channel is established, and the platform and the supplier serve as the logistics providers in the reseller and the marketplace channels, respectively) produces the highest level of logistics service in the reseller channel, and a scenario termed RS-MS (the marketplace channel is established, and the supplier serves as the logistics provider in both channels) generates the highest level of logistics service in the marketplace channel. The supplier is always willing to add the marketplace channel and undertake logistics business in the marketplace channel. However, for the platform, adding the marketplace channel is advantageous only when the logistics service effectiveness or the commission rate is high. Additionally, when the supplier and the platform reach a consensus on the establishment of the marketplace channel, the RE-MS strategy can realize a win–win situation.}

In addition, the moderating role of the observer’s relationship orientation is examined. Results suggest that, compared to competence-oriented messages, warmth-oriented service recovery messages are more likely to enhance observers’ service perceptions in the online environment, leading to satisfaction with service recovery efforts and positive word-of-mouth intentions (Study 1). Furthermore, relationship orientation serves as a boundary condition in the effect of service recovery strategy on observers’ service perceptions (Study 2).}

While the user acquisition and adoption of the branded app is growing exponentially, the rate of app abandonment remains an area of concern. As many as 71 % of users remain inactive within a rolling period of three months; however, limited scholarly research has occurred to understand the causal explanation of this phenomenon. This study attempts to shed light on the reasons for such a high abandonment rate, the factors triggering such behaviors, and their causal relationship through the interpretive structural modelling (ISM) approach. An extensive literature review on the branded app, studies on consumer retention, and responses from 31 domain experts led to the identification of 19 factors and the presentation of a seven-layered interpretive structure to define the underlying causal relationship between these factors. The academic contribution of this paper lies, first, in identifying four new factors (onboarding experience, acquisition offer, value for time, and gestation period) and assimilating them into the extant consumer retention research. Second, this study conceptualizes a new model by integrating two existing theories of the Investment and Relationship Stability Model and the Commitment–Trust Theory. It also aspires to improve understanding of the branded app abandonment among practitioners and accordingly helps in prioritizing their marketing interventions.}

In order to identify the conditions under which this type of cross-investment in a competitor is attractive, we develop a duopoly model with an e-tailer and a brick-and-mortar (BM) retailer, and ask when, or whether, one member of the duopoly should invest in the other. The impact of the investment decision on the duopoly’s leadership structure, prices, demands, and profits are investigated. Our study shows that the investor chooses to invest in the investee when the investee’s value is medium; the investment can weaken the price competition between the two channels, and lead to a win-win outcome. When there is no cross-channel investment, the member of the duopoly that is more efficient in selling the product should take the leadership role by setting the selling price first. When one member of the duopoly does decide to invest in the other, however, the leadership decision depends strongly on the relative initial values of the two retailers. Finally, we show that when the initial value of the investee as estimated by the investor is sufficiently low, and the customer’s degree of acceptance of the e-tailer’s channel is sufficiently high, the investor prefers to be an investment holder; otherwise, the investor prefers to receive a dividend.}

abstract = {To underpin a reverse logistics (RL) outsourcing decision, this study aims to investigate a third-party reverse logistics provider (3PRLP) selection problem under the framework of group decision making (GDM). Group attitude towards distinctive opinions may affect the time and cost on consensus reaching process (CRP). Therefore, an attitudinal consensus method under uncertainty is established and composed of three parts: initialization process, consensus process and selection process. In initialization process, considering each expert’s risk preference, a transformation rule is deployed to compute semantics possibility distribution of general comparative linguistic expressions (GCLEs) based on the numerical counterpart of linguistic assessment. In consensus process, three group attitudes-oriented consensus policies are qualitatively presented, including maximum, indifference and minimum disagreement consensus policies. Considering the feasible interval of attitudinal parameter, a new consensus measure under uncertainty, i.e., attitudinal consensus acceptability index (ACAI), is quantitively defined by stochastic acceptability analysis. To resolve the issue that the consensus degree fails to reach a predefined level, an automatic feedback mechanism is designed, and is supported by a consensus improvement algorithm evolving GCLEs’ possibility distribution. In selection process, to identify the criteria weight, incomplete information such as pairwise comparisons of criteria are characterized by ordinal regression-like linear programming. TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multiple attribute decision making) is extended on fuzzy measure and then acted as rank function in stochastic acceptability analysis to explore the uncertainty of criteria preference. Lastly, 3PRLP selection for an automobile manufacturing firm is conducted to demonstrate the flexibility and practicability of our method along with sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis.}

These markets allow users to submit feedback for downloaded apps in the form of (a) star ratings and (b) opinions in the form of text reviews. Users read these reviews in order to gain insight into the app before they buy or download it. The user opinion about the product also influences on the purchasing decisions of potential users; that in trun, plays a key role in the generation of revenue for the developers. The mobile apps can contain large volume of reviews, which make it nearly impossible for a user to skim through thousands of reviews to find the opinion of other users about the features which interest them the most. Towards this end, we propose a methodology to automatically extract the features of an app from its corresponding reviews using machine learning technique. Moreover, our proposed methodology would aid users to compare the features across multiple apps, using the sentiments, expressed in their associated reviews. The proposed methodology can be used to understand a user’s preference for a certain mobile app and could uncover the reasons why users prefer one app over another.}

It is mostly done manually by dedicated employees called pickers and is considered the most expensive of warehouse operations. To reduce the picking cost, customer orders can be grouped into batches that are then collected by traveling the shortest possible distance. This work presents an exponential linear programming formulation to tackle the joint order batching and picker routing problem. Variables, or columns, are related to the picking routes in the warehouse. Computing such routes is generally an intractable routing problem and relates to the well known traveling salesman problem (TSP). Nonetheless, the rectangular warehouse’s layouts can be used to efficiently solve the corresponding TSP and take into account in the development of an efficient subroutine, called oracle. We therefore investigate whether such an oracle allows for an effective exponential formulation. Experimented on a publicly available benchmark, the algorithm proves to be very effective. It improves many of the best known solutions and provides very strong lower bounds. Finally, this approach is applied to another industrial case to demonstrate its interest for this field of application.}

Online retailers on such platforms can actively decide whether to provide WFS services for consumers. If WFS service is offered, a WFS logo will be displayed on the product information page by the platform. Although WFS can enhance consumers’ willingness to pay, it incurs cost for online retailers and may cause more product returns due to valuation bias. This paper investigates when an online retailer on a platform should offer customers WFS, and it explores the detailed effects of WFS on the retailer, platform, customers, and society. We find that both the retailer and platform do not necessarily benefit from WFS. Although the platform can take a “hands-off” attitude towards the retailer in most cases, they may have conflicting interests while providing WFS, so we have developed a mechanism to coordinate their benefits. Our results explain why the platform develops such a WFS service system, and when it should incentivize the online retailer to offer WFS to customers. Furthermore, WFS always hurts customers when the valuation bias is small, while it may favor the society when the WFS cost is low. In extensions, we verify the robustness of our results and also get new insights. First, a small product salvage value motivates the platform to encourage the retailer to offer WFS. Second, though a larger proportion of overestimating customers always benefits the platform, it may hurt the retailer when it is less than a threshold. Finally, a larger heterogeneity in valuation increment allows the retailer to charge higher price and benefits the platform.}

One such technique is association rule mining. It finds the pattern from the transaction database to understand customer behavior. Frequent itemset mining (FIM) identifies a set of frequently purchased items together. One key drawback of FIM is that it ignores the item's importance. An item's importance plays a pivotal role in a real-world application. Therefore, it is necessary to discover the essential itemset from the transaction database that generate the high profit called the HUIM (High-Utility Itemset Mining) problem. From a transaction database, a variety of strategies can be used to find high utility itemset. The HUIM techniques that use the Utility list are recent and have better performance in terms of memory utilization and running time. The key limitation of these algorithms is performing costly utility list join operations. This paper proposes an efficient search space exploration technique to lessen the number of comparisons performed for utility list join operations. Hence, it reduces the cost of utility list join operations. In addition, the execution time of the proposed method is evaluated. Further, the same is compared with appropriate existing state-of-the-art methods. Finally, extensive experiments carried out on publicly available benchmark datasets show that the proposed support count ascending order (SCAO) based approach performs much better as oblivious to the state-of-the-art methods.}

As the upsurge of brand popularity and their social growth on social media channels, the role to analyze and investigate the competitor's behaviours on social media becomes a crucial part. By utilizing these behaviours a brand can investigate and optimize their competitive strategies in order to enhance the audience reach, improved customer acquisition and increase in overall profits. Therefore, monitoring and analyzing the social media behaviour of competitors is a cutting edge direction towards the enhancement of competitive benefits and efficiently decipher the competition. This research paper is an effort to help brands to know the insights such as the posts which are promoted compared to those which are organic. This article presents the detailed description of novel approach applied for promoted post detection problem. Promoted post detection makes use of social media data to provide insights related to brand's own and competitors posting behaviours and promotional strategies. We make use of ensemble machine learning techniques-bagging and boosting to train different weak learners and combine the results by majority voting and weighted average. We make use of a logistic regression model in stacking while combining used generalized linear model and ensemble models. Results show the 95% accuracy, 97% precision, 96.5% Recall and 97% F1 score of classification results of brand promoted posts as boosted or organic. The result unveils that ensemble technique stands out as an effective approach for social media promoted post detection.}

In many real-life applications, however, informative user profiles are not available. Instead, the system recommends by relying on the current user activities within an ongoing session, leading to the emergence of session-based recommendation methods. Among techniques used in such situations, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) present a natural choice thanks to their ability to model the order of session events and capture long-term dependencies. Recently, methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have also shown their potential in modeling session data, especially in extracting complex local patterns that are predictive of the user target. In this work, we propose a recurrent convolutional architecture that takes the advantages of both complex local features extracted by CNNs and long-term dependencies learned by RNNs from session sequences. Our model has two main layers: the lower layer consists of convolutional filters applied over consecutive session event embeddings, and the upper layer is a gated recurrent unit (GRU) RNN that takes as input the CNN’s output. This hybrid approach provides a flexible and unified network architecture for modeling various important features of session sequences. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over pure RNNs and CNNs models as well as state-of-the-art session-based recommendation methods.}

The call-to-action feature on any sponsored post or advertisement on SNS redirects the user to a linked e-commerce website that offers the product. Information cues available on the SNS are expected to influence user decision making on the linked e-commerce site. Set in the context of Facebook driven e-commerce, this study explores how likes on Facebook influence user's purchase and recommendation decisions on a linked e-commerce website. Using controlled experiments we find that a higher volume of likes on Facebook leads to a higher likelihood of purchasing and recommending a product on the linked e-commerce site. This effect is found to be mediated by the user's initial product attitude formed on Facebook. An additional analysis examining the strength of the influence reveals that the mere presence of likes is not sufficient to impact the user's decision making. In fact, a low volume of likes elicits user behavior similar to absence of likes. The influence is effective only if the number of likes is substantially high. The findings of the study add to the s-commerce literature by establishing the inter-site influence of Facebook likes on user's purchase and post-purchase decisions and providing empirical evidence of the efficacy of SNS-driven e-commerce.}

Meanwhile, Incidents like the current global pandemic have further exacerbated such a challenge by causing fluctuations in online demand for products like groceries. To address this, e-retailers can adopt third-party logistics providers (3PLs) as business partners. Specifically, this paper aims to address freight shipping fulfillment policies by considering an e-channel where an e-retailer (e.g., e-grocer) has a limited in-house shipping fleet and can hire additional shipping services from a 3PL to encounter demand volatility. We evaluate and compare two different contracts from the perspective of the e-retailer/3PL and e-channel: (1) a conventional contract in which the e-retailer hires shipping services from a 3PL in advance, but in case of not exercising units of hired service, incurs a penalty, and (2) an option contract in which the e-retailer can reserve/exercise shipping services from 3PL who decides on contract terms. We find that when e-channel demand volatility is high the option contract results in e-channel coordination, and both parties are better off. We further demonstrate that when e-channel demand volatility is low, the option contract is detrimental for the e-retailer and a profitable case for 3PL. Thus, the e-retailer prefers to participate in the conventional contract, as opposed to the priority of 3PL and e-channel.}

We study omnichannel retail operations with the implementation of ship-from-store to minimize the o-tailer’s expected total cost. At the start of each period, the o-tailer determines how much to replenish each product for each distribution center (DC), and how to allocate its inventory from DCs to different stores. At the end of each period, the o-tailer decides from which DCs and/or stores to fulfill the realized online demands. We formulate the problem as a multi-period stochastic optimization model and adopt a robust two-phase approach (RTA) to solve it. Phase 1 determines the binary replenishment decisions using a target-oriented robust optimization approach, whereas Phase 2 uses a linear decision rule to adaptively determine the replenishment, allocation, and fulfillment quantities. Numerical experiments suggest that the RTA outperforms existing approaches and can efficiently produce good-quality and robust solutions for realistic problem instances. A further sensitivity analysis explores the impacts of various system parameters on the RTA’s performance and the benefits of omnichannel fulfilment.}

Our focus is on omnichannel retailers who carry a single product category. A profit maximizing mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) is presented to determine the optimal locations and capacities of omnichannel warehouses, and the product flows from suppliers to warehouses, warehouses to the stores, and warehouses and stores to online markets. The online demand earned by the firm in each market is determined endogenously in the model as a function of the shipping time (distance) and the level of competition in the online market. Different warehouse capacities capture economies-of-scale in operating costs. To cover a wide range of different products, computational results are presented for five product categories, each considered separately, with widely differing cost characteristics. Results show that the ship-from-warehouse design generates greater profit than ship-from store for four product categories. However, the ship-from-store-and-warehouse design is better than both of the more restrictive ship-from-store or ship-from-warehouse designs, with the advantage growing as the percentage of online demand increases. Results also document increasing benefits from optimizing the number, locations and capacities of omnichannel warehouses as the demand increases. The magnitude of the profit advantage of different omnichannel designs is shown to depend strongly on the product category and percentage of demand that is online.}

To fill this gap, the paper analyzes the digital actions taken during the pandemic crisis by two large food retailers, namely Walmart and Carrefour. Covering a wide temporal interval of the pandemic evolution and reviewing multiple geographical markets, the authors interpreted the grocer's digital responses to the crisis in terms of innovation in value creation and capture mechanisms. As a result, three phases of digital BMI have been reconstructed, each characterized by specific mechanisms of value creation and capture experienced by the two grocers during the pandemic. Leveraging these findings, the paper proposes a model capable of defining how digital BMI takes place in response to crises. Results broaden theoretical knowledge and practical suggestions on digital BMI in terms of enabling factors, actionable value mechanisms, and future business opportunities.}

The approach uses a Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) to dynamically convert Node-Red applications into a compact semantic vector representation that encodes the service interfaces and the workflow in which they are embedded. By extending existing services interfaces, with a simple cognitive layer that can interpret and exchange the vectors, we show how the required services can be dynamically discovered and interconnected into the required workflow in a completely decentralized manner. The resulting system provides a convenient environment where the Node-RED front-end graphical composition tool can be used to orchestrate decentralized workflows. In this paper, we further extend this work by introducing a new dynamic VSA vector compression scheme that compresses vectors for on-the-wire communication, thereby reducing communication bandwidth while maintaining the semantic information content. This algorithm utilizes the holographic properties of the symbolic vectors to perform compression taking into consideration the number of combined vectors along with similarity bounds that determine conflict with other encoded vectors used in the same context. The resulting savings make this approach extremely efficient for discovery in service based decentralized workflows.}

abstract = {We consider a supply chain with a manufacturer selling a product to consumers through a hybrid online platform. The platform offers the manufacturer (she) two channels (agency and reselling channels) to sell her product. The literature assumes that the manufacturer can choose to sell her product through either the agency channel or the reselling channel, whereas this study expands the literature by allowing the manufacturer to sell her product through two channels, which is common in practice. Specifically, we study the manufacturer’s distribution channel decision on a hybrid platform and explore the impact of product quality on this decision. We reveal that it is not optimal for the manufacturer to sell solely through the agency channel in quantity competition. In the short run, she chooses to sell through the two channels if product quality is low and solely through the reselling channel otherwise. The manufacturer’s channel decision may benefit the platform and consumers, leading to a win-win-win outcome if the quality level is intermediate or sufficiently high. In the long run, the manufacturer can flexibly adjust product quality. Our analysis shows that if the commission rate is low, the manufacturer chooses a low-quality level and sells via both channels. Otherwise, the manufacturer chooses a high level of quality and sells solely via the reselling channel. Compared with the short-run model, if the manufacturer is efficient in manufacturing a high-quality product, the quality decision enlarges the region where she sells solely through the reselling channel and the region where the platform benefits from the channel decision. Although the quality decision narrows the region where consumers benefit from the manufacturer’s channel decision, it nonetheless enlarges the region where the win-win-win outcome occurs.}

abstract = {Many sellers offer product trials to allow consumers the option to try products before purchasing. With a product trial, a consumer may find they like a product more than expected, thus stimulating a purchase, but the opposite may be equally likely. Understanding when product trials are profitable, and optimizing the trial structure and associated pricing decisions is a complex challenge. Product trials are common in practice, yet their impact on segmentation and pricing is not well understood, particularly for a multi-product setting. For example, using the example of wine, should a vineyard offer mixed tastings spanning both red and white varietals, or have separate tastings for each, and what are the pricing implications? Product trials can be product specific or offered jointly across multiple products. We model and analyze these separate versus mixed trial structures, considering optimal fee-setting and product pricing decisions and the resulting consumer segmentation, in markets with heterogeneous consumers. By analyzing the relative profitability of separate and mixed trials, we develop a deeper understanding of their distinct strengths. We prove that mixed trials are preferable to separate when customers’ trials are more likely to lead to favorable product impressions, and when consumers have a low-to-moderate preference gap between the products. Our results stipulate when sellers should offer mixed tastings across product varieties, versus the alternative separate tastings, or potentially no tastings at all. We also analyze how product-trial fees should be set, as well as the impact of these trial alternatives on product pricing decisions.}

Blockchain technology applications in procurement can work as a major enabler in this process. Despite the unquestionable relevance of Blockchain Technology (BCT)-integrated Procurement, no comprehensive review exists. Considering this significant research gap, the present study aims to provide a comprehensive literature review by deeply examining 95 highly relevant papers published from January 2012 to Sep 2023. Existing literature studies suggest BCT as the imitable enabler of the Procurement 4.0 era, yet the topic has not been fully explored and researched. This study identifies noteworthy deficits in theoretical underpinnings, technological contributions in generating new revenue models, radical impacts anticipated on the procurement organization restructuring, and so forth. The research is timely and importantly advantageous because it offers a holistic view of relevant literature-driven evidence about a range of existing dimensions on the subject. More specifically, this study provides exhaustive key recommendations for future research on BCT applications in procurement utilizing the Theory, Context, and Methodology (TCM) framework.}

abstract = {Selecting an appropriate logistics mode is crucial for overseas suppliers (OSs) who enter new markets through the cross-border e-commerce platform (CEP), but it is challenging because OSs are unfamiliar with the local markets. Thus motivated, we aim at a supply chain where an OS sells its product through a CEP that holds demand information advantages, and the OS faces competition from the domestic supplier (DS). By constructing a multi-stage game model, we study the OS's logistics mode selection between direct-mail and bonded-warehouse, which has different logistics costs and inventory risks. Moreover, the influence of the CEP's information sharing decision on the logistics mode selection is investigated. Our results show that with information sharing, the OS always selects the bonded-warehouse logistics mode; while without information sharing, the OS makes a choice between direct-mail and bonded-warehouse mode according to the tax rate and market fluctuation. Particularly, under a high tax rate, with the increase in market fluctuation, the uninformed OS not only needs to adjust the logistics mode choice but also change the inventory strategy. We also reveal that information sharing could lead to the OS changing the logistics mode from direct-mail to bonded-warehouse, and then cause fierce competition between the OS and DS. Therefore, sharing information does not always benefit the CEP. Under certain conditions, it is more beneficial for the OS to choose the direct-mail mode when the information is shared, as doing so can help chain members escape the prisoner's dilemma and thus lead to a “win-win-win” outcome.}

abstract = {China is experiencing a phenomenal expansion of platform economy fuelled by the advancement of information and communication technologies. It has become a global frontrunner in many sectors, including commerce, finance, and entertainment. A comprehensive law and policy narrative, however, is largely absent from English academic literature. This paper seeks to fill this gap by analysing the dynamic relationship of industrial development, policy engagement and regulation construction in one of the prime sectors of platform economy: Electronic Commerce (E-commerce). China's E-commerce market rose to global dominance shortly after its origination in the mid-1990s. This paper holds that such an expeditious ascendency is nourished by carefully designed public policies. To implement these policies, also to redress information asymmetries and other pertinacious market failures, a tailored regulatory paradigm has been instigated. This regulatory paradigm manifests a new mode of polycentric, participatory, and collaborative governance that strives to balance interest disparities between various stakeholders. The dynamic relationship exemplified in China's E-commerce market would provide a valuable indication for administering other sectors of platform economy not only in China but also across other jurisdictions that openly embrace commercial innovations in the context of information technological transformation.}
