abstract = {Motivated by the importance of big data utilization and its impact on firm performance, the current study examines the influence of the perceived valence factors of the top management team (TMT) on the ambidexterity of big data utilization and firm performance. Despite the growing recognition of the significance of ambidexterity and the role of TMTs in leveraging big data, there remains a lack of empirical research that comprehensively examines the associations between TMT valence factors, the ambidexterity of big data utilization, and firm performance. By integrating valence theory and ambidexterity theory, this study fills this research gap and provides valuable insights into the relationship between TMT valence factors, big data utilization, and firm performance outcomes. Data were collected from 357 respondents, and the findings indicate that positive TMT valence factors – such as data proficiency, industry expertise, and knowledge diversity – as well as negative valence factors – such as data compatibility, complexity, and benefit disconfirmation – are negatively associated with ambidexterity. Furthermore, the findings of our study have important implications for organizations seeking to enhance their operational and financial performance through the effective utilization of big data. Notably, our results highlight that promoting ambidexterity in handling big data within firms results in improved operational and financial outcomes. These findings provide valuable insights into the relatively unexplored area of TMT valence factors and their impact on driving ambidexterity in big data utilization, ultimately leading to enhanced organizational performance.}

The process of Competitive Intelligence (CI) includes monitoring competitors with a view to delivering both actionable and meaningful intelligence to organizations. In this regard, the capacity to leverage and unleash the potential of big data tools and techniques is one of various significant components of successfully steering CI and ultimately infusing such valuable knowledge into CI strategies. In this paper, the authors aim to examine Big Data applications in CI processes within organizations by exploring how organizations deal with Big Data analytics, and this study provides a context for developing Big Data frameworks and process models for CI in organizations. Overall, research findings have indicated a preference for a rather centralized informal process as opposed to a clear formal structure for CI; the use of basic tools for queries, as opposed to reliance on dedicated methods such as advanced machine learning; and the existence of multiple challenges that companies currently face regarding the use of big data analytics in building organizational CI.}

Although scholars have realized the importance of applying a big data approach to HRM research, clear guidance is lacking regarding how to integrate the two. Using a clustering algorithm based on the big data research paradigm, we first conduct a bibliometric review to quantitatively assess and scientifically map the evolution of the current big data HRM literature. Based on this systematic review, we propose a general theoretical framework described as “Inductive (Prediction paradigm: Data mining/Theory building) vs. Deductive (Explanation paradigm: Theory testing)”. In this framework, we discuss potential research questions, their corresponding levels of analysis, relevant methods, data sources and software. We then summarize the general procedures for conducting big data research within HRM research. Finally, we propose a future agenda for applying big data approaches to HRM research and identify five promising HRM research topics at the micro, meso and macro levels along with three challenges and limitations that HRM scholars may face in the era of big data.}

abstract = {New energy vehicles (NEVs) such as electronic cars represent a major trend in the automobile industry, where most their exterior designs still follow those of convention fuelled vehicles (FVs). It is important to investigate whether NEV users have unique requirements that differ from those of traditional users. Kansei engineering is a practical tool for perceptual demand analysis. However, the conventional method requires questionnaires or surveys to perform limited data collection. In this study, we utilised massive internet data to collect user Kansei requirements for NEV exterior design. The Scrapy crawler was adopted for data collection and a bidirectional long short-term memory, conditional random field, and multilayer perceptron framework was developed for text mining. To quantify design features and Kansei image scores, a hybrid Apriori  + structural equation model (SEM) system is proposed, where the data-driven Apriori algorithm can explore the hidden relationships in big user generated comments, while the SEM model captures the users’ behaviour and decision procedure so that to provide interpretable results. In addition, the association rules mined from user comments by Apriori can facilitate the specification of a complicated SEM model, substantially reducing the modelling and calibration effort. Goodness-of-fit results suggest that the proposed model outperforms conventional models. A case study on 1805 automobiles, 287 brands, and 369105 comments was conducted and the results suggest that some design features that would increase the Kansei image scores for conventional FVs may have the opposite effect on NEVs. Discussions on engineering and managerial insights are presented and the discovered rules and relationships are employed to develop a design-aided system.}

With the proposed paper, we have investigated the influencing factors of AI-based chatbots from the lens of CX theories for B2B firms. In this paper, a model for organizing CX has been proposed using the diffusion of innovation theory, trust commitment theory, information systems success model, and Hoffman & Novak's flow model for the computer-mediated environment and verified using the social media data. The methodology used for this study is the social media analytics-based content analysis method (sentiment analysis, hierarchical clustering, topic modeling) for data preparation, followed by lasso and ridge regression for model verification. The results suggest that CX in B2B enterprises using chatbots is influenced by these bots' overall system design, customers' ability to use technology, and customer trust towards brand and system.}

Therefore, the gap existing between the potential of value creation embedded in the Big Data paradigm and the current limited exploitation of this value represents an area of investigation that this paper aims to explore. In particular, by following a systematic literature review, this study aims at presenting a framework that outlines the multiple value directions that the Big Data paradigm can generate for the adopting organizations. Eleven distinct value directions have been identified and then grouped in five dimensions (Informational, Transactional, Transformational, Strategic, Infrastructural Value), which constitute the pillars of the proposed framework. Finally, the framework has been also preliminarily applied in three case studies conducted within three Italian based companies operating in different industries (e-commerce, fast-moving consumer goods, and banking) in the final aim to see its applicability in real business scenarios.}

Under the context of low-carbon smart tourism empowered by big data, the impacts of big-data empowerment, consumer reference effect, channel preference, and enterprise altruistic behavior on the optimal decision making and performance of enterprises are discussed. Then, the optimal decision and performance of the firms in three decision modes (centralized, decentralized, and altruistic) are obtained with the help of differential game theory and Bellman's continuous dynamic planning theory. Our findings as follows are acquired through comparative analysis and sensitivity analysis of essential parameters. First, big-data marketing technology can personalize more low-carbon travel plans for tourists and enhance tourists' awareness of environmental protection. Besides, the low-carbon smart tourism supply chain empowered by big data could also have greater market potential. Thus, this marketing technology can subvert the traditional tourism business model and provide a more low-carbon, sustainable, and smart development path for the future of the tourism supply chain. Moreover, TS can continuously improve the level of low-carbon service because of the inspiration of consumers' reference low-carbon service effect, contributing to forming a virtuous cycle and stimulating the low-carbon, efficient, and sustainable development of the tourism supply chain. Furthermore, the cooperation among tourism supply chain members can be deepened by the altruistic preference between TS and OTA, resulting in not only enhancing the low-carbon goodwill and environmental benefits but also bringing a better experience for tourists. The findings indicate that the altruistic preference can simultaneously promote the sustainable development of low-carbon tourism supply chain and achieve supply chain coordination. At the end of the article, we also give the ideal operating status of the low-carbon smart O2O tourism supply chain empowered by big data.}

In addition, from the perspective of asymmetric information sharing regarding agricultural products, an asymmetric information sharing model for agricultural products based on the evolutionary rule theory is established. Combined with fuzzy big data and LSGDM, this paper puts forward the hypothesis of each variable in the process of the information sharing game. On this basis, a mathematical model of the "pool equilibrium" of the high and low prices in the agricultural products market is put forward. Finally, a case study of products of different quality in the sea cucumber market is carried out. The results show that high quality sea cucumber products occupy a large market share in the supply chain of agricultural products. The research of this paper is of great significance, because it can increase the reliable theoretical data available for the research of the agricultural supply chain.}

abstract = {Eco-innovations (EI) are activities that are strongly focused on innovation in products, processes, and organizational philosophies to improve environmental performance. Because eco-innovation is a multi-faceted concept comprising of inputs, outputs, operations, the efficiency of resources, and socioeconomic outcomes, big data analytics helps to better understand its dynamics. In this paper, dynamic data envelopment analysis (Dynamic DEA) is employed to analyze the eco-innovation efficiency over time. This paper proposes a novel technique based on goal programming to find a common set of weights (CSW) in relational dynamic DEA. To validate the applicability of the proposed method, eco-innovation of 27 members of the European Union (EU-27) is evaluated during the period 2011–2013 at the national level. Findings show that the discrimination power of the proposed method is higher than relational dynamic DEA and this approach can provide a full ranking of decision-making units (DMUs). Findings further highlight that Germany and Estonia are the highest and the lowest-ranked countries in terms of eco-innovation, respectively.}

abstract = {According to the national balance sheets of the most advanced economies, despite a recent sharp decline in per capita net wealth, Italian private households present a higher rate among the wealthiest and least indebted in Europe. Recently, the COVID-19 outbreak caused a new leap in households' savings worldwide, particularly in advanced economies and Italy. This study underlines that using advanced analytics tools, household saving behaviour information, and big data analytics may support data-driven decision approaches addressing the management of complex relationships in the financial arena. More specifically, using exploratory and predictive analyses based on big data analytics and machine learning, this study aims to provide extensive customer profiling in the household saving sector in Italy, supporting a data-driven decision-making approach. A profiling of household savings has been defined using the information provided by big data analysis. To proceed in this direction, the hardware and software requirements necessary to perform data processing were considered in the first phase of the study. Data collection was performed according to the so-called extract, transform, load (ETL) process. The contribution of this study lies in the results obtained in terms of data analytics over a dataset that accounts for the purchasing behaviour of almost 20 million postal savers. The clustering algorithm is highly efficient and scales well for large datasets. K-means clustering can be implemented within the MapReduce computational framework. Therefore, the overall procedure proposed here can be easily extended to big data using parallel computing and software implementing MapReduce, such as Hadoop and Spark.}

However, there is a disconnect between the opportunities presented and the readiness of incumbent firms to engage with big data, with consequences for their ability to benefit from it. With many organisations overwhelmed by how to manage and use big data, the paper identifies the dynamic capabilities required to exploit big data for strategic marketing and to improve market responsiveness. Data gathered from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with senior managers from four case study organisations, reveals the five interconnected dynamic capabilities required to leverage value from big data. These capabilities are shown to be part of a sequential ‘sensing-reconfiguring-seizing’ process, in which the reconfiguring capabilities play a vital role. The findings contribute to dynamic capabilities theory by identifying and mapping the configuration of big data capabilities required to support strategic marketing initiatives. A new Big Data Capabilities Model is developed, which can be used by organisations to guide how they can leverage value from big data.}

This article uses Python to crawl a total of 139075 consumer review data from 164 green products on the JingDong (JD.com) e-commerce platform from June 1, 2020 to May 6, 2023, identifies consumers’ key focus on green products in the four fields of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. And it explores the mechanism of joint action between each content, analyzes consumers’ green consumption sentiment and their causes, and deeply studies the dimensions of consumer demand by using TF-IDF segmentation weight analysis, word cloud mapping, network semantic analysis, sentiment analysis, and theme word mining. The research has found that: (1) The green consumption sentiment of consumers has an increasingly positive time trend. (2) Consumers prioritize appearance for clothing and home products, quality for food products, and service for travel products. And customer service attitude is an important factor that leads to the transformation of positive sentiment to negative sentiment. (3) The basic attributes that consumers pay attention to green products are mainly quality, appearance, transportation, price, service, and brand. Consumers’ attention to the green features and basic attributes of green products shows a significant growth trend. And consumers’ attention to the green features of green products can enhance their recommendation and loyalty. (4) The combined effect of consumers’ core and sub-core concerns forms consumers’ evaluation of green products. The participles in the core circle are the positive core determining factors for consumers’ green consumption sentiment, while the participles in the secondary core circle are the driving factors that make green consumption sentiment approach the maximum value. (5) Consumers’ demand for green products is mainly reflected in three dimensions: aesthetic acceptance demand, leisure and entertainment demand, and physiological and safety demand. The findings of this paper can provide a reference for the planning of green transition, upgrading of enterprises and the improvement of the production, design and sales process of green products, and provide a reference for the formulation and implementation of government policies to promote green consumption.}

We consider the difference between big data service impacting both channels and impacting only one (traditional retail channel or online direct marketing channel). The results show that whether the manufacturer or the retailer invests in big data service, the impact of big data service on two channels at the same time is more attractive to the manufacturer and the retailer than just one channel. There are three models of investing in big data services that only affect a single channel, resulting in unreasonable pricing decisions and big data service level. In the other three models, when the fixed cost of big data service investment is large, the manufacturer and the retailer are reluctant to invest in big data service. When the investment cost is small, both parties are willing to invest in big data service. This will lead to the manufacturer and retailer making different choices, and the manufacturer as the leader will adopt the cost-sharing strategy to motivate the retailer to agree to choose the same model with the manufacturer. However, when the investment cost of big data services is moderate, the manufacturer and the retailer will choose the manufacturer to invest in big data service. Moreover, the manufacturer and the retailer will not choose the model where the manufacturer invests in big data service only affect the online direct marketing channel, because this model cannot maximize profit of them. Finally, according to the conclusion, management suggestions and enlightenment are obtained.}

abstract = {In a big data model (or database as interchangeably called), the data analysis can be eased out by extracting a smaller set of the data of interest, called subset, from the mammoth original dataset. Thus, a subset helps enhance the performance of a system by avoiding the unwanted iterations through the huge parent data in further analysis. In this study, the data model of interest is the Parametric Big Data Model (ParaDB), which is well-known for handling multidimensional big data. Unlike the other classical data models, where subset provides additional strength to the system and the ParaDB completely lacks this potential functionality and consequently could not become equally efficient and effective comparatively. Therefore, in this research, we implement the subset capability in ParaDB to further strengthen its robustness and to ensure the relational outcome instead of streamed-out plain text. Furthermore, to perform the preliminary investigation, the exploratory visual analysis is an important aspect in any, especially spatio-temporal, big data model. Unfortunately, the ParaDB does not offer any visualization support earlier in any format. Therefore, some comprehensive steps are taken to implement the visualization functionality in ParaDB in a way that is conducive to its structures. Additionally, the GIS-visual richness is integrated and implemented to further strengthen the visual maturity of ParaDB, where it offers the queryable-visualization.}

The main contribution of the study is to propose a framework by making ideal matching and ranking of big data solutions to barriers to circularity in dairy supply chains. This framework further offers a specific roadmap as a practical contribution while investigating companies with restricted resources. In this study the main barriers are classified as ‘economic’, ‘environmental’, ‘social and legal’, ‘technological’, ‘supply chain management’ and ‘strategic’ with twenty-seven sub-barriers. Various big data solutions such as machine learning, optimization, data mining, cloud computing, artificial neural network, statistical techniques and social network analysis have been suggested. Big data solutions are matched with circularity focused barriers to show which solutions succeed in overcoming barriers. A hybrid decision framework based on the fuzzy ANP and the fuzzy VIKOR is developed to find the weights of the barriers and to rank the big data driven solutions. The results indicate that among the main barriers, ‘economic’ was of the highest importance, followed by ‘technological’, ‘environmental’, ‘strategic’, ‘supply chain management’ then ‘social and legal barrier’ in dairy supply chains. In order to overcome circularity focused barriers, ‘optimization’ is determined to be the most important big data solution. The other solutions to overcoming proposed challenges are ‘data mining’, ‘machine learning’, ‘statistical techniques’ and ‘artificial neural network’ respectively. The suggested big data solutions will be useful for policy makers and managers to deal with potential barriers in implementing circularity in the context of dairy supply chains.}

To address this question, this study draws on the resource-based view, dynamic capabilities view, and on recent literature on big data analytics, and examines the indirect relationship between a firm’s big data analytics capability (BDAC) and competitive performance. The study extends existing research by proposing that BDACs enable firms to generate insight that can help strengthen their dynamic capabilities, which, in turn, positively impact marketing and technological capabilities. To test our proposed research model, we used survey data from 202 chief information officers and IT managers working in Norwegian firms. By means of partial least squares structural equation modeling, results show that a strong BDAC can help firms build a competitive advantage. This effect is not direct but fully mediated by dynamic capabilities, which exerts a positive and significant effect on two types of operational capabilities: marketing and technological capabilities. The findings suggest that IS researchers should look beyond direct effects of big data investments and shift their attention on how a BDAC can be leveraged to enable and support organizational capabilities.}

The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data in terms of how businesses manage their digital transformation. The paper argues that the outbreak of IoT and Big Data has resulted in a mass of disorganized knowledge. In order to make sense of the noise, a literature review was carried out to examine the studies, published in the last decade (2008–2019), that analyzed both the Internet of Things and Big Data. The results show that IoT and Big Data are predominantly reengineering factors for business processes, products and services; however, a lack of widespread knowledge and adoption has led research to evolve into multiple, yet inconsistent paths. The study offers interesting implications for managers and marketers, highlighting how the digital transformation enabled by IoT and Big Data can positively impact many facets of business. By treating IoT and Big Data as faces of the same coin, this study also sheds light on current challenges and opportunities, with the hope of informing future research and practice.}

abstract = {This study demonstrates that web-search traffic information, in particular, Google Trends data, is a credible novel source of high-quality and easy-to-access data for analyzing technology-based new ventures (TBNVs) growth trajectories. Utilizing the diverse sample of 241 US-based TBNVs, we comparatively analyze the relationship between companies’ evolution curves represented by search activity on the one hand and by valuations achieved through rounds of venture investments on another. The results suggest that TBNV's growth dynamics are positively and strongly correlated with its web search traffic across the sample. This correlation is more robust when a company is a) more successful (in terms of valuation achieved) – especially if it is a “unicorn”; b) consumer-oriented (i.e., b2c); and 3) develops products in the form of a digital platform. Further analysis based on fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) shows that for the most successful companies (“unicorns”) and consumer-oriented digital platforms (i.e., b2c digital platform companies) proposed approach may be extremely reliable, while for other high-growth TBNVs it is useful for analyzing their growth dynamics, albeit to a more limited degree. The proposed methodological approach opens a wide range of possibilities for analyzing, researching and predicting the growth of recently formed growth-oriented companies, in practice and academia.}

They are also general in scope and not specific for manufacturing scenarios. This study provides an innovative maturity model, also including an assessment tool and an evaluation method. This model has been designed according to a well-founded methodology that is based on a structured procedure to assess maturity, as follows: organisation, data management, data analytics, infrastructure, governance & security. To enhance its validity, the model has been applied in three industrial companies working in the aerospace, automotive and machinery sectors. The results demonstrate the model's ability to leverage big data management and analytics through a deep, easy, and context-independent assessment that is focused on industrial scenarios. The suggested model enriches the state of art on big data and analytics maturity models providing a methodology and tool to apply on specific industrial case. Academics can benefit from the results to design and guide future research in this field.}

Literature shows that data analytics can improve the performance of SMEs. However, SMEs face many barriers in adopting this technological innovation. Unfortunately, the literature on data analytics adoption in SMEs is limited. Our goal is to identify the drivers and barriers to data analytics adoption in SMEs. With 35 semi-structured interviews with SMEs in the manufacturing and agricultural industries from France, we establish two comprehensive typologies of drivers and barriers. Our results show that exogenous drivers such as market, competition and the Covid-19 crisis have a stronger influence on data analytics adoption in SMEs than endogenous drivers. Endogenous barriers like lack of strategy, skills and organizational culture have a more negative influence on data analytics adoption in SMEs than exogenous barriers. This article contributes to better understanding of data analytics adoption process in SMEs. Our research helps SMEs manage organizational transformation and develop a strategy supporting technology adoption.}

To enhance their sustainability, operational efficiency, and competitiveness, maritime organizations are therefore very keen to build big data analytics capability (BDAC). However, various barriers, mean that only a handful are able to do so. We adopt a mixed-method approach to analyze these barriers. Thematic analysis is used to identify five categories of barriers and 16 individual barriers based on empirical data collected from 26 maritime organizations. These are then prioritized using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), followed by total interpretive structural modelling (TISM) to understand their interrelationships. Finally, cross-impact matrix multiplications applied to classification (MICMAC) is employed to differentiate the role of each barrier based on its driving and dependence power. This paper makes several theoretical contributions. First, China's hierarchical cultural value orientation encourages competition and obedience to rules, resulting in unwillingness to share knowledge, lack of coordination, and lack of error correction mechanisms. These cultural barriers hinder BDAC development. Second, organizational learning category barriers are found to be the most important in impeding BDAC development. This study also raises practitioners' awareness of the need to tackle cultural and organizational learning barriers.}

Taking social media analytics as an example, this paper is among the first attempts to theoretically explain and empirically test the market performance impact of big data analytics. Drawing on the systems theory, we explain how and why social media analytics create super-additive value through the synergies in functional complementarity between social media diversity for gathering big data from diverse social media channels and big data analytics for analyzing the gathered big data. Furthermore, we deepen our theorizing by considering the difference between small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and large firms in the required integration effort that enables the synergies of social media diversity and big data analytics. In line with this theorizing, we empirically test the synergistic effect of social media diversity and big data analytics by using a recent large-scale survey data set from 18,816 firms in Italy. We find that social media diversity and big data analytics have a positive interaction effect on market performance, which is more salient for SMEs than for large firms.}

Based on Chinese city data from to 2009–2019, this study’s estimates show that urban carbon emissions (CE) decreased by 11.8% after the implementation of the NBDCPZ policy. To ensure the robustness of our results, various tests were conducted, all of which confirmed the negative causal effect of NBDCPZ on CE. Heterogeneity studies have shown that cities with higher initial carbon endowments have greater reductions in carbon emissions owing to the introduction of NBDCPZ policies. In addition, the impact of the policy on urban energy conservation and emission reduction in eastern China is particularly significant. The mechanism analysis shows that NBDCPZ policy achieves emission reduction through activating the CE reduction effect of green technology and encouraging low-carbon virtual life.}

abstract = {The emergence of digitally connected products and big data analytics (BDA) in industrial marketing has attracted academic and managerial interest in smart services. However, suppliers' provision of smart services and customers' adoption of these services have received scarce attention in the literature, demonstrating the need to address the changing nature of customer-supplier interactions in the digital era. Responding to prior research calls, this study utilizes ethnographic research and a storytelling lens to advance our knowledge of how stories and BDA can enhance customers' attitudes toward suppliers' smart services, their behavioral intentions and their actual adoption of smart services. The study's findings demonstrate that storytelling is a collective sensemaking and sensegiving process that occurs in interactions between customers and suppliers in which both parties contribute to the story development. The use of BDA in storytelling enhances customer sensemaking of smart services by highlighting the business value extracted from the digitized data of a reference customer. By synthesizing insights from servitization, storytelling, BDA and the customer reference literature, this study offers managers practical guidance regarding how to increase smart service sales. An example of a story used to facilitate customer adoption of a supplier's smart services in the manufacturing sector is provided.}

In particular, applying the dual perspective of customer engagement, this research examines the influence of focusing on the entertainment, interaction, trendiness, and customization dimensions of a luxury brand's social media activities on customer engagement with brand-related social media content. Using big data retrieved from a 60-month period on Twitter (July 2012 to June 2017), this paper analyzes 3.78 million tweets from the top 15 luxury brands with the highest number of Twitter followers. The results indicate that focusing on the entertainment, interaction, and trendiness dimensions of a luxury brand's social media marketing efforts significantly increases customer engagement, while focusing on the customization dimension does not. The findings have important implications for the design, delivery, and management of social media marketing for luxury brands to engage customers with social media content.}

The characteristics of an ideal data environment for Big Data adoption and development to take place are identified. The key findings reveal that while there was general awareness of the importance of Big Data, it was evident that the adoption and development of Big Data decision support was heavily reliant on a data environment that promotes transparency and a clear corporate data strategy.}

Firms are thus looking for newer ways to attract, satisfy and retain those customers as their needs and aspirations change. Such newer ways constitute the firms’ quest to achieve competitive advantage. However, in this current digital era almost all the traditional “Porterian” competitive advantage barriers are difficult to sustain. Further, COVID has led to a rapid acceleration in the pace of digitalisation. Can the huge data generated in every digitally enabled entity of today be judiciously combined with other firm resources? Can this big data be transformed into meaningful knowledge which organisations can leverage to sustain and grow? Can big data provide a sustainable competitive advantage? In this conceptual paper, I use a knowledge-based approach analysed through resource-based view from the strategic management domain to search for answers to these questions. I introduce a holistic framework that integrates the following: (i) firm knowledge, (ii) managerial capabilities and decision-making, (iii) sustainable competitive advantage, (iv) big data analytics. I call this framework the “The Perpetual Model of BDA as a Sustainable Competitive Advantage”. I also propose a unique Analytic Maturity Model, which I call the SAMDDC-DAMPPC Model, which can help identify and classify firms based on their analytic maturity.}

Most research on Big Data and productivity (or performance) tends to focus on internal factors that prevent retailers from fully exploiting their investment in BDA. Research has paid scarce attention to the benefits that can accrue to the focal firm from the upstream investment in BDA and the features of the B2B marketing environment that may hamper (or enhance) these benefits. Unlike the previous literature, the paper tests the extent to which retailers, by having access to larger share of graduate workforce at regionally, can benefit more from inter-industry upstream investment in BDA than retailers located in areas where such workforce is scarce. Using data from ORBIS, KLEMS and QLFS, we show that retailers located in regions with a larger proportion of graduate workforce benefit more from inter-industry upstream investment in BDA as they tend to be more efficient on average. Equally, upstream investment in BDA is positively associated to frontier shifts over time (i.e. technical progress).}

The potential to extract actionable insights from Big Data has gained increasing attention of both academics and practitioners operating in several industries.

Therefore, the gap existing between the potential of value creation embedded in the Big Data paradigm and the current limited exploitation of this value represents an area of investigation that this paper aims to explore. In particular, by following a systematic literature review, this study aims at presenting a framework that outlines the multiple value directions that the Big Data paradigm can generate for the adopting organizations. Eleven distinct value directions have been identified and then grouped in five dimensions (Informational, Transactional, Transformational, Strategic, Infrastructural Value), which constitute the pillars of the proposed framework. Finally, the framework has been also preliminarily applied in three case studies conducted within three Italian based companies operating in different industries (e-commerce, fast-moving consumer goods, and banking) in the final aim to see its applicability in real business scenarios.}

We analysed 621 k emails exchanged between 2009 and 2018. We identified a number of discussion clusters that were considered proxies for the interest buyers expressed in the products/services on offer. These clusters and associated discussion trends were linked to the company's revenues and financial performance, showing good predictive power. In doing this, we have demonstrated how widely available data, such as emails, which all companies have, can be used to underpin new methods for the early identification and monitoring of product demand trends, informing marketing strategies.}

In the first period, the firm designs a product to sell to the market and determines whether to apply big data to attract more consumers. In the second period, the firm designs a new product and determines whether to sell the old product and the new product simultaneously, where big data can also be applied in this period to stimulate more demands. We formulate this problem into four models considering whether the firm adopts big data in the first period and/or the second period, and whether the firm only sells the new product or sells both the old and new products in the second period. We find that the firm prefers to apply big data over both periods when the cost is low, only over the second period when the cost is median and will not apply big data when the cost is high. Interestingly, only applying big data over the first period also may bring the most profits with heterogeneous big data coefficients. Furthermore, applying big data in the second period is the better choice for the social welfare.}

This study advances existing knowledge on the BDAC–performance relationship by drawing on the knowledge-based view and contingency theory to argue that how and when BDAC influences market performance is dependent on the intervening role of disruptive business models and the contingency role of competitive intensity. We empirically test this argument on primary data from 360 firms in the United Kingdom. The results show that disruptive business models partially mediate the positive effect of BDAC on market performance, and this indirect positive effect is strengthened when competitive intensity increases. These findings provide new perspectives on the business model processes and competitive conditions under which firms maximize marketplace value from investments in BDACs.}

However, extant literature on BDA capability has paid limited attention to understanding the enabling role of data-driven insights for supporting decision-making and, consequently, enhancing CE performance. We argue that firms drive decision-making quality through data-driven insights, business intelligence and analytics (BI&A), and BDA capability. In this study, we empirically investigated the association of BDA capability with CE performance and examined the mediating role of data-driven insights in the relationship between BDA capability and decision-making. Data were collected from 109 Czech manufacturing firms, and partial least squares structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the data. The results reveal that BDA capability and BI&A are positively associated with decision-making quality. This effect is stronger when the manufacturer utilizes data-driven insights. The results demonstrate that BDA capability drives decision-making quality in organizations, and data-driven insights do not mediate this relationship. BI&A is associated with decision-making quality through data-driven insights. These findings offer important insights to managers, as they can act as a reference point for developing data-driven insights with the CE paradigm in organizations.}

The present study utilised a quantitative-methods approach to investigate factors affecting retailers' adoption of BDA across three countries. A survey questionnaire was used to collect data from managers and decision-makers in the retail industry. Data of 2278 respondents were analysed through structural equation modelling. The findings revealed that security concerns, external support, top management support, and rational decision making culture have a greater effect on BDA adoption in developed countries UK than in UAE and Egypt. However, competition intensity and firm size have a greater effect on BDA adoption in UAE and Egypt than in UK. Finally, human variables (competence of information system's staff and staff's information system knowledge) have a greater effect on BDA adoption in Egypt than UK and UAE. The findings indicate that a “one-size-fits-all” approach is insufficient in capturing the heterogeneity of managers across countries. Implications for practice and theory were demonstrated.}

In this work, we will look at sales data and at large warehouses, which envelop all the said three characteristics of Big Data (BD). This is quite important as demand market data is increasingly shared with supply chain managers. Here, a working architecture is introduced to handle the challenges of BD. The work uses a neural network to detect patterns within the demand. The work combines deep learning with nonlinear programming to enable flexibility at supply chain production facilities to respond to the forecasted demand. The parameters in the neural network are analyzed and studied for each different product type. We see significant prediction improvements when the parameters are better tuned. Further, the work introduces a BD architecture that automates the acquisition of the data, data mining, and the storage of input and output files. Overall, the work utilizes a gradient search method, a genetic algorithm, ARIMA, a deep learning algorithm, and a mixed-integer nonlinear program.}

The availability of timely information about future customer needs is a key success factor for any business. For profit maximization, manufacturers want to sense demand signals and shape future demands using price, sales, promotion and others economic factors so that they can fulfil customer's orders immediately. However, most demand forecasting systems offer limited insight to manufacturers as they fail to capture contemporary market trends, product seasonality and the impact of forecasting on the magnitude of the bullwhip effect. This paper aims to improve the accuracy of demand forecasts. In order to achieve this, a back-propagation neural network-based model is trained by fuzzy inputs and compared with benchmark forecasting methods on a time series data, by using historical demand and sales data in combination with advertising effectiveness, expenditure, promotions, and marketing events data. A statistical analysis is conducted, and the experiments show that the method used in the proposed framework outperforms in optimality, efficiency and other statistical metrics. Finally, some invaluable insights for managers are presented to improve the forecast accuracy of fuzzy neural networks, develop marketing plans for products and discuss their implications in several fields.}

Nevertheless, while researchers and practitioners started to examine the shifts that these technologies entail and their overall business value, it is still unclear whether and under what conditions they drive innovation. To address this gap, this study draws on the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm and information governance theory to explore the interplay between a firm’s big data analytics capabilities (BDACs) and their information governance practices in shaping innovation capabilities. We argue that a firm’s BDAC helps enhance two distinct types of innovative capabilities, incremental and radical capabilities, and that information governance positively moderates this relationship. To examine our research model, we analyzed survey data collected from 175 IT and business managers. Results from partial least squares structural equation modelling analysis reveal that BDACs have a positive and significant effect on both incremental and radical innovative capabilities. Our analysis also highlights the important role of information governance, as it positively moderates the relationship between BDAC’s and a firm’s radical innovative capability, while there is a nonsignificant moderating effect for incremental innovation capabilities. Finally, we examine the effect of environmental uncertainty conditions in our model and find that information governance and BDACs have amplified effects under conditions of high environmental dynamism.}

We propose a framework to automatically analyse these reviews, transforming negative and positive user opinions in a quantitative score. Sentiment analysis was employed to analyse online reviews on Amazon. The Fake Review Detection Framework—FRDF— detects and removes fake reviews using Natural Language Processing technology. The FRDF was tested on reviews of products from high-tech industries. Brands were rated according to consumer sentiment. The findings demonstrate that brand managers and consumers would find this tool useful, in combination with the 5-Star score, for more comprehensive decision-making. For instance, the FRDF ranks the best products by price alongside their respective sentiment value and the 5-Star score.}

This qualitative research is exploratory in nature and fills this gap through findings arising from interviews of managers and by developing taxonomies that highlight the capability of participatory web over passive web to enable different firms to engage in business operations. For this purpose, two important interrelated functions of business i.e. operations and marketing have been mapped against three dimensions of sustainability. Consequently, this research demonstrates the ability of big data and social media analytics within a participatory web environment to enable B2B organisations to become profitable and remain sustainable through strategic operations and marketing related business activities. The research findings will be useful for both academics and managers who are interested in understanding and further developing the business use of participatory web tools to achieve business sustainability. Hence, this may be considered as a distinct way of attaining sustainability.}

This paper reviews the developments and use of Deep Learning(DL), RL, and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)methods in information-based decision-making in financial industries. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the variety of learning methods, related terminology, and their applicability in the financial field. First, we introduce Markov decision processes, followed by Various algorithms focusing on value and policy-based methods that do not require any model assumptions. Next, connections are made with neural networks to extend the framework to encompass deep RL algorithms. Finally, the paper concludes by discussing the application of these RL and DRL algorithms in various decision-making problems in finance, including optimal execution, portfolio optimization, option pricing, hedging, and market-making. The survey results indicate that RL and DRL can provide better performance and higher efficiency than traditional algorithms while facing real economic problems in risk parameters and ever-increasing uncertainties.

Extant literature has prescribed many treatments on how SMEs could survive in post COVID-19 situation, but studies did not analyse how big data driven innovation could improve supply chain management (SCM) process in the post COVID-19 pandemic under the moderating influence of SME technology leadership support. Thus, there is a research gap in this important domain. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of big data driven innovation and technology capability of the SME on its supply chain system. The study also investigates the moderating role of SME technology leadership support on SME performance in the post COVID-19 scenario. With the help of literature and resource-based view (RBV) and dynamic capability view (DCV) theory, a theoretical model has been developed conceptually. Later the model is validated using structural equation modelling (SEM) technique with 327 usable respondents from SMEs from India. The study found that both big data driven innovation and the techno-functional capability of SME impacts supply chain capability which in turn impacts the SME performance in the post COVID-19 scenario. The study also finds that there will be a moderating impact of SME technology leadership support on SME performance.}

Population-wide, “macroscopic” parameters are needed when privacy, ethics or regulatory constraints block “big data” techniques (e.g., in political contexts to counter “micro-targeting”). Confidence will be eroded if existing trend models and other macroscopic approaches frequently fail to predict outcomes, however campaign data reveal mathematical features that suggest a different possible approach. Given that the populations modelled exhibit self-organisation and memory when transmitting viewpoints, our model is based on mathematical representations of such processes. Its validation indicates the applicability and potential generalisability of this theoretical approach. In order to design a stochastic dynamics model of changing voter preferences, we evaluated probability models for transitions between possible system states (magnitudes of voter preferences), formulated the boundary task for probability density functions and derived a second-order non-linear differential equation incorporating self-organisation and memory. We find consistent dependencies between influences on the system and its reaction, and it is congruent with empirical data. The ability to use researchable global parameters indicates the potential for modelling electoral processes and wider applicability for complex social processes, avoiding dependence on “internal” variables.}

In the first stage of the study, customers’ satisfaction big data have been extracted with the assistance of a web scrapping tool from TripAdvisor for 189 hotels in Hubei province, and behavioral data from Hubei province hospitality websites have been gathered with the assistance of web analytics platforms for 5.7 million website visitors for the last 18 months. In the second stage of the research, those data have been statistically analyzed including descriptive, correlation, and regression analysis. Then, a fuzzy cognitive map has been created to present the intercorrelation between the parameters and two optimization scenarios have been developed for digital brand name and customer satisfaction. Finally, an Agent-based model has been created in order to simulate the customers’ behavior in the corporate website and TripAdvisor. The results indicated that hotels in Hubei province need to invest less in social media advertisements than search engine advertisements in order to achieve a competitive advantage and improve their digital brand name. Additionally, hotels need to develop their websites with more engaging content to maintain the customer on the corporate website for more time in order to optimize customer satisfaction in contrast to healthcare and libraries websites.}

We propose a research model theoretically grounded on organizational information processing theory (OIPT) to investigate the roles of big data analytics capability (BDAC) in developing hospital supply chain integration (SCI) and operational flexibility. The results from our analysis of survey data from a sample of 105 senior executives from the Chinese hospitals reveal that BDAC has a significant impact on three dimensions of hospital SCI: inter-functional integration, hospital-patient integration, and hospital-supplier integration; and that hospital-patient integration and hospital-supplier integration fully mediate the relationship between inter-functional integration and operational flexibility. These findings extend and validate OIPT within the context of big data-driven hospital supply chains, while also providing useful and timely guidance to healthcare practitioners in developing data-driven SCI for better operational flexibility, especially to respond to the unprecedented disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.}

The study finds that the use of customer big data significantly fosters sales growth (i.e. monetary performance outcomes) and enhances the customer relationship performance (non-monetary performance outcomes). However, the latter effect is stronger for firms which have an analytics culture which supports marketing analytics, whereas the former effect remains unchanged regardless of the analytics culture. The study empirically confirms that customer big data analytics improves customer relationship performance and sales growth in B2B firms.}

Drawing on the resource-based view, this study argues that a firm's data-driven culture and the competitive pressure it faces in the industry motivate a firm's assimilation of BDAI. As a firm resource, BDAI enables an organization to develop superior mass-customization capability, which in turn positively influences its CRM performance. In addition, this study proposes that a firm's marketing capability can moderate the impact of BDAI assimilation on its mass-customization capability. Using survey data collected from 147 business-to-business companies, this study finds support for most of the hypotheses. The findings of this study uncover compelling insights about the dynamics involved in the process of using BDAI to improve CRM performance.}

The four value creation mechanisms investigated (the source of the value being pursued) are transparency, access, discovery, and proactive adaptation, while the four value targets (the impacts of the value creation process) are organization performance, business process improvement, customer experience and market enhancement, and product and service innovation. The proposed empirical validation of Grover et al.’s (2018) model adopts an econometric analysis applied to data gathered through a survey involving 256 BDA experts. The results reveal that transparency mediates the relationship for all the value targets, while access and proactive adaptation mediate only in case of some value targets, and discovery does not have any mediating effect. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed at the end of the paper.}

This study explores the impact of technological innovation, Big Data marketing and overconfidence on supply chain member decision-making. We propose a two-stage remanufacturing CLSC dynamic model consisting of a manufacturer, an IRP, and a supplier based on differential game theory. By comparing the optimal decisions of each member in three scenarios, we find that the IRP’s overconfident behavior is beneficial to both the manufacturer and the IRP but will damage the supplier's profit. Although a suitable cost-sharing ratio can enable the manufacturer and IRP to achieve a “win–win” situation, an excessive level of confidence will inhibit the incentives of the cost-sharing strategy, negatively affecting the manufacturer's interests. Interestingly, a cost-sharing contract will become inefficient under certain conditions, i.e., highly efficient level of technological innovation, highly efficient Big Data marketing, and a high level of overconfidence, negatively affecting the manufacturer’s interests. Additionally, technological innovation efficiency and marketing efficiency will have different effects on the IRP's recycling price. A cost-sharing contract and the IRP’s overconfidence will prompt the IRP to exert more efforts on technological innovation and Big Data marketing and to significantly reduce the manufacturing costs and recycling costs for all members. Notably, although the IRP’s overconfidence and cost-sharing strategies may damage the supplier’s profit, the total profit of the CLSC increases.}

Statistics show that over 4.41 billion people will subscribe to social media by 2025, which covers the majority of the world’s population. Its versatility and enriched features allow users to upload and download large data (e.g, High Definition (HD)) videos and HD live streaming). This heavy workload overburdens the mainstream network and social media cloud, increasing the delay and costs for instant communications. To cope with the aforementioned challenges, this paper aims to minimize the social big data effects on the mainstream network and the social media cloud servers. In connection with these objectives, a survey result shows that 75% of social connections originate from the local region, and their data has no need for instant migration to the remote cloud servers. We extended the Edge/Fog computing concept to create Regional Computing (RC) for Social Media Platforms (SMP). These servers are created at the regional level. Initially, the data is stored and processed at regional computing servers and later on, in off-peak hours, migrated to the cloud servers. The initial result shows that the regional computing servers filter the content regionally and minimize the burden on the mainstream network. It also reduces the cloud server’s workload, resulting in minimal delays and costs.}

The required sensing and communication technologies have already matured and became affordable for most organizations. Businesses on the other hand require more operational data to address the dynamic and stochastic nature of supply chains. So why should we wait for the actual implementation of tracking and monitoring devices within the supply chain itself? This paper provides an objective overview of state-of-the-art IoT developments in today’s supply chain and logistics research. The main aim is to find examples of academic literature that explain how organizations can incorporate real-time data of physically operating objects into their decision making. A systematic literature review is conducted to gain insight into the IoT’s analytical capabilities, resulting into a list of 79 cross-disciplinary publications. Most researchers integrate the newly developed measuring devices with more traditional ICT infrastructures to either visualize the current way of operating, or to better predict the system’s future state. The resulting health/condition monitoring systems seem to benefit production environments in terms of dependability and quality, while logistics operations are becoming more flexible and faster due to the stronger emphasis on prescriptive analytics (e.g., association and clustering). Further research should extend the IoT’s perception layer with more context-aware devices to promote autonomous decision making, invest in wireless communication networks to stimulate distributed data processing, bridge the gap in between predictive and prescriptive analytics by enriching the spectrum of pattern recognition models used, and validate the benefits of the monitoring systems developed.}

This paper delves into the main empirical approaches of constructing GT indicators, conducts a thorough methodological review, and elucidates the nuances and potentials of GT data. Specifically, the paper furnishes a step-by-step methodological guide for constructing GT indicators: from data pre-treatment to composite estimation using an array of machine learning techniques (principal component analysis, XGBoost, and dynamic factor models). We scrutinize the prevalent construction strategies of GT indicators, compare the use of keyword-based vs. category-based estimations, single indicators vs. composite indicators, and evaluate the significance of various data transformations. Illustrating the utility of our methodological framework through a case study, we create GT indicators for US retail trade and examine their forecasting accuracy in comparison to a benchmark autoregressive model. Our findings reveal that XGBoost yields the optimal test sample fit among composite indicators, while category-specific indicators like Shopping and Retail Trade exhibit worse predictive accuracy. As an additional contribution, we provide a detailed and user-friendly R code for replicating our analysis.}

We show that SA of tweets has potential as a real-time barometer of public sentiment towards negotiating outcomes to inform government decision-making. Despite the increasing need for information on collective preferences regarding possible negotiating outcomes, negotiators have been slow to capitalise on BDA. Through SA on a corpus of 13,018,367 tweets on defined Brexit hashtags, we illustrate how SA can provide a platform for decision-makers engaged in international negotiations to grasp collective preferences. We show that BDA and SA can enhance decision-making and strategy in public policy and negotiation contexts of the magnitude of Brexit. Our findings indicate that the preferred or least preferred Brexit outcomes could have been inferred by the emotions expressed by Twitter users. We argue that BDA can be a mechanism to map the different options available to decision-makers and bring insights to and inform their decision-making. Our work, thereby, proposes SA as part of the international negotiation toolbox to remedy for the existing informational gap between decision makers and citizens’ preferred outcomes.}

Based on a dataset of 278 Chinese cities during 2011–2019, this article explores the non-linear effects of local environmental constraints on city's position in DVC, and then captures the role of digital technology in this process. Results confirm an inverted U-shaped effect of direct environmental constraint on DVC, while indirect environmental constraint shows positive U-shaped curve and needs more than 0.2864 to generate promotion effect. Besides, carbon control policies significantly increase the promotion effect of indirect environmental constraint on DVC. Digital technology in interval [8.6972, 9.8902] can most effectively amplify the policy effectiveness of local environmental constraints, which makes a gentler inverted U-shaped curve of direct environmental constraint, and reverses the indirect environmental constraint to an inverted U-shaped effect. This article provides new perspectives for a balanced development between local environmental constraints and DVC in the digital era.}

abstract = {In recent years, advancements in machine learning (ML) have facilitated the utilisation of big data across various academic disciplines. Nonetheless, these techniques still require a high-level of programming and data science expertise, making them inaccessible to many researchers and hindering the potential for knowledge advancements. This paper presents a framework for identifying the adoption of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies among European firms that have undergone restructuring events. Existing studies on I4.0 adoption rely on diverse data sources at different levels of aggregation (e.g., countries, sectors, firms), spanning various time periods and technological domains. While this diversity often complicates result comparison, it also drives researchers and institutions to explore new data sources to assess technology adoption. Our identification methodology is based on the implementation of ML techniques using STATA, a well-established and user-friendly statistical software. We offer a step-by-step guide based on recently developed commands, allowing for comparison of model performance and analysis of model features. Our findings underscore the potential of ML algorithms as a robust tool for collecting new firm-level data on I4.0 adoption. Specifically, we observe that business restructuring events predicted as I4.0-related conform to adoption patterns identified in prior studies, across countries, sectors and over time.}

Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to explore this process by theoretically building on the social actor perspective of the firm and investigating the impact of AI-enabled B2B marketing initiatives on shareholder reaction measured by abnormal stock returns. By adopting a propensity score matching (PSM) method to generate an artificial control group of firms without adopting AI-enabled B2B marketing initiatives, we conduct an event study based on 174 sample firms (87 treatment firms and 87 matched control firms) publicly listed in the US between 2011 and 2020. The test results suggest that firms implementing AI for B2B marketing receive greater stock returns than their industry peers without AI implementation. In addition, the stock return is more remarkable for firms operating in turbulent environments and with less complex customer bases. A qualitative focus group discussion was conducted to further complement and enrich the findings. This study provides the first empirical evidence regarding the shareholder reaction to AI-enabled B2B marketing initiatives. The results reveal the significance of the fit between AI-enabled B2B marketing values and firms' business environments. It encourages future studies to investigate AI implementation from the social actor perspective.}

The structured methodology is demonstrated to improve forecast accuracy in a real case of a F&B company while providing several insights into the challenges and opportunities of integrating advanced information technology into the demand forecasting process. The main challenges include effectively categorising the impact factors of SM on demand forecasting, translating insights from SM into actionable decisions, and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data obtained from SM networks.

However, academic scholarship has expressed concerns over the misalignment of research priorities and their impact on data usage and choice of analytics. On the one hand, an inadequate understanding of healthcare themes and algorithmic nuances has posed difficulty for healthcare professionals to evaluate AI solutions and understand their generalizability and potential biases. On the other hand, the abundance of analytical tools, their complexity, and a misalignment between data type and analysis methods have presented major challenges for analysts in selecting a suitable method. As a result, healthcare research has mostly developed in silos. We propose a techno-functional framework that combines the perspectives of analysts and healthcare professionals, identifies key research themes (i.e., healthcare delivery, patient engagement, data management, market design, and policy and governance), and presents critical research questions that can guide future studies. We also propose a schema for segmenting analysis techniques based on data type and analytical complexity. This schema may help analysts select a suitable analysis technique and data to solve a specific problem. Our study aims to improve the understanding of healthcare analytics among researchers, analysts, and healthcare professionals and present a roadmap for future research.}

However, these ideas may be only hidden in a small part of the massive reviews. This study aims to investigate the potential of using anomaly detection technology to identify unique reviews for more effective innovation generation. Three classical anomaly detection approaches (including both machine and deep learning) were explored, namely, isolation forest, density-based cluster analysis, and autoencoder methods. Using the consumer reviews on Dyson Vacuum cleaner from Xiaohongshu (one of the most popular social media platforms in China), we tested and compared the application of these three approaches in detecting innovation-relevant reviews. The results indicate that the two machine learning approaches, aka., density-based cluster analysis and isolation forest are too sensitive to the length of the reviews. The deep learning method, autoencoder, on the contrary, shows good stability and capability to detect the unique reviews from the whole dataset. Furthermore, the experts’ rating also confirms the effectiveness of autoencoder in identifying innovation-relevant reviews. Future studies and implications are then discussed.}

Little is currently known of the potential role of the emerging digital technologies in furthering the sustainability of supermarket chains in emerging economies. Thus, an original multiple case study has been conducted, involving six supermarket chains operating in Brazil and six farming distributors that produce fruit and vegetables (F&V). The findings show that actions towards food waste reduction based on the principles of the circular economy begin with an understanding of F&V stages of deterioration. Through such an understanding, a number of actions can be undertaken to reduce the negative effects of this deterioration. These include (among others) the management of prices, sales, operations, and purchases, all of which can be underpinned by such technologies as sensors and augmented reality in order to manage dynamic pricing, storage, and item display. The findings contribute to demonstrating how digital technologies can help supermarkets’ marketing departments in driving corporate sustainability while also benefiting both consumers and societal well-being.}

Specifically, we tested a model –from two different perspectives– that would explain information quality through analytical talent and organizations' data plan alignment. Results showed that both managers have a different understanding of what information quality is. The characteristics that make marketing a better informer of information quality are identified.

In the neural network improvement process, the performance of GABP is enhanced through multiple iterations by optimizing the application strategy of advertising scenarios according to the topology of network connections. The study results demonstrate that different algorithms' recognition accuracy and precision show an increasing trend as the number of model iterations increases. The recognition accuracy of GABP increases from 49 % to 72 %, and the recognition precision of the algorithm increases from 69 % to 86 %. In addition, the area under the curve (AUC) value of the GABP network is only 0.6 before the number of neurons increases. When the number of neurons is 400, the AUC value of the algorithm reaches 0.82, and the comprehensive diagnostic value of the system dramatically improves. This research has significant reference value for reforming the traditional advertising work mode, enhancing intellectual development and promoting resource efficiency in the advertising industry.}

With the rapid advancement of digitization (Digi), artificial intelligence, big data, and other associated digital technologies have become powerful driving forces for GC from both the supply and demand perspectives. Therefore, a spatial Durbin model (SDM) was utilized to investigate the local and spatial spillover impacts of Digi on GC based on panel data from 2011 to 2020 from 30 Chinese provinces. It was found that: (1) Digi can influence both the supply and demand aspects of green products, establishing a positive correlation with local GC. It also exerted a favorable incentive effect on GC in neighboring provinces through spatial connections and spatial spillover, within the framework of the imitation mechanism. Several robustness tests revealed that the effects remained significant. (2) the enhanced market mechanisms and a favorable competitive environment offered by the high-level market, in addition to the subsidy and incentive mechanisms within the government's Green Consumption Policy (GCP), were instrumental in fostering the development of GC. Consequently, the government's role in “promotion” and the market's role in “pull” had a regulating effect on the impact of Digi on GC. (3) heterogeneity analysis illustrated that Digi had a more significant promoting effect on GC in the comprehensive big data pilot and large-scale industrial digitization areas. Based on this, we suggest that the state increase investment in Digi to provide a foundation for the research and development of green digital technologies. Additionally, the state should promote the construction and improvement of green consumer markets and formulate more incentive or penalty systems conducive to promoting GC. The research results also provide a theoretical basis for the direct and dynamic effects of Digi, as well as inspiration for promoting GC and green sustainable development.}

However, little research has focused on customers' design requirements at all product life cycle stages, especially with big data. In this study, customers' reviews on mobile phones at various life cycle stages were obtained from the Weibo platform, and the emotional tendencies contained there were analyzed and evaluated. The dictionary of mobile phone life cycle requirements is constructed through machine learning, and customer requirements (CRs) for each mobile phone life cycle stage are mined. Finally, the Kano model is used to identify the essential attributes of mobile phones. The results show that the method proposed in this paper can mine and analyze the requirements of each stage of the product life cycle contained in online reviews and help designers understand the customer needs that must be considered in product design. This study can provide theoretical and methodological support for developing product green design and life cycle assessment.}

According to the dynamic capabilities view and using previous studies, we developed a conceptual framework to explore the effect of marketing analytics use on customer agility and customer satisfaction. In Study 1, we utilised cross-sectional data collected from 468 managers from various industries. In study 2, we employed longitudinal data in a three-wave longitudinal utilising a cross-lagged panel model. Study 1 indicated that data acquisition and tool acquisition are key drivers in adopting marketing analytics. Marketing analytics use has stronger effect on customer agility when market turbulence is high. They also revealed that the influence of customer agility on customer satisfaction in such conditions is stronger. Study 2 revealed that marketing analytics use at time point T1 has a significant and positive influence on customer agility at time point T2, while customer agility at time point T2 has a significant and positive influence on customer satisfaction at time point T3. These findings indicate strong temporal effects between marketing analytics use, customer agility, and customer satisfaction. The findings suggest that researchers should look beyond direct effects of marketing analytics use and shift their attention on how a marketing analytics can be leveraged to enable and support dynamic capabilities and customer satisfaction.}

Then, differential game theory is used to model and derive the objective functions and equilibrium strategies of the FDSSC members in four scenarios: decentralization, independent delivery, independent production, and centralization. The effects of cooperation patterns among the FDSSC members, consumer channel preferences, commission rates, and food delivery fees of the food delivery platform on the optimal decision-making and performance of the FDSSC members are discussed. Through comparative analysis and sensitivity analysis of essential parameters, we summarize the following conclusions. First, whether it is independent production and independent delivery, any cooperation between the FDSSC members is always beneficial for the profit improvement of all FDSSC members. Therefore, the restaurant, food delivery platform, and rider should actively seek pairwise or tripartite cooperation to achieve common profit enhancement. In addition, when the online channel preference of consumers increases, the restaurant should continuously enhance the food quality and catering service level to ensure an amazing dining experience for consumers, which is conducive to the formation of a healthy dual-channel food sales model. Last, a higher commission rate can increase the profits of the food delivery platform and the whole FDSSC, but it damages the revenue of the restaurant, while a higher food delivery fee can bring more profits to the restaurant and rider.}

Taking the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) as a case study, this paper explores how machine learning can harness existing project data to uncover latent information about food systems dynamics, which is already present in documentation but has not yet been investigated. Specifically, we aim to provide evidence on the evolution of food system dimensions within IFAD-funded projects through the application of supervised text mining, network analysis and LASSO regression to project documents collected from hundreds of projects spanning the whole of IFAD's investment portfolio in the 1981-2019 interval. Findings show an increase in reporting against food system dimensions and consolidate the applicability of machine learning analytics to uncover historical trends about international agencies’ activities and accelerate knowledge generation around strategic themes.}

The rapid and ceaseless increase in big data of reviews on e-commerce platforms, social media, or review portals becomes a stimulus for the automation of these processes. In recent years, deep transfer learning has opted to solve many challenging tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) relieving the hassles of exhaustive training and the requirement of extensive labelled datasets. In this work, we propose frameworks for Abstractive Summarization (ABS) and Sentiment Analysis (SA) of airline reviews using Pretrained Language Models (PLM). The abstractive summarization model goes through two finetuning stages, the first one, for domain adaptation and the second one, for final task learning. Several studies in the literature empirically demonstrate that review rating has a positive correlation with sentiment valence. For the sentiment classification framework, we used the rating value as a signal to determine the review sentiment, and the model is built on top of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture. We evaluated our models comprehensively with multiple metrics. Our results indicate competitive performance of the models in terms of most of the evaluation metrics.}

This paper presents heatmapping and bootstrapping cluster analysis (HMBCA), a novel machine-learning based diagnostic workflow, as a new tool to aid in strengthening the process. A substantive example on the overall organizational knowledge acquisition behaviors demonstrates that the bootstrapping cluster simulation approach provided promising results regarding the factor structure as measured by the Approximately Unbiased (AU) p-values under the following conditions: when factor correlations are weaker or moderate, with simulated data containing smaller samples. The study suggests that researchers may leverage bootstrapping cluster simulations to validate constructs through both visual inspection and probability estimates when faced with constraints such as a small sample size.}

The widespread availability of user-generated content (UGC) presents a unique opportunity for firms to gain a nuanced understanding of their customers. However, the size and complexity of UGC datasets pose significant challenges for traditional market research methods, limiting their effectiveness in this context. To address this challenge, this study leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to extract nuanced insights from UGC. By integrating sentiment analysis and topic modeling algorithms, we analyzed a dataset of approximately four million X posts (formerly tweets) encompassing 20 global brands across industries. The findings reveal primary brand-related emotions and identify the top 10 keywords indicative of brand-related sentiment. Using FedEx as a case study, we identify five prominent areas of customer concern: parcel tracking, small business services, the firm's comparative performance, package delivery dynamics, and customer service. Overall, this study offers a roadmap for academics to navigate the complex landscape of generating CI from UGC datasets. It thus raises pertinent practical implications, including boosting customer service, refining marketing strategies, and better understanding customer needs and preferences, thereby contributing to more effective, more responsive business strategies.}

To empirically test these relationships, text mining and natural language processing are used to construct a large dataset of influencers’ affiliate marketing posts from their Instagram feeds. The analysis reveals certain linguistic styles can enhance engagement, while others negatively impact these behaviors.

By leveraging demographic information and consumer preferences, this study sheds light on online consumers' green behavior through extensive surveys. Cluster analysis is also employed to distinguish the categories of online consumer behavior and identify the underlying motivations of consumers within social networks. The probability of consumer clusters engaging with various categories of online green consumption is further examined through a Bayesian model. Additionally, the externality effect of social networks on online consumers' green behavior based on the live streaming economy is further simulated by the SIR model. Drawing on insights from psycholinguistics within the domain of live-streaming big data, this research provides profound insights for global managers aiming to gain a deeper comprehension of online consumers' green behavior within live-streaming programs showcasing farming products. Moreover, it offers critical support for the digital marketing of these farming products in the era of digital transformation.}

In line with a current trend in real-world practice, this research, based on the open innovation literature, challenges this assumption and argues that customers can have more engagement in big data analytics. The authors distinguish two constructs: Customer as Data Provider (CDP) and Customer as Data Analyst (CDA). The former is consistent with the mainstream view that customers serve as the data source. The latter, on the other hand, sheds light on an active role customers play in big data analytics – that is, customers participate in a co-creation process where they acquire, analyze and act on big data. Using survey data of 148 Business-to-Business (B2B) innovation projects, the authors find that both types of customer involvement facilitate B2B product innovation. Furthermore, the authors examine moderation effects of customer need tacitness and customer need diversity. Results show that customer need tacitness negatively moderates the relationship between CDP and new product performance while customer need diversity yields a positive moderation effect. Customer need tacitness is also found to positively moderate the relationship between CDA and new product performance.}

Research presents an analysis of the most recent literature focused on digital transformation in business with special emphasis on the area of marketing. Within the framework of the changes that characterize the digital revolution in the Information Society, the use of Big Data is presented as the most important challenge and innovation of recent years. The use of massive data, only accessible to the largest companies, is seen as an effective tool for building customer loyalty by using data generated by the customers themselves to predict their behavior as consumers. However, this same use of data also raises ethical questions which should be explored.}

Hence, the research analyses how 371 B2B firms from developed and emerging European countries achieve competitive advantage through green marketing strategies. Additionally, those firms are also assessed in reference to their level of engagement with environmental, social, and governance strategies. Our findings highlight that the more the engagement in green marketing by B2B firms, the greater the green competitive advantage that B2B firms in developed European markets can achieve. Hence, the study explores the relationship of B2B marketing, environmental sustainability, and corporate profitability, providing insights into how European firms can balance their financial objectives with their social and environmental responsibilities. The originality of the research stressed the need to pursue social and environmental goals and to preserve the future of people, planet, and profit through green marketing strategies.

Transportation contributes about 10% of the air pollution in India. The Indian government is taking steps to reduce air pollution by encouraging the use of electric vehicles. But, success depends on consumer's sentiment, perception and understanding towards Electric Vehicles (EV). This case study tried to capture the feeling, attitude, and emotions of Indian consumers' towards electric vehicles. The main objective of this study was to extract opinions valuable to prospective buyers (to know what is best for them), marketers (for determining what features should be advertised) and manufacturers (for deciding what features should be improved) using Deep Learning techniques (e.g Doc2Vec Algorithm, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)). Due to the very nature of social media data, big data platform was chosen to analyze the sentiment towards EV. Deep Learning based techniques were preferred over traditional machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Logistic regression and Decision tree, etc.) due to its superior text mining capabilities. Two years data (2016 to 2018) were collected from different social media platform for this case study. The results showed the efficiency of deep learning algorithms and found CNN yield better results in-compare to others. The proposed optimal model will help consumers, designers and manufacturers in their decision-making capabilities to choose, design and manufacture EV.}

Although many studies have investigated consumers’ purchase decisions regarding sustainable products, little research has addressed SSCCs and the relationship between privacy, disclosure intentions, and purchase intentions in SSCCs. These relationships are important because the use of smart technology products requires large volumes of consumers’ personal information, which can lead to severe privacy issues when adopting SSCCs. Accordingly, consumers’ preferences for features of sustainable products could conflict with their privacy concerns when they disclose personal information. Thus, we investigate the relationship between the several benefits of SSCCs and privacy-related decisions when purchasing SSCCs. We propose an extended privacy trade-off model based on three critical assumptions: two types of privacy trade-offs, bidirectional privacy reduction, and anchoring effects. We also investigate the effects of government subsidies for purchasing SSCCs regarding the relationship between governments, companies, and consumers. To validate our model, we test the effects of interaction between privacy concerns and the benefits of SSCCs on disclosure intentions and purchase intentions. Our repeated tests for the various benefits of SSCCs demonstrate the robustness of the model. Our results indicate that when consumers consider purchasing SSCCs, sustainability plays the role of the common good in trading for privacy concerns. In addition, government subsidies to encourage companies’ sustainable products increase disclosure intentions and purchase intentions. We conclude that the status of sustainability as a common goal among governments, companies, and consumers represents an opportunity to balance the privacy tensions in the sale and purchase of SSCCs.}

With precision marketing technology, firms can even target specific consumers (i.e., high- or low-valuation ones) for free trial promotion. This study focuses on firms whose costs incurred by free trials cannot be ignored. Considering the impact of the trial length and reviews posted by consumers engaging in free trials, we investigate a firm's incentives to offer free trials when launching new products, and analyze the effectiveness of conducting precision marketing. Our analysis results identify three effects (experiencer size effect, review effect, trial cost) triggered by offering free trials. The effects lead to the results that product quality, consumer uncertainty, and experiencer size jointly influence the firm's decision on the optimal trial strategy. Moreover, the degree of consumer uncertainty directly affects the complexity of the firm's optimal free trial strategy set. Unlike the intuition that precision marketing is always beneficial to the firm by targeting specific consumers, we find that the firm will not conduct precision marketing when consumer uncertainty is relatively low, or when consumer uncertainty is high but the experiencer size and product quality are relatively low.}

It delves into the challenges associated with pricing PSB and highlights the transformative impact of big data analytics on decision-making for PSB strategies. The study presents a data-driven pricing optimization model tailored for designing appropriate pricing structures for product-service bundles within the telecommunication services domain. This model integrates customer preference knowledge and involves intricate decision-making processes. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, the paper conducts a case study encompassing two design scenarios, wherein the results reveal that the model offers competitive pricing compared to existing telecommunication service providers, facilitating PSB design and decision-making. The findings from the case study indicate that the data-driven pricing optimization model can significantly aid PSB design and decision-making, leading to competitive pricing strategies that open avenues for new market exploration and ensure business sustainability. By considering both product and service features concurrently, the proposed model provides a pricing reference for optimal decision-making. The case study validates the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach within the telecommunication industry and highlights its potential for broader applications. The model's capability to generate competitive pricing strategies offers opportunities for new market exploration, ensuring business growth and adaptability.}

To comprehensively explore the implications and outcomes of this knowledge digitization trend, our study delves into its impact on the performance of high-tech firms. Based on the knowledge-based view, we develop a moderated mediation model to examine the mediating role of business model innovation and the moderating effect of entrepreneurial orientation in the relationship between knowledge digitization and firm performance. To test our hypotheses, we employ the PLS-SEM method, analyzing data from a sample of 291 Chinese high-tech firms. Our findings indicate that knowledge digitization has a positive effect on firm performance, and both types of business model innovation—novel and efficient—partially mediate the positive relationship. Additionally, entrepreneurial orientation is found to strengthen the relationship between knowledge digitization and business model innovation. However, it does not significantly moderate the connection between knowledge digitization and firm performance. Our research offers actionable insights for strategic development in the digital era and makes a substantial contribution to the existing body of knowledge in this field.}

This study employs avatar marketing and ambivalence theories to explore how VIs’ design elements (VI’s varying form realism and behavioral realism design) induce ambivalent emotions (eeriness and coolness) and impact VI marketing performance (follow and purchase intentions). Two experimental studies were conducted, using ANCOVA, multiple regression, and PROCESS macro analyses. In Study 1, utilizing contemporary VIs from the market, it was revealed that a VI exhibiting mid (vs. low) form realism triggered heightened perceptions of both eeriness and coolness, with these effects being magnified under the condition of high (vs. low) behavioral realism. In Study 2, using VIs generated through the StyleGAN AI technique, it was validated that those with high (vs. low) form realism were associated with decreased perceptions of eeriness and increased coolness, particularly when combined with high (vs. low) behavioral realism. Additionally, our findings emphasized the negative impact of eeriness and the positive influence of coolness on VI performance outcomes. In summary, our study reveals the significant role of VI interface designs in VI marketing performance, highlighting consumers' mixed emotions as crucial mediators in this context. Additionally, our findings highlight the negative impact of eeriness and the positive influence of coolness on VI performance. Its primary contribution is uncovering VIs’ interface designs as significant factors in VI marketing performance, while recognizing consumers’ ambivalent emotions as vital mediators in this relationship.}

Despite this, studies on how business to business (B2B) marketing disruptions caused by geopolitical tension and economic policy uncertainty impede industrial value creation and sustainable development, are scarce. We examine the influence of geopolitical tension and economic policy uncertainty on sustainable development through the channel of B2B marketing in the case of group of 20 (G20), group of 7 (G7) and Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) nations over 1990–2019. We utilize the Quantiles via Moments approach to analyze panel time series data due to its potential to deal with country- and region-specific heterogeneity and non-linear relationships. Our findings disclose that geopolitical tensions have a monotonic negative effect on industrial value-added triggered by B2B marketing in the BRICS countries. Contrarily, such tensions have no significant influence on industrial value-added and sustainable development in the G20 and G7 nations. Besides, industrial value-addition (foreign and domestic) augmented by B2B marketing positively affects sustainable development. Also, the effect of economic policy uncertainty on industrial value-added and sustainable development is monotonically favorable. In contrast, economic policy uncertainty-augmented industrial value-added adversely affects sustainable development steadily. Briefly, the empirical outcomes unveil significant economic implications, delineating that B2B firms are confronted with many challenges resulting from the vagaries of geopolitical and economic policy uncertainty soliciting disruption in their sustainable marketing operations.}

A crisis threatens organizational performance; therefore, a data-driven strategy will result in an efficient and timely reflection, which increases the success of crisis management. The study extends the situational crisis communication theory (SCCT) and Attribution theory frameworks built on big data and machine learning capabilities for early detection of crises in the market. This research proposes a structural model composed of a statistical and sentimental big data analytics approach. The findings of our empirical research suggest that knowledge extracted from day-to-day data communications such as email communications of a firm can lead to the sensing of critical events related to business activities. To test our model, we use a publicly available dataset containing 517,401 items belonging to 150 users, mostly senior managers of Enron during 1999 through the 2001 crisis. The findings suggest that the model is plausible in the early detection of Enron's critical events, which can support decision making in the market.}

Further, the authors use multivariate regressions to reveal which type of company-related events increase volatility in user-generated content. Results for two studies in different markets show significant volatility spillovers between the growth rates of user-generated content and stock returns. Further, specific marketing events drive the volatility in user-generated content. In particular, new product launches significantly increase the volatility in the growth rates of user-generated content, which in turn can spill over to volatility in stock returns. Moreover, the spillover effects differ in sign depending on the valence of the user-generated content in Twitter. The authors discuss the managerial implications.}

The findings show that SHRM promotes Industry 4.0-enabled dynamic marketing capabilities (IDMC); IDMC and SHRM both support implementation of circular product design strategies. Circular product design is supposed to facilitate IDMC to expand market performance. But, IDMC alone is also enough to significantly enhance market performance, despite the combined positive effect of circular product design and SHRM on market performance. These findings contribute to better understanding on what type of dynamic capabilities of organizational resources should be developed and utilized to improve market performance. The study helps firms to develop dynamic marketing capabilities such as circular product design strategies, SHRM and IDMC for helping them in improving market performance while also growing sustainably.}

We show the potential of using consumer clickstream data, an important type of big data, to create a new set of B2B analytical frameworks. In the markets where complex interactions between competitors, search intermediaries and consumers create a network, B2B relationships can be inferred from consumer search patterns, and can then be modeled to gauge the online performance. A commercial dataset from ComScore’s US panel of one million users is used to illustrate a new approach to measure and evaluate the online performance of competitors in the US airline market. The methodology and associated performance framework demonstrate the potential for new forms of market intelligence based on the visualization of market networks, online performance calculated from matrix algorithms, the measurement of the impact of search intermediaries, and the identification of latent relationships. This research makes theoretical and empirical contributions to the debate on the use of big data for B2B market analytics. B2B managers can use this approach to extend their network horizon from an egocentric to a network view of competition and map out their competitive landscape from the perspective of the customer.}

In particular, three forms of digitalization are considered – digitalization in production and logistics, digital value chains, and big data analytics. Empirical analysis utilizes the Mannheim Innovation Panel (MIP) dataset of German SMEs operating in manufacturing and service sectors. A binary probit model is separately estimated for micro, small and medium-sized firms to test if theoretically assumed positive innovation effects of digitalization occur in SMEs of different size. Empirical findings confirm that the impact of digitalization on innovation activities is heterogenous among SMEs. Furthermore, the innovation effects are modest and depend on the form of digitalization and a type of innovation. The study also explores a moderating effect of internal R&D activities. The findings suggest that the engagement in internal R&D weakness the innovation effects of digitalization. More specifically, the impact of digitalization on product and process innovations is absent in those SMEs that conduct intramural R&D, while in non-R&D SMEs, this impact is positive. Based on these findings, the study offers some theoretical and policy implications.}

To reduce this complexity, they have introduced category management practices, which consider groups of similar products (categories) that can be managed separately as single business units (SBUs). Although the concept that the store offer should be organised as a category mix and that this strategy allows for better overall store management is already consolidated, retailers still struggle to adopt an approach to the store performance measurement starting from a category level perspective. Nowadays, the available methods for measuring categories’ performance are quite limited. The current trend sees the measurement of category performance mainly based on sell-out data that are ill-equipped to fully address category management issues. Retailers should broaden their field of analysis not only by focusing on the product/sales perspective but also by including other methodologies such as shopper behaviour analysis. In this regard, the use of technology offers the retail sector new perspectives for those analysis. Therefore, we intend to contribute to the ongoing debate on the retail analytics topic by presenting a shopper behaviour analytics system for category management performance monitoring. More in detail, we could derive a new key performance indicator, category conversion power (CCP), aimed at analysing and comparing the single categories organised within the store. The research is based on a unique dataset obtained from a real-time locating system (RTLS), which allowed us to collect behavioural data togheter with sell-out data (from POS scanner). We argue that retailers could exploit this new analytical method to gain more understanding at the category level and therefore make data-driven decisions aimed at improving performance at the store level.}

The results confirm the impact of bigness of data on both negative valence (i.e., data security concern and task complexity), and positive valence (i.e., data accessibility and data diagnosticity) factors. In addition, findings show that data security concern is not a critical factor in using big data analytics. The results also show that, interestingly, at different levels of data security concern, task complexity, data accessibility, and data diagnosticity, the impact of bigness of data on big data analytics use will be varied.

A multi-method research design was used, incorporating an innovative mobile eye tracking technology and mobile fashion consumer data from Google Analytics. Digital customers’ shopping journeys on the fashion retailer’s website were mapped using data sourced from eye tracking and Google Analytics, gathered in parallel. The comparison of these shopping journeys allowed a critical evaluation of the precision and usefulness of the Google Analytics database. Google Analytics tracked only half of the digital users’ activities, whereas eye tracking data documented digital consumers’ interaction with all elements of the fashion retailer’s website.

Alternatively, the positive effect associated with social capital in data analytics is more profound when moderated by intuition-based (i.e., idiosyncratic knowledge) decision-making for managing HR selections. To test our hypotheses, we observed 30 major league baseball (MLB) teams over 6 years from 2009 to 2014 as the early phase of the ‘big data era’ that began as a result of PITCHf/x tracking systems in all MLB stadiums being implemented. Our findings suggest that the introduction of the system to all ballparks and resulting dispersion of specialized human capital across this industry facilitates firm specificity of data analytic knowledge to become generic overtime.}

abstract = {The use of social media for innovation requires firms to manage rapid information transfers, big data, and multiway communication. Yet managers lack clear insights on the way social media should be managed and current literature is dispersed across various research streams. In this article, the authors aim to develop a better understanding of how social media use should be leveraged for innovation. To achieve this objective, they build a systematic review of evidence from 177 scientific articles across four key management disciplines. They analyze research perspectives and conceptualizations of social media use for innovation and provide a framework of the drivers, contingencies and outcomes related to this topic. Next, they attempt to identify what is currently known about social media use for innovation. Last, they suggest critical areas for future inquiry on this important subject.}

What becomes crucial is to collect, process and analyse the comments expressed in the online medium, considering them as an intangible asset with an impact on tangible assets and consequences on business value. This research contributes to show the potential of the big-data environment, enhanced by the use of business intelligence tools and combined with panel econometric models. This is complemented by the elaboration of an Online Corporate Reputation Index (OCRI) to measure the economic corporate performance. The findings show that after applying the conceptual model to the banking sector, the experience associated with ethics is the intangible asset that has the most impact on the economic performance associated with each bank. In addition, the definition of an index helps to position one company in relation to another and to an entire economic sector.}

In particular, the data-driven approach, owing to the design of a recommendation system based on a big-data analytics engine, makes it possible to: i) rank the tourist preferences for the most attractive Italian destinations on Google; ii) rank the main attractions – leisure, entertainment, culture, etc. – associated with single tourist destinations, obtained from the analysis of relevant thematic websites such as Tripadvisor, Minube, and Travel365. This study is dependent on the support of big social data for the concept of tourism experience co-design, with a focus on integrated mobility services. From a technological viewpoint, analytics on big social data is enabled by relying on a cloud-based data platform, such as Amazon web services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google cloud platform (GCP). This has proved to be the key to regularly collecting, updating, and processing data from several heterogeneous sources such as Google search queries accessible via Google Trends, or any social data scraped from websites, as well as extracting relevant insights that can meet the business needs expressed by mobility companies.}

For example, a small number of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing companies have recently begun offering customers the ability to link their fitness tracking data with their genetic profile to get personalized diet and exercise recommendations. In this paper we put forward four ethical considerations that should inform potential uses of this health information. Those considerations are: the heightened risks to privacy resulting from combining sensitive data sets; the poor quality of health information that is possible at present in the realm of precision DTC genomics; the limited usefulness of the recommendations; and finally, the cultural assumptions about health and personal responsibility that are embedded within fitness genetic testing and fitness tracking. To conclude, we offer some guidance on how the benefits and risks of returning this type of health information can be weighed.}

However, the availability of big data in Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) enables training different Machine Learning (ML) models for fast and accurate predictions and decision assessments. Accordingly, this paper proposes an ML-Based Simulation Metamodeling Method (MLBSM) to facilitate DT-based decision-making for dynamic production scheduling in complex Stochastic Flexible Job Shop (SFJS) environments. The proposed MLBSM integrates three modules: a novel data vectorizing method (SPBM), multi-output Adaptive Boosting Regressor (ABR) models, and a new statistical risk evaluation method. SPBM converts unstructured production log data into numerical vectors for ABR training by calculating numeric penalty scores for each job based on the position of operations in the schedule queue. Each trained ABR predicts mean job completion times for various dynamic scenarios based on shift schedules. The risk evaluation method estimates the standard deviation of job completion times and calculates the delay probability scores for each job, aiding DT in promptly evaluating production schedules. Working seamlessly together, MLBSM modules present a novel way of using production log data for ML training and ultimately bypassing several computationally intensive simulation replications. In this research, a simulation model generates the synthetic MES data, focusing on the machining process at a photolithography workstation in the semiconductor manufacturing. Experiments demonstrate the MLBSM’s accuracy and efficiency, predicting high-risk jobs with over 80% recall and being at least 70 times faster than conventional simulation runs. Sensitivity analyses also confirm the MLBSM’s consistency under different workstation conditions.}

However, one of the current challenges is the perspectives used to understand attitudes toward low carbon consumption vary, and the research methodology relies heavily on traditional methods with a time lag. This paper presents a computational model that combines Sentiment Classification (SC), the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, and VOSviewer clustering to show persuasive topics from consumers. We illustrate the validity of the model and apply it to new energy vehicle posts from social media platforms (e.g., Zhihu) between January 2022 and March 2022. Finally, we observe 14 clusters with sentiment and find that consumers' attitudes are polarized, positive stakeholders consider the long-term development and macroscopic aspects, while negative stakeholders believe that there are real problems with new energy vehicles, especially batteries and charging, and then we provide some suggestions to the government, manufacturers, and investors.}

To address this objective, we collected data from 239 managers and empirically examined the relationships in the proposed model. The results reveal that, while data variety and velocity positively enhance firm innovation performance, data volume has no significant impact. The finding that data volume does not play a critical role in enhancing firm innovation performance contributes novel insights to the literature by contradicting the prevalent belief that big data is better data. Moreover, the findings reveal that data velocity plays a more important role in improving firm innovation performance than other big data characteristics.}

This paper contributes to the burgeoning literature on mobile targeting by investigating the effects of customer mobile habits and social capital on firm sales. Leveraging unique customer mobile browsing data from a major telecom service provider in China, we use a Bayesian SEM (structural equation modeling) approach to show that customer mobile habits and social capital exert significant influences on customers' purchase intentions. Specifically, customers who engage in more hedonic mobile behaviors, such as social networking, video browsing, and gaming are associated with a higher probability of purchasing, controlling for the usage of communications apps including messaging and emailing apps, and the usage of functional apps, such as maps, living services, and app market apps. Additionally, our research results reveal a significant positive effect of social capital on firms' sales performance. These findings offer important insights that are often missing from organizational targeting campaign designs in terms of targeting both the right customers and the right business alliance partners and enable a better understanding of managerial and decision-making implications in the context of the B2B market in general.}

We provide links for downloading parsed 10-K files and suggest software for textual analysis. The framework offers B2B marketers a rich alternative to primary data and proprietary datasets. Ongoing advances in AI-enabled NLP text analysis further increase the future value of the approach for B2B marketers.}

The research involved 93 production centres of a multinational company with presence in more than 10 countries. The theoretical model was tested by using structural equation modelling. The results show that business digitisation can boost the development of value activities, but companies will only unleash this potential if they incorporate a digital organisational culture.

This paper responds to this gap by systematically reviewing the studies on this subject to provide a macro picture to identify the existing state of research, potential synergies, differences, and direction for future research. This review includes articles from 34 journals, covering 125 articles in total. The paper finds that the research on luxury revolves around four major themes: branding, consumption drivers, counterfeits, and marketing strategy. The paper then integrates various studies into these themes, enabling it to provide key insights for each domain, while examining their research design permits the analysis of the industry, geography, and methodological approaches. The paper finds that there are multiple theoretical paradoxes in the existing literature. Luxury research requires theoretical integration, should use real-world data to generate insights, and pay attention towards managerially relevant problems. The paper synthesizes implications across studies, identifies overlap and replication, understands disagreements and issues, and outlines potential research areas.}

The proposed model was assessed by surveying 319 corporations. Our findings are that ML use, big data analytics maturity, platform maturity, top management support, and process complexity are, to some extent, drivers of ML BV. We also find that platform maturity has, to some degree, a moderator influence between ML use and ML BV, and between big data analytics maturity and ML BV.

Simultaneously, the data and insights that can inform consumer attitudes and behaviors often reside outside of firms' direct control. Consciously incorporating these interdependent factors into firms' decision-making is essential for adaptability and sustainable profitability. Building on the “outside-in” perspective, we propose that firm strategies should be informed through the lens of the marketing ecosystem that considers the interrelated and dynamic megatrends. By leveraging advances in data and technology, firms can sense-make the marketplace by extracting insights from massive amounts of diverse consumer data with modern-day analytics. By mapping out the megatrends with marketing analytics, firms can 1) more accurately predict consumers' changing preferences and formulate appropriate strategies to engage with them; and 2) become more market-adaptable and competitive in the present and the future. To deliver sustainably compelling value to customers, firms should adopt an ecosystem mindset and cooperate with various stakeholders. A broad-thinking, agile, and humble firm culture can enable the development of more robust outside-in capabilities. We elaborate on the megatrends in the interconnected world of the marketing ecosystem, and propose emerging research directions in each area.}

abstract = {With the acceleration of economic globalization, competition among manufacturing industries has become increasingly fierce. Automobile manufacturing has always been a critical investment and development industry in different countries. For the automobile manufacturing industry, the logistics scheduling problem of automobile production is affects automobile manufacturing enterprises’ ability to compete. This paper discusses disruptive technologies, such as AI, IoT, Big data, etc., to solve production problems. Therefore, production logistics systems research is essential to automobile manufacturing enterprises, to improve production efficiency, reduce production costs, and increase enterprises’ economic benefits. We present three kinds of mathematical models designed and calculated by a genetic algorithm, aimed at the Pareto solution set to solve multi-objective optimization, as well as designs for a new contrast flow, which can quickly find the optimal solution and simulate the algorithm.}

Computational intelligence (CI) is the ability of a machine to learn specific tasks via data or experimental observation for understanding and analysing customer behavioural patterns. Thus, this study explores how e-customers may intend to adopt CI in e-commerce within the boundaries of IM. Using online surveys, the primary data were collected from 315 e-customers of e-commerce businesses. Subsequently, the quantitative approach was used to analyse the data. The finding reveals that using a variety of techniques such as fuzzy logic, learning theory, evolutionary computation, genetic algorithms, and deep learning, CI predicts e-customer behaviour in a changing environment. Such a prediction results in desirable impacts, including more successful IM campaigns and retention actions. Further, CI uses a computational thinking approach, including the specification of the problem, algorithmic expression, solution implementation, and solution evaluation, for the identification and classification of stock-keeping units. This allows e-customers to compare the attributes of similar products.}

Intense competition among vloggers and channel owners for advertising revenue and sponsorship has led to the increasing use of clickbait-style thumbnails and titles with exaggerated sentiments to boost click-through rates. Drawing on cognitive schema theory, we analyzed the sentiments in video titles, thumbnails, and captions to examine their effects on video views. Our analysis of 16,215 YouTube video covers reveals that strong sentiments in thumbnails, whether positive or negative, lead to more views, whereas strong sentiments in captions have the opposite effect. Video titles with positive rather than negative sentiments generate more views. Sentiment markers such as punctuation, all capitals, and emoticons all contribute to more clicks. These findings highlight that the use of sentiment in video covers can have both a positive and a negative effect, which has significant implications for video marketing.}

abstract = {While industrial marketing often comprises a process that, at least in principle, mirrors Bayesian reasoning, the notion of Bayesian inference has predominantly been utilized in the marketing field as a methodological tool. This article suggests that the practice of industrial marketing itself should be (re)conceptualized as a Bayesian process of belief-updating that entails a continuous cognitive cycle of formulation of hypotheses (i.e., beliefs about the market) and the subsequent updating of those hypotheses through exposure to market evidence (e.g., data from the market). A Bayesian perspective on industrial marketing enables a synthesis of a broad body of extant research as well as a focus on the interconnection between executives' market beliefs (theories-in-use) and belief-updating (assessing the validity of those beliefs in view of market evidence). A view of industrial marketing as a Bayesian process not only enhances our understanding in general but also fosters insights into market learning in uncertain and volatile situations. A Bayesian conceptualization suggests a new understanding of industrial marketing that also informs a typology of marketing approaches. We outline opportunities for developing a better understanding of the Bayesian foundation of industrial marketing.}

Confronted with a big amount of data external and internal to their organization's managers strive for predictive data analysis that enables insight into the future, but even more for prescriptive ones that use algorithms to prepare recommendations for current and future actions. Most of the decision-making techniques use deterministic machine learning (ML) techniques but unfortunately, they do not take into account the variety and volatility of decision-making situations and do not allow for a more flexible approach, i.e., adjusted to changing environmental conditions or changing management priorities. A way to better adapt ML tools to the needs of decision-makers is to use swarm intelligence ML (SIML) methods that provide a set of alternative solutions that allow matching actions with the current decision-making situation. Thus, applying SIML methods in managerial decision-making is conceptualized as a company capability as it allows for systematic alignment of allocating resources decisions vis-à -vis changing decision-making conditions. The study focuses on the customer churn management as the area of applying SIML techniques to managerial decision-making. The objectives are twofold: to present the specific features and the role of SIML methods in customer churn management and to test if a modified SIML algorithm may increase the effectiveness of churn-related segmentation and improve decision-making process. The empirical study uses publicly available customer data related to digital markets to test if and how SIML methods facilitate managerial decision-making with regard to customers potentially leaving the company in the context of changing conditions. The research results are discussed with regard to prior studies on applying ML techniques to decision-making and customer churn management studies. We also discuss the place of presented analytical approach in the literature on dynamic capabilities, especially big data-driven capabilities.}

Uncertainty over how different social networking sites can support brands is one of the crucial reasons for the delayed acceptance of social media (SM) in business-to-business (B2B) transactions. SM possesses immense potential in relation to gathering customer data and assisting B2B marketers. Therefore, this study reviewed SM usage in the B2B context, based on 294 selected articles. The methodology included bibliometric analysis to identify the impact of SM usage in the B2B domain and content analysis to perform a thematic assessment. Our analysis found that many B2B firms cannot leverage SM’s potential to its fullest compared to business-to-customer (B2C) firms. However, SM can help B2B marketers build their brand presence and trust globally, ultimately helping them find potential customers and build relationships with global supply chain providers.}

In the evolving digital data rich market environment, customer-based resources, a subset of a firm's market-based resources, are becoming increasingly important as potential sources of competitive advantage. Customer information assets refer to information of economic value about customers owned by a firm. Information analysis capabilities are complex bundles of skills and knowledge embedded in a firm's organizational processes employed to generate customer knowledge from customer information assets. Customer insights or knowledge is a firm's extent of understanding of customers that informs its business decisions. Building on the resource-based, capabilities-based and knowledge-based views of the firm, resource advantage theory of competition, and the outside-in and inside-out approaches to strategy, this article presents a market resources-based view of strategy, competitive advantage and performance.

This study develops a data-driven DSC, including an online manufacturer and an offline retailer with stochastic demand. Then it discusses the effects of the selling price, wholesale price, stock-out-based substitution rate, Data-Driven Marketing (DDM), and two channels’ sensitivity of product quality on the optimal decisions (quality improvement effort, online inventory level, and offline order quantity), and the optimal expected profits. It also analyzes the coordination of the manufacturer’s buyback contract. This work is mainly concluded as follows: (1) Increases in DDM quality can increase inventory levels in both channels and efforts to enhance quality, but they can also lower customer return rates, which makes sense. However, it is not always true that DDM quality positively affects the total supply chain expected profit. (2) The decline of one channel’s stock-out-based substitution rate can raise its inventory level but decrease the inventory level of the competitive channel. Contrarily, the selling price of one channel is adversely connected with the inventory level of the competitive channel, which extends some existing studies under a decentralized decision. (3) The increase of sensitivity of product quality can lead to the growth of quality improvement efforts (consistent with previous literature) and the reduction of consumer return rate. (4) The manufacturer’s buyback contract can well coordinate both members under stochastic demand for Pareto-optimality. Finally, this study proposes some managerial implications and further research directions.}

Based on theories related to congruent explanations and four experiments (n = 550 in total), this study found that, first, consumers' willingness to pay for products endorsed by VEs from a different COO does not differ significantly when the COO of the product is not considered. Second, when the COO of both the VE and the product is considered, people's willingness to pay increases significantly when the two COOs are consistent; when they are inconsistent, the effect of domestic VE endorsing foreign products is greater than that of foreign VE endorsing domestic products. Third, the effect of VE–product COO consistency on consumers' willingness to pay is significantly weaker when a less human-like VE is adopted. Finally, the effect of VE–product COO consistency on consumer willingness to pay is mediated first through the parallel mediation of perceived VE image and product value, and then through the sequential mediation of product attitude. This study has important theoretical and practical implications for companies as they design VEs, grasp target markets and develop individualised marketing promotion strategies.}

abstract = {The new business challenges in the B2B sector are determined by connected ecosystems, where data-driven decision making is crucial for successful strategies. At the same time, the use of digital marketing as a communication and sales channel has led to the need and use of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems to correctly manage company information. The understanding of B2B traditional Marketing strategies that use CRMs that work with Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been studied, however, research focused on the understanding and application of these technologies in B2B digital marketing is scarce. To cover this gap in the literature, this study develops a literature review on the main academic contributions in this area. To visualize the outcomes of the literature review, the results are then analyzed using a statistical approach known as Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) under the homogeneity analysis of variance by means of alternating least squares (HOMALS) framework programmed in the R language. The research results classify the types of CRMs and their typologies and explore the main techniques and uses of AI-based CRMs in B2B digital marketing. In addition, a discussion, directions and propositions for future research are presented.}

Simultaneously, numerous companies are implementing sustainable business models (SBMs), expecting to integrate sustainability considerations and increase competitive advantage. These two megatrends—digitalization and sustainability—are radically changing firms. However, the relationship between digitalization and the implementation of SBMs is yet to be investigated in detail. This is a key issue, as digital tools could assist companies in transforming their current business models toward sustainability. Through a literature review, we explore the link between digitalization and SBMs, illustrating the main potential impacts of digitalization for each block of SBM and propose a list of the potential benefits that digitalized SBMs can bring. We identify these potential benefits and elaborate on them considering their economic, social, and environmental impacts. Moreover, our study identifies a potential virtuous circle generated by digitalization, while highlighting the necessary alignment of digital tools and key business factors to attain economic, social, and environmental value.}

Using actual viewers’ behavioral big data, comprising of 16,204 real-time messages and 5,540 virtual gifts, this study combines machine learning techniques and structural equation modelling (SEM) to examine the influence of viewer value perception on gifting behavior through the mediation effect of satisfaction. The results suggest that satisfaction fully mediates the effects of viewer value perception on gifting amount and partially mediates the effects of value perception on gifting number.

Adopting Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies facilitates sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) with the precise decision-making of supply chain activities and the realisation of circular development. However, according to the bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review of articles related to “SSCM”, few frameworks with I4.0 technologies are found to empower SSCM under circular economy (CE) logic. Thus, this article proposes a conceptual framework of I4.0 technologies-embedded SSCM, which takes advantage of five kinds of emerging digital technologies, including cloud services, artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics (BDA), blockchain technology (BT), and internet of things (IoT). The CAB2IN framework is based on the technologies mentioned above alongside the design, manufacturing, delivering, using, and end-of-life stages of products and services to meet the requirements of reducing material usage, remanufacturing, reusing, and recycling. This paper's contribution lies in indicating the trends of SSCM in the era of Industry 4.0 and proposing CAB2IN to creatively establish the virtual side of circular SSCM, which leverages the data generated in each stage to assist sustainable decision-making. CAB2IN illuminates several research directions for future studies of digitalised SSCM under the perspective of CE. The case of Company S illustrates the application of CAB2IN in the healthcare supply chain. This paper also summarises insightful directions of digitalised SSCM under the proposed circular framework.}

E-recruitment is an emerging and polymorphous phenomenon that starts with identification of candidates on social networks, continues through gamification of recruitment and job interviews with chatbots, and ends by matching a candidate and a job using artificial intelligence. These technologies are particularly useful for social businesses looking to recruit not only skilled people, but above all employees who have behaviors and values that match their mission. The methodology is based on grounded theory, participant observation, and qualitative data collection. A multiple case study is designed to analyze, compare, and combine several technologies dedicated to recruitment: (1) a social network with LinkedIn, (2) a MOOC with Udacity, (3) a serious game called Reveal from L'Oréal, (4) a chatbot called Ari from TextRecruit, and (5) a massive data analysis matching system with Randstad.tech. The discussion examines the respective performance and limits of these tools and their convergence via a progressive integration that leads to an uberization of recruitment. Managerial recommendations are formulated to support recruiters in their adoption of e-recruitment.}

While the initial catalyst for transformative marketing was the desire of customers for more meaningful engagement, the global impact of great crises (or mega disruptions) has accelerated the evolution of transformative marketing. With a focus on business-to-business (B2B) marketing, this article aims to offer transformative marketing insights to support B2B marketers in preparing for, navigating in, and recovering from great crises using the great lockdown that transpired during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as a case. To do so, this article employs the marketing mix as an organizing framework and performs an integrative review of practice and scholarly articles relating to B2B marketing and COVID-19. In doing so, this article delivers a seminal integrative review that is informed by both practice and scholarly sources in B2B marketing, thereby establishing its methodological novelty and value. More importantly, this article highlights “what” is necessary and “how” B2B marketers can (re)configure the product, price, place, promotion, people, process, and physical evidence elements of their marketing activities to steer their B2B marketing operations toward success in a world where global crises are a commonplace. Therefore, this article contributes in two major ways: the first from a theoretical perspective, by extending the theoretical generalizability of transformative marketing, and the second from a managerial standpoint, by shedding light on practitioner issues and offering practical suggestions for B2B marketers to prepare for, navigate in, and recover from great crises in the new normal.}

On one hand, the firms endeavour to adjust their marketing strategies to maximize their profits; on the other hand, the retailer and manufacturer have their own risk preferences, which will affect their decision making in omni-channel marketing strategies. We address these emerging issues by conducting a theoretical mean-risk analysis. We find that the optimal online marketing investment is not always larger than the offline counterpart, even when the online ads’ influence is large. We uncover that the integrated omni-channel marketing effect is a critical factor which affects the expected profits derived from both channels. Furthermore, we extend the analysis by considering the risk preferences of the retailer and manufacturer as well as demand uncertainty and correlation. Important managerial insights are generated.}

To address this gap, this review conducted a combination of bibliometric and thematic analyses on 861 CE articles published in 377 Scopus-indexed journals between 2006 and 2020. As a result, this review reveals the major trends in article, author, country, and journal performance, as well as the past, present, and future thematic trends of CE research, and thus, provides a one stop, state-of-the-art overview of CE that marketing scholars can rely on to position and design future CE research.}

This research stands at the forefront of this burgeoning field, dissecting the unique impact of human versus virtual influencers on consumer attitudes toward service failures, including forgiveness propensity, behavioral responses, and punishment intention. Through a series of experimental studies, the research uncovers a nuanced preference for virtual influencers, who elicit higher levels of forgiveness, more positive behavioral responses, and lower punitive intentions during service failures. These findings are mediated by mind perception and responsibility attribution, and are moderated by familiarity, thereby unveiling a complex interplay of psychological processes. The study's contributions transcend mere observations, offering a theoretical framework with empirical testing that integrates consumer psychology with the emergent phenomenon of virtual influencers. The insights gleaned from this research not only enhance academic understanding of the dynamics between influencer types and consumer reactions but also provide actionable strategies for marketers. By bridging theory and practice, this study carves a new path in influencer marketing research, particularly illuminating how to leverage influencer types to mitigate negative consumer reactions due to service failures.}

This demand has led organisations to advance their technologies via gamification and improve customer experiences and involvement. Hence, this study examined how retail store cross-boundary alliances and gamified marketing methods impact the implementation of online-merge-offline (OMO) virtual-physical fusion services from customers' viewpoints. An evaluation model was developed by integrating Chou's eight-core Octalysis framework for gamification and decision-making approaches. Furthermore, an online survey performed in Taiwan generated 550 valid responses. The empirical data were subsequently analysed with DEMATEL to determine the interconnections among evaluation indicators and construct an influential network relation map (INRM). The indicators' influence weights were ascertained via DANP. Unpredictability (Unp) was ranked first, followed by avoidance (Avo), epic meaning (Epi), scarcity (Sca), empowerment (Emp), social influence (Soc), ownership (Own), and accomplishment (Acc). Both Acc and Unp were the most and least significant factors, respectively. Optimal gamified marketing approaches positively influenced customers' repurchase intentions, shopping experiences, and retail loyalty. Overall, retail stores seeking to apply cross-boundary alliances and gamified marketing methods can benefit from the empirical outcomes to incorporate efficient OMO virtual-physical fusion services.}

abstract = {Companies neither fully exploit the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI), nor that of Machine Learning (ML), its most prominent method. This is true in particular of marketing, where its possible use extends beyond mere segmentation, personalization, and decision-making. We explore the drivers of and barriers to AI and ML in marketing by adopting a dual strategic and behavioral focus, which provides both an inward (AI and ML for marketers) and an outward (AI and ML for customers) perspective. From our mixed-method approach (a Delphi study, a survey, and two focus groups), we derive several research propositions that address the challenges facing marketing managers and organizations in three distinct domains: (1) Culture, Strategy, and Implementation; (2) Decision-Making and Ethics; (3) Customer Management. Our findings contribute to better understanding the human factor behind AI and ML, and aim to stimulate interdisciplinary inquiry across marketing, organizational behavior, psychology, and ethics.}

Against this backdrop, this study was aimed at investigating the antecedents of marketing analytics success (MAS) and its overall effects on strategic business value and profitability. Drawing on quality-dominant logic through the dynamic capability lens, this study yielded a model that, on the basis of data, model, and deployment quality, explains the achievement of MAS and the avoidance of business failure. This study, the data for which were gathered in Australia from 314 sample elements, shows that MAS significantly contributes to strategic business value and profitability. Such findings present a theoretically rigorous and practically relevant framework of MAS capable of mitigating the causes of business failure by harnessing analytics insights.}

Three different, though interconnected, thematic clusters are discovered and analysed, respectively focusing on big-data analytic capabilities as crucial drivers of OA, the relationship between digitalization and agility at a supply chain level, and the role of information technology capabilities in improving OA. By adopting a dynamic capabilities perspective, this study overcomes the traditional view, which mainly considers digital capabilities enablers of OA, rather than as possible outcomes. Our findings reveal that, in addition to being complex, the relationship between digitalization and OA has a bidirectional character.

Four attributes were introduced to describe organizational identification: knowledge, perception, linking, and future attributes. Results revealed that out of 1,911 members, 56.67% of them are considered “proactive citizens”, 32.50% are “ambivalent citizens”, and 10.83% are “disengaged citizens”. Sensitivity analysis shows that the proposed approach is robust to changes in the model parameters. Characteristics of the types of citizens were discussed, and some managerial insights were outlined. Succinctly, this work contributes to the literature by exploring the integration of PFS to k-means clustering to characterize the extent of organizational identification of organizational stakeholders when presented with a new organizational identity – a relatively novel application in organization science.}

We searched website, which publishes job advertisements, related to Industry 4.0, and performed text mining analysis on the data collected from those job advertisements. Analysis of the job advertisements revealed that most of them were for full time entry; associate and mid-senior level management positions and mainly came from the United States and Germany. Text mining analysis resulted in two groups of job profiles. The first group of job profiles was focused solely on the knowledge related to Industry 4.0: cyberphysical systems and the Internet of things for robotized production; and smart production design and production control. The second group of job profiles was focused on more general knowledge areas, which are adapted to Industry 4.0: supply change management, customer satisfaction, and enterprise software. Topic mining was conducted on the extracted phrases generating various multidisciplinary job profiles. Higher educational institutions, human resources professionals, as well as experts that are already employed or aspire to be employed in Industry 4.0 organizations, would benefit from the results of our analysis.}

A new technological mix of mobile-apps, big data, blockchain, AI, cloud computing and digital platforms is taking place with unprecedented speed and is forcing traditional banks to consider this technology to form part of new collaborative value creation networks, such as digital business ecosystems (DBEs). Traditional payment habits based on cash and credit or debit cards are being replaced by new innovative formats of mobile instant payment among end users (P2P). Through a single case study – Bizum's DBE – the purpose of this research is to explore how successful was the defensive strategy developed by traditional banking entities with the objective to lead the new mobile instant payment ecosystem in Spain. The findings show that Bizum's DBE is helping traditional banking entities to create a superior digital value that is being adopted very quickly by a huge number of users in Spain. The main contribution of this study is the complete explanation of how a winning strategy of creation and development of a DBE can: i) ensure survival of incumbents in the face of threats from digital disruptive actors, and ii) transform consumer habits very quickly, due to the superior created value as a new solution for that need. We used the novel reformulation of the Modularity Theory (Baldwin, 2020c) which can be considered as a first step for a DBE-specific theorisation and supportive framework to understand the deep social impact of the different network effects generated.}

This study aims to identify the major underlying problems associated with pharmaceutical supply chains (PSC), and the mechanisms through which these issues are happening and propose the main solutions to them. This research also assesses the value of the data extracted from social media.
Methodology
This study extracted data from Twitter and combines the power of an effective software (Python) with expert analysis (Delphi study in three rounds) to identify the key issues in pharmaceutical industry that have been neglected by decision makers. Furthermore, combination of the two powerful tools (Python and Delphi) is another merit of this work since it is a sophisticated method.
Findings
This research has recognized that there are four major key problems that are highly critical and need urgent attention and proposes the key resolutions to these issues. The expert panel believed that the results from Twitter data are very helpful and gives decision makers new insight into pharmaceutical supply chain.
Originality
Several items gathered this study make it unique. First, by using social media, this paper has discovered the underlying problems of PSC that are not usually detected by PSC management systems or are being neglected by them. Second, through a Delphi study, this research discovered the patterns of these issues and mechanisms by which they are formed and also provided new effective solutions. Many other papers have just stated that social media is useful for supply chains, but the vast majority of them did not actually conduct an in-depth analysis on social media to discover problems in pharmaceutical supply chain, and very few studies explored the mechanisms by which those problems were formed.}

To facilitate the adoption, we present a topic modeling analysis of literature in top academic journals, focusing on the abstracts and the method sections across all areas of marketing interfacing management research, which use AI techniques to examine consumption-related questions. We also map consumer research employing AI techniques onto Schmitt’s Consumer Psychology of Brands. We find that over 90% of consumer-relevant research using AI techniques has taken place since 2009; of that, over 50% has taken place between 2019 and 2020.

Therefore, scholars and practitioners seek to make sense of how this phenomenon can be addressed concerning companies’ maturity level of supply chain smartness and sustainability. This paper proposes a novel hybrid methodology combining the Best-Worst Method (BWM) and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) to assess the level of maturity for supply chain smartness and sustainability by weighting the functions of supply chain management. A twin-QFD technique is used to obtain a conceptual design to determine the relationship between the functions of supply chain smartness tools and sustainability indicators to assess the level of maturity, whereas the BWM is used to determine the weights of the functions of supply chain management. A case study in the automotive manufacturing industry is applied to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. The findings disclose the prominent smart technologies (simulation, big data analytics, cloud computing) and sustainability indicators (costs, lead time, and damage and loss) in integrating Industry 4.0 technologies and sustainable supply chain practices. Findings also suggest a guideline to compare the current and targeted levels of smartness and sustainability maturity. This study provides insights for scholars and practitioners and contributes to the body of knowledge by evaluating companies’ maturity of digital transformation and sustainable practices in the supply chain functions.}

However, VRTE has insignificant mediation effect on the relationship between perceived trust and performance expectancy. This is the same with performance expectancy that has insignificant indirect effect from VRTE to behavioural intentions. Furthermore, parasocial interaction is confirmed to moderate the relationship between performance expectancy and behavioural intentions. The current research presents several theoretical implications in the research field and management implications for sustainable hotel managers and recommendations for future research directions.}

Although sustainability research within B2B marketing scholarship has increased in recent years, the B2B literature relating to the Sustainable Development Goals remains fragmented and underexposed. To address this important oversight, a systematic literature review of the B2B marketing literature (n = 58) is undertaken which demonstrates if and how B2B scholarship is currently engaging with the Sustainable Development Goals. The findings and analyses highlight that although the B2B scholarship has varying levels of engagement with some of the goals, there is vast opportunity for B2B Marketing scholars to engage more proactively and strategically with the Sustainable Development Goals. Building on the call for courageous research and employing the ‘Observe, bridge and challenge” model (Lindgreen et al., 2021), we develop broad research approaches as well as specific research questions to catalyse scholarship at the interface of B2B Marketing and the Sustainable Development Goals.}

This paper examines the timing effect between government measures and panic buying. Three studies were undertaken to understand the timing effect and identify a connection between timed measures and consumer behaviours. Semantic analysis, secondary data search, and big data analytics were deployed to address the research aim. Although claiming a causal relationship is cautioned, the findings reveal a connection between timing of government measures and panic buying.

Therefore, the regeneration of business models is becoming an increasingly crucial factor for survival in the digital age. This study develops a process model for digital innovations-driven business model regeneration based on the design science research approach. For this purpose, the existing models and cases in the business model innovation (BMI) literature are examined and the empirical data are collected using semi-structured interviews to complement and validate this knowledge. The collected data are then analyzed and a digital innovations-driven business model regeneration method is developed. The proposed model is demonstrated with a real case. This study extends the BMI literature. The proposed process model can be used by strategic managers to analyze the impacts of potential digital innovations on their current business models and regenerate their business model. Therefore, it can help companies to be able to gain a competitive advantage over their competitors or sustain their business against technological developments.}

To accomplish this, a novel method involving a literature review and Pythagorean fuzzy-Delphi has initially been employed to identify and screen categorized lists of Industry 4.0 Disruptive Technologies (IDTs) and their impacts on pharmaceutical CSC. Subsequently, the weight of finalized impacts and the performance score of finalized IDTs have simultaneously been measured via a novel version of Pythagorean fuzzy SECA (Simultaneously Evaluation of Criteria and Alternatives). Then, the priority of each intervention for disruptive impacts of Industry 4.0 has been determined via the Hanlon method. This is one of the first papers to provide in-depth insights into advancing the study of the disruptive action of Industry 4.0 technologies cross-fertilizing CE throughout pharmaceutical SCs in the emerging economy of Iran. The results indicate that digital technologies such as Big Data Analytics, Global Positioning Systems, Enterprise Resource Planning, and Digital Platforms are quite available in the Irans' pharmaceutical industry. These technologies, along with four available interventions, e.g., environmental regulations, subsidy, fine, and reward, would facilitate moving towards a lean, agile, resilient, and sustainable supply chain through the efficient utilization of resources, optimized waste management, and substituting the human workforce by machines.}

However, the impact of demand information sharing on the evolution of organic farming is still less understood. Consequently, we use the evolutionary game approach to study the long-term effect of information sharing on the producers’ organic farming adoption based on the profit matrix. Considering that the retailer has some private demand information, the basic models as Stackelberg games in normal forms consisting of one retailer and one producer under information symmetry and information asymmetry are established to form the profit matrix. We also employ the method of cooperation on the forecast to realize information sharing and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of information sharing. Then, we analyze the evolutionarily stable strategy of several producers and retailers playing as a two-player game. The results indicate that (Conversion, Sharing) equilibrium can be easier to achieve with higher customers’ green preference and lower effort cost, whereas (Conversion, Nonsharing) equilibrium can be easier to achieve with more accurate forecast information. More importantly, a higher initial conversion state prompts the retailers to evolve to sharing more quickly and vice versa.}

This paper demonstrates that digital technology is impacting at five key levels audit firms especially the audit role as a governance mechanism. Digitalization will improve the audit relevance (1) allowing audit firms to extend their offers by proposing new services (2). It will also improve the audit quality mainly by analysing all data’s customer (3). Finally, with the digitalization a new auditor profile emerges (4), enabling the culture of innovation within audit firms (5). Thus, the firm governance will be improved but the managers ‘discretionary power will be limited. This research highlights the importance of implementing digital strategies to provide regulators with the necessary modifications that need to occur for audit standards. It should enable Business School and universities to adapt their training programs according to the audit firms’ expectations.}

The ability of getting updates from several sources of news channels in a single user news feed, the extreme ease of providing feedbacks on those news posts using gesture-based reactions, send and share messages among people are some of the main reasons for its increasing popularity in the perspective of attaining news. Politics has always been a ubiquitous topic in the world. Sri Lanka was in a war on terrorism for nearly three decades, followed by a governance (2005–2015) led by the same political party which was alleged for autocracy and lasted for nearly a decade has influenced the citizens’ political conviction heavily. On such a background, the “Good-Governance” (2015–2019) which is a coalition government, trounced the ruling government at the presidential election held by then, which they claimed to direct Sri Lanka towards a sustainable, stable, responsible and moral society with necessary constitutional amendments guaranteeing democracy to all ethnic groups eradicating corruption, wastage and fraud. The interest and motivation of this study builds up to discover whether there are any significant trends in the Sri Lankan political context following this transformation, in the perspective of the general public. Facebook user reactions on news posts have been used for this study as the data source. The analysis of this study reveals an increasing trend of user reactions in politics from 2011 to 2018. Further, it is identified that the present government (2015–2019) has a decreasing trend of user reactions over the past years (2011–2015) in the sight of its citizens, although they pledged for a better governance. On the contrary, the previous government has an increasing trend even though they were overpowered by the “Good-Governance” for its alleged unscrupulous ruling.}

This research employs a tripartite methodology, combining Google Trends analysis, bibliometric analysis, and a systematic literature review, to gauge both public and research interest in social robots within the healthcare domain. In the Google Trends analysis, search query data for “Social Robots” was retrieved, encompassing both “all categories” and the specific “health” category. Seasonal effects on relative search volumes (RSV) were assessed through the cosinor model. The analysis confirmed statistically significant seasonal patterns in RSV for “social robots” within the “health” category. Conversely, for the broader “all categories,” only the intercept showed significance, while sinw and cosw were deemed insignificant. For bibliometric analysis, the global literature on “robotics” and “healthcare” was examined in the SCOPUS database. From the extensive pool of publications, 144 relevant studies were identified out of 4037 publications. These studies were further analyzed using VOSviewer, providing insights into recent trends and hot topics concerning social robots in healthcare. The systematic literature review focused on 46 articles published from 2019 to the end of 2023. The findings revealed a lack of consensus on the drivers, barriers, and outcomes associated with social robot acceptance and human-robot interaction (HRI). The study systematically maps the existing research on these aspects, introducing a novel categorization and presenting the concept of a “robot user's ecosystem.” This concept emphasizes the imperative involvement of all stakeholders in the development and understanding of social robots. Ultimately, this methodological approach not only identifies nine research gaps in the current literature but also formulates numerous research questions to guide future researchers in this domain.}

A study at Phuket's Amari Hotel seamlessly integrated customer journey analysis with text mining, yielding a robust hotel equity model. Notably, the findings unveiled the substantial influence of factors like location and community value on hotel equity, often overlooked in previous studies. Remarkably, the hotel accommodation room emerged as the dominant touchpoint (81 %). These insights can fuel the transformation of marketing strategies and brand equity assessment.

Since MNC subsidiaries typically suffer from “liabilities of foreignness”, they depend on skilled marketing professionals who possess a deep understanding of host country markets to implement these marketing innovations. However, the value that these individuals can create for MNC subsidiaries vis-à-vis domestic firms and under which host country market conditions their B2B marketing skills are most valuable is poorly understood. We integrate mechanisms from research on value creation through marketing innovation in MNC subsidiaries into strategic human capital theory and predict higher value creation to translate into salary premiums for these individuals compared to when they would work for domestic firms. Moreover, we argue that these salary premium effects depend on the innovativeness of the host country competition which challenges MNC subsidiaries and makes marketing innovation even more salient. We test and support our hypotheses using employer-employee data for 25,374 marketing professionals from 2010 to 2012 in Denmark. The findings have broad relevance for the management of strategic human capital management in the creation of marketing innovation.}

Business organizations function under social norms, and to establish an ethical identity, they must show corporate ethical responsibility, embrace ethical standards, and maintain open communication with suppliers. While an organization's reputation is impacted by the absence of an ethical identity, its financial success is unaffected. Extant literature has not thrown a spotlight on social and environmental performance which indicates that less focus has been given by academics than by practitioners. To fill the lacuna in the existing literature, this study examines the relationships between corporate ethical identity, corporate brand identity, social and environmental performance. The study uses a deductive research approach and develops hypotheses which are further tested using variance based structural equation modeling. The study offers a distinctive contribution to ethics theory and stakeholder theory by showing that developing an ethical identity requires more than just adhering to moral guidelines and upholding open communication. Companies must show that they are ethically responsible towards society. The study provides evidence of the influence corporate brand identity has on environmental and social performance. The findings can be useful in developing business-to-business marketing strategies.}

We used a Dephi technique to identify the Sources of Brittleness (SBs) in the system and technologies with the highest relevance to the Malaysian setting. Using multiple linear regression, we then derived a relationship between the two aspects. The framework defines the relative resilience of the technologies according to their forecasted ability to eliminate system brittleness.

abstract = {Social media has become an important marketing media to attract and retain consumers. This article focuses on the movie industry and aims to investigate how different channels and events in social media marketing achieve box office success through different consumers’ responses. In reference to elaboration likelihood model (ELM), we propose our research model and test hypotheses using the data of 304 movies with the information of box office, attributes, and associated social media posts. The results show that: (1) official microblog activity increases the purchase intent through changing audience's attitude while third-party mention increases purchase intent through catching audience's attention and promoting positive attitude, and there is an interaction effect between official microblog and third-party media; (2) social media marketing events related to contents introduction promote purchase intent through central route while those related to surrounding information promote purchase intent through peripheral route; and (3) movie attributes interact with marketing intensity in affecting purchase intent. Under the same marketing intensity, the marketing effect of domestic sequel movies released on popular holidays is better. Our findings provide both theoretical and practical implications.}

abstract = {Data-driven innovation has received increasing attention, which explores big data technologies to gain more insights and advantages for product design. In user experience (UX) based design innovation, user-generated data and archived design documents are two valuable resources for various design activities such as identifying opportunities and generating design ideas. However, these two resources are usually isolated in different systems. Additionally, design information typically represented based on functional aspects is limited for UX-oriented design. To facilitate experience-oriented design activities, we propose a twin data-driven approach to integrate UX data and archived design documents. In particular, we aim to extract UX concepts from product reviews and design concepts from patents respectively and to discover associations between the extracted concepts. First, a UX-integrated design information representation model is proposed to associate capabilities with key elements of UX at the concept, category, and aspect levels of information. Based on this model, a twin data-driven approach is developed to bridge experience information and design information. It contains three steps: experience aspect identification using an attention-based LSTM (Long short-term memory) network, design information categorization based on topic clustering using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and LAD (Latent Dirichlet allocation) model, and experience needs and design information integration by leveraging word embedding techniques to measure concept similarity. A case study using healthcare-related experience and design information has demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach.}

We performed a longitudinal study from 2005 to 2016, building on structural holes and personal network efficiency methodology. Our results confirm the centrality of public actors in structuring and diffusing knowledge within a PPINS; the role of structural holes in controlling and filtering transferred knowledge, the main beneficiaries of which are private actors; and finally, the evolution and development of the PPINS around these central private/public actors. The network reveals that product-service innovation in the sector would be difficult to achieve without complex private/public interdependencies (knowledge, big data, logistics, digital therapies, etc.). Our paper also stresses on the need to move forward the public economic model from a public service into an innovative service to the public.}

Indeed, even when companies recognize the value of IIoT, they do not necessarily know how to grasp related opportunities and are challenged in developing a suitable business model. Accordingly, to alleviate roadblocks to capturing value from IIoT, in this paper we address the challenge of identifying suitable business models in the age of the industrial metaverse. We do so through an extensive review and classification of main IIoT business model archetypes that are successful in practice. In particular, we conduct a content analysis of IIoT projects based on over 2000 articles in industry trade magazines and newspapers. Our analysis identifies four distinct business model archetypes in the context of IIoT, viz. IIoT digical, IIoT service-centered, IIoT data-driven, and IIoT platform, and further explores the challenges that need to be addressed to ensure that companies can capture value from their IIoT initiatives. We explore appropriate contexts for these business model archetypes, and, in doing so, we provide actionable guidance for industrial (marketing) managers seeking to position their IIoT offerings and maximize their value.}

Our interest lies in using data on prepaid unitary services in a business-to-business setting to forecast client retention: whether a particular client is at risk of being lost before they cease being clients. The purpose of such a forecast is to provide the company with an opportunity to reach out to such clients as an effort to ensure their retention. We work with monthly records of client transactions: each client is represented as a series of purchases and consumptions. We vary (1) the length of the time period used to make the forecast, (2) the length of a period of inactivity after which a client is assumed to be lost, and (3) how far in advance the forecast is made. Our experimental work finds that current machine-learning techniques able to adequately predict, well in advance, which clients will be lost. This knowledge permits a company to focus marketing efforts on such clients as early as three months in advance.}

This is usually done by identifying influencers with large follower numbers, wide reach, and capacity to influence. Influencers, in response, purchase fake followers to present themselves as highly influential. Conventional wisdom assumes that fake followers typically do not affect the influencer’s account, and are therefore counterintuitive as said practice ultimately hurts influencer credibility. The current study, however, follows four extant studies to provide competing evidence revealing the number of followers to be positively associated with perceptions of influencing power, even when consumers recognize the existence of fake followers. Influencer expertise and existing popularity were also found to negate the mere number effect. Systematical support for these effects were found using both real-world data analysis and controlled experiments across different populations and contexts.

A wide range of aspects and actors derived from the digital transformation process in the automotive industry are considered. The study covers connected and autonomous driving, mobility as a service, digital information sources in car purchasing, big data, etc. The disruptive effect of the gradual introduction of electric vehicles into the market is also considered, which is boosted by environmental policies on climate change and directives for the potential use of renewable energy sources to power electric vehicles. On the other hand, the study analyses the impacts of digital transformation on the automotive industry from the point of view of different actors, ranging from automobile manufacturers, service providers, public transportation providers, and consumers to governments. The methodology has been successfully applied to a complex case study‐based empirical analysis. It presents a novel application of fsQCA to digital transformation in the automotive industry in Spain. The conclusions show that it is necessary to invest in adequate measures for adaptation to digital transformation, and manufacturers will end up having greater profits, productivity, and competitiveness. From the point of view of consumers, there will be access to more and better services and greater satisfaction with the required services.}

Initially, this study applies self-determination theory to explore how live streaming empowers consumers and affects brand interaction and decision-making, then investigates the impact of ethical issues on this process. Our findings suggest empowerment does not invariably result in high-quality relationships, particularly when consumer ethics diverge from brand behavior. Subsequently, we employ Hunt-Vitell's General Theory of Marketing Ethics for an in-depth analysis of how consumer perceived ethically mediate the empowerment-relationship quality link. Through three experiments, we confirm the impact of consumer empowerment on retention intentions and the mediating role of relationship quality, also showcasing the negative influence of consumers' ethical perceptions on the empowerment-relationship quality dynamic. This study offers fresh insights into consumer behavior within live-streaming contexts and furnishes empirical evidence for retailers to boost trust and engagement.}

abstract = {While COVID-19 has driven a significant drop in sales, the apparel industry has been undergoing a digital solution-oriented transformation. Preempting its highly profitable potential, Amazon has been expanding its fashion-driven apparel business by developing a series of advanced digital fashions (ADFs). ADFs intensified Amazon's omnichannel dependence based on seamless switching by utilizing its innovative assets. With this development, and in response to the increasing necessity for luxury brands to offer extra channels for a non-contact society, Amazon introduced Luxury Stores, a long-lasting digital platform for luxury fashion, in September 2020. While luxury brands confront “the Internet dilemma,” this conundrum can be solved by synchronizing ADFs, Luxury Stores, and on-demand manufacturing (ODM). Taking Amazon's challenge to realize its long-lasting dreams of selling luxury brands and using ODM, this paper attempts to demonstrate the significance of this approach for exploring new frontiers in business models beyond the current omnichannel approach. An empirical analysis was conducted focusing on the development trajectories of seven ADFs and 34 luxury brands that joined Luxury Stores by the end of the first half of 2021 by using a techno-economic analysis, analogical evidence approach, literature review, and subsequent SWOT analysis. It was demonstrated that by means of timely synchronization of ADFs, Luxury Stores and patented ODM, co-evolution among them can be constructed leading to the emergence of a cloud-based fashion platform that enables on-demand personalization and customization. Consequently, big data on customers, vendors, manufactures, global influencers, and social trends can be collected, which grow and expand Amazon Web Service (AWS). This in turn further accelerates co-evolution among ADFs, Luxury Brands, and ODM. Activated co-evolution further advances cloud-based fashion platforms leading to a virtuous cycle between them. Thus, dual co-evolution of the co-evolution among ADFs, luxury brands, and ODM, and cloud-based fashion platform advancement emerged. This dual-co-evolution leads to a supra-omnichannel approach that enables apparel to grow seamless switching and explore new frontiers beyond current business models. These findings give rise to suggestions for dynamic and resilient strategies toward a non-contact society.}

We aim to provide a meta-theoretical analysis of the B2B research domain by analyzing its major research communities and their paradigmatic ways of producing knowledge. The key premise is that the North American mainstream tradition (NAM) and the industrial marketing and purchasing (IMP) group-driven research approach form the dominant research cultures of B2B marketing. Paradigmatic profiling is used as a method of analysis for making the underlying assumptions and intellectual goals of the two communities transparent, enabling a rational assessment of their strengths and weaknesses. By contrasting the two paradigms, we highlight the fragmented knowledge base, identify neglected issues and unanswered questions, and suggest how to advance theory construction in the field. By analyzing the implicit assumptions and silent drivers of the NAM and IMP research communities, the study adds to our understanding of why we conduct this kind of research, how we can make better informed decisions concerning our studies, and how we might break free from the invisible paradigmatic cages to advance our discipline.}

However, the research is still quite preliminary. It has not yet gone into the details and in-depth analysis required to understand and explain why EVs are not diffusing as anticipated, despite being both financially and environmentally a better solution for human mobility. The gap in research understanding is even more comprehensive in the case of electric vehicles (EVs), which achieve the critical objective of twin transition. The present study explores this aspect in detail by conducting a qualitative study to collect data from people who already own or are planning to purchase EVs in the near future. The study's basic premise is first to evaluate the reasons and motivators that cause consumers to buy/have positive intentions to buy EVs and the role the sustainability perspective plays in their decision making. Content analysis of 32 qualitative responses indicates that consumers' adoption of EVs/intention to adopt SEVs was impacted by digital features, financial considerations, and environmental concerns. The study also revealed a certain lack of awareness, mainly driven by misinformation about the potential adverse effect of EVs on the environment. Based on these findings, the study offers concrete suggestions on how various stakeholders, including e-businesses and digital marketing companies, can play a positive role in providing relevant information and promoting the use of EVs for the greater good.}

abstract = {Over the past two decades, digitalization has revolutionized not only consumer marketing but also industrial marketing. Both industrial marketing scholars and industrial marketers seek insights to understand how our knowledge and practice of digital marketing has been structured and configured. To address this gap, we adopt the resource-based perspective as an organizing framework and systematically review 129 articles spanning two decades of research to identify different digital marketing capabilities in industrial firms. From this analysis, we identify four themes: channels, social media, digital relationships, and digital technologies. We then stress-test this knowledge with managerial practices by conducting an online survey of 169 managers, designed to establish the repertoire of current and future marketing capability needs of industrial firms. Herein, we identify two marketing capabilities gaps: the practice gap—which identifies the deficit between managers' ‘current’ practices and their ‘ideal’ digital marketing capabilities; and, the knowledge gap—which demonstrates a significant divide between the digital marketing transformations in industrial firms and the extant scholarly knowledge that underpins this. Based on these results, we build an agenda for future research on digital marketing capabilities.}

abstract = {There is growing concern amongst policy makers, managers and academic researchers over the role that social media plays in spreading misinformation, widely described as ‘Fake News’. However, research to date has mainly focussed on the implications of fake news for political communication and debate. There has been less focus on the implications of social media misinformation upon marketing and consumers. Given the key role of social media as a communication platform, there is a gap in our understanding of fake news through a consumer lens. We address this gap by conducting an interdisciplinary systematic review of the relevant literature. Through critical evaluation and synthesis of the literature, we identify five themes that explain the fake news phenomenon: the dissemination process, spreading channel features, outcomes, fabricated legitimacy and attitudes. Finally, we propose a theoretical framework that highlights themes’ relationships and research propositions to guide future research in this area.}

Our research is based on two in-depth, comparative case studies of large multinational corporations: one manufacturing company that takes the servitisation approach and the other a logistics services company taking a productisation approach. The research addresses two principal gaps in extant PSS research. First, most extant PSS research focuses predominantly on servitisation development and overlooks the productisation perspective. We address this gap by considering PSS from both a productisation and servitisation perspective. Second, extant research investigates PSS integration mainly from the ‘technical’ and ‘commercial’ perspectives. In contrast, this research adds a ‘social’ perspective by considering the business-to-authority (B2A) and business-to-public (B2P) relations. The findings also provide business practitioners with preliminary yet meaningful insights into holistic consideration of PSS ecosystem integration from ‘technical’, ‘commercial’ and ‘social’ perspectives. Moreover, we seek to push the boundaries of PSS ecosystem research and promote interdisciplinary research across fields, including business strategy, industrial marketing, social marketing, public policy and supply chain management.}

Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT’s use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.}

Digital transformation requires sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring the digital technological challenges into opportunities. Academic literature acknowledges the central role of design as a driver of innovation. Furthermore, recent research discloses the value that design, especially design thinking, can have in leading digital transformations. In this understanding, design thinking has been proven to be an approach based on dynamic capabilities. What seems to lack in the current understanding is how the dynamic capabilities of design thinking can facilitate digital transformation. Thus, the paper aims to shed light on how dynamic capabilities of design thinking foster discovering the opportunities digital technologies provide to enact the transformation. This paper investigates four different cases of consulting projects where the adoption of design thinking dynamic capabilities enhance the value of digital technologies towards a more human centric digital transformation. By being a business-to-business market, the consulting environment might inform readers how design thinking dynamic capabilities are salient for digital transformation. Examining them, the paper proposes five design thinking dynamic capabilities that managers should cultivate: extending, debating, cropping, interpreting, and recombining. Concerning academic debate, the paper enriches the understanding of digital transformation by unshadowing the value that design thinking dynamic capabilities might play in it.}

Using business research on gamification published in the last decade (2012–2022) found on Scopus and Web of Science, we conduct a performance analysis to illuminate the field's performance (publication productivity and impact) alongside its key contributors (journals, authors, and countries) as well as a science mapping using a co-citation analysis to locate knowledge foundations, and bibliographic coupling and keyword co-occurrence analysis to reveal major themes in business gamification. Our exploration has unearthed gamification's pervasive influence across business domains, from enhancing learning and fostering innovation to empowering marketing strategies and catalyzing transformation. Gamification has also made significant inroads into management practices, driving engagement, influencing behavioral outcomes, and ushering sustainability. Peering into the future, our density-centrality quadrant analysis casts light on emerging frontiers. Noteworthily, we expect the next wave of gamification to be shaped by the allure of video games and the metaverse, bespoke industry-specific designs, confluence with e-commerce trends, emphasis on sustainable development, expanded social responsibilities, innovations in virtual reality, intersections with human urbanism, and the rise of smart cities. As gamification continues to integrate and reshape myriad facets of the business world, it holds the promise of not only enriching current practices but also charting the course for the future of innovative, sustainable, and transformative business strategies.}

Analyzing Chinese agricultural job vacancy data enables us to discern precise labor market characteristics, facilitating inferences about employment trends and future skill training needs. Employing text mining and network science, we create a skill network, classifying skills into categories based on their interconnections. Our analysis reveals a certain degree of skill polarization in China's agricultural labor force. Skill combinations elucidate diverse labor market dynamics, with digital and soft skills being highly sought after by agricultural employers due to their complementarity with cognitive skills, enhancing workers' competitiveness. Furthermore, we link two skill diversity metrics from the skill network to labor market outcomes, specifically wages, discovering that wage disparities are prominent in single-skill positions, while roles requiring a range of skills command higher wages compared to specialized positions. In summary, our research provides fresh insights into labor market trends, human capital complexity, and the economic inequalities stemming from agricultural digitization and automation, especially in rural areas.}

The present study implements a different approach to reviewing by combining two bibliometric methods, multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), via Bibexcel software to have a deeper investigation of the process. Considering the 468 journal papers on e-WOM allowed us to study the intellectual streams and significant perceptions underpinning e-WOM. By dividing the study timeframe into three periods, we realized that there have always been three main concepts in this field: consumer behavior, sales, and the tourism and hotel industry. Further, by proposing a framework, we have expanded these concepts accompanied by the role of artificial intelligence and robots in the process of e-WOM. Consequently, new concepts “r-WOM”, “automated user engagement”, and “smart selling” are introduced and demonstrated as a consequence of using technology-based tools in the process of e-WOM. Finally, the future scope of this field has been designed. We contribute to the literature by offering theoretical and managerial implications.}

However, prior studies investigating the effects of SMU on organizational performance provide scattered, mixed, and even conflicting results from diverse disciplines. This study aims to map the comprehensive relationship between SMU and organizational performance by adopting meta-analysis and examining potential factors that moderate such relationships. Based on the sample size of 24,576 organizations accumulated from 65 empirical studies, this study attempts to dissect SMU into manifold practices containing social marketing, social listening & monitoring, social communication, and social networking & collaboration. Meanwhile, these SMUs have varying relationships not only with financial performance but also with innovation, social and operational performance. Further analysis results also confirm that theoretical lens, social media platforms, and industry-level factors (i.e., firm size, industry type, economic market) significantly moderate the strength of SMU–Performance relationships. These findings provide theoretical contributions, managerial implications, and future research directions on the integrated SMU–Performance relationship.}

Data collected from 405 chatbot users of selected banks were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results reveal that chatbot affordances positively influence personalization and experience. Furthermore, personalization influences switching costs and psychological ownership, whereas experience affects psychological ownership. Moreover, switching costs affect continuance intention through inattentiveness to alternatives.

SM can be mobilised to create value in: sales and marketing activities, developing new and maintaining existing relationships, developing a firm’s reputation and network identity, and being part of the product offering to the market. In addition, we also found SM to be a dynamic resource in practice – moving between and present in more than one resource category in any collaborative activity.}

While B2B firms are increasingly investing in social media, there is limited understanding about the type of content to be published and how customers may react to their posts. The authors address these research gaps by developing a conceptual framework that relates posts’ brand personality dimensions (sincerity, excitement, competence, sophistication, and ruggedness) to customer engagement. Using data from a small-sized Chilean-Swiss consultancy firm accounting for 114 weeks of LinkedIn activity, the authors specify a VAR model with exogenous variables (VARX). Focusing on the cumulative elasticities, the study uncovers the engagement mechanisms of customers. The results show that an increase in impressions (exposure) leads to an increase in likes, clicks, and shares (perceptions), an increase in clicks leads to an increase in new followers (actions), and an increase in new followers leads to an increase in impressions. Furthermore, the results indicate that an increase in posts’ excitement leads to an increase in impressions and likes, an increase in posts’ competence leads to an increase in clicks, and an increase in posts’ ruggedness leads to an increase in new followers.}

By considering the theories, contexts, characteristics, and methodologies used in LP research, this study (1) paints the most comprehensive picture of the field to date and (2) develops a future research agenda to help advance the field further. Our review reveals that existing studies mostly rely on status-based, inertia-based, or relationship-based mechanisms to theoretically explain LP-related effects, while multi-theoretical perspectives are rare. LP research focuses strongly on a few key industries, such as retail, airlines, and hotels, but lacks insights into the design and outcomes of LPs in online and B2B contexts. Furthermore, we diagnose a need for more research on the role of competition among LPs and the impact of recent technological advances on LP management.}

We outline how S-CRM is a second-order dynamic capability consistng of a set of first-order integrative dynamic capabiliies that, when properly interrelated, lead to performance outcomes. We particularly model the role of S-CRM front- and back-office technology capabilities, customer engagement initiatives, and social information processes in driving customer relationship performance. Findings show that S-CRM is different from traditional CRM in a range of ways in the front- and back-offices, and provide a framework for researcher and managers in information systems and marketing to operate at strategic and tactical levels within S-CRM, while being congisant of both.}

Investigation focused primarily on the entrepreneurial capability (ENCAP) of such firms and industrial competition (INDCOM) as predictors of the IBCO of a business. Analysis was conducted as to whether IBCO contributed to heightened market sensing capability (MKTSENSE) and indirectly reinforced competitiveness. To this end, data was sourced from 198 firms based in Nigeria, typically micro-, small- and medium-sized businesses. Statistical analysis indicated that IBCO had a stronger and direct effect on encouraging the fluency of operations at small- and medium-sized enterprises. However, IBCO in combination with a competitive advantage was insufficient to attain competitiveness, the magnitude of such an effect being indirectly anchored to the MKTSENSE of the firm. This study highlights that businesses need to invest in Internet marketing tools and employ them effectively to stay competitive over the long term.}

This paper presents two studies that contribute to the trust path of mobile advertising, which can ultimately increase customers’ purchase intention. The survey study proposes a new moderator, mobile learning by ads, which can aid in developing the trust path theory in mobile advertising. We tested a research model that includes a moderated mediation relationship using a sample of 200 respondents. Survey results reveal that mobile learning strengthens the link between trust, value, and purchasing behavior. This finding highlights the importance of incorporating mobile learning strategies to enhance customer trust and ultimately increase purchase intention in mobile advertising. In the post hoc study, this paper introduces the text analysis to explore a large dataset containing 3499 tweets contributing to mobile advertising. Text analytics results indicate that blockchain and cybersecurity are the primary topics among users who focus on the trust path in mobile advertising. Blockchain and cybersecurity are the most identified topics because cyber-attacks and privacy concerns are growing in mobile advertising systems. Moreover, the fact that users remain optimistic about the trust path is significant for its theory development.}

However, extant understandings of deepfakes’ implications in the marketplace are limited and fragmented. Against this background, we develop insights into the significance of deepfakes for firms and consumers—the threats they pose, how to mitigate those threats, and the opportunities they present. Our findings indicate that the main risks to firms include damage to image, reputation, and trustworthiness and the rapid obsolescence of existing technologies. However, consumers may also suffer blackmail, bullying, defamation, harassment, identity theft, intimidation, and revenge porn. We then accumulate and present knowledge on the strategies and mechanisms to safeguard against deepfake-based marketplace deception.

abstract = {Digital transformation (DT) has been identified as one of the major trends that is changing society and business. Firms respond strategically to the DT trend in different ways. The results of this study, based on Chinese listed companies, demonstrate that, as family firms have stronger needs for legitimacy and are sensitive about investing in uncertain projects, they are more likely than their non-family counterparts to disclose more symbolic cues about DT while investing less substantively in DT, that is, they emphasize DT in their annual reports to a greater extent while making fewer digital investments. We also investigated firm- and provincial-level contingencies. Specifically, we show that family firms located in provinces with better digital infrastructure are more likely to disclose symbolic cues about DT and invest substantively in DT. Family firms that have completed the intergenerational succession process are shown to be more likely to disclose symbolic cues about DT.}

This requires more in-depth understanding of how to manage such journeys and interactions, particularly with AI-empowered tools that enhance B2B companies' diverse and crucial marketing management operations, ranging from forecasting to managing relationships. To reach this research goal, this paper integrates the current scattered understanding of B2B customer journeys and their management into AI research and presents a two-phase empirical study. First, through an integrative literature review, this study analyzes the relevant contemporary B2B management activities for managing customer journeys and identifies four key management activities: analyze, design, engage, and guide. Second, through mapping over 150 digital tools under 16 marketing management–tool categories and identifying and analyzing AI functions within those tools, the study examines how AI supports companies in the B2B customer journey management activities. The study makes contributions to B2B digital marketing, management and sales research, as well as customer journey management. It also provides guidance for B2B marketers and AI tool technology developers on how AI-empowered tools can be applied and developed to support B2B marketing management, particularly B2B customer journeys.}

Little is known about CE strategies when it comes to family-owned businesses in emerging market context. This paper tries to synthesize the extant literature on CE to identify the state of research concerning CE practices followed in family-owned businesses from emerging markets. To achieve this objective, we first conducted a structured literature review of CE research published in last two decades in the top tier management and marketing journals. Second, drawing from the insights received from the findings of the structured review, we design a structured interview schedule to collect first-hand data from the managers working in family-owned businesses in India. This rich data is then analyzed using a qualitative data analysis package. Findings from our analysis reveal that social media platforms, continuous monitoring of the customer feedback and reviews, importance to non-financial goals, safeguarding the reputation, and maintaining the trustful relationship are critical aspects of family-owned firms’ CE strategy. Another interesting aspect about the CE strategies in family businesses vis-à-vis non-family-businesses, specifically from an emerging country context is the reliance on the third-party agencies to manage the content creation and digital marketing. Study findings not only help advance the scholarship within the twin fields of customer engagement and family business, but also provide valuable insights to the practitioners of family-owned businesses.}

Developing a content aesthetic quality scale with a sample of 1166 buyers of luxury fashion brands, we identify two routes for how social media content can augment brand loyalty and foster brand love for luxury fashion brands. We reveal that the effectiveness of social media content in generating customer brand engagement depends on its ability to be entertaining. Specifically, our findings demonstrate that entertainment affects customer engagement and mediates the relationship between content marketing (specifically, content aesthetic quality and celebrity endorsement) and customer engagement with luxury fashion brands. Customer engagement fosters brand loyalty and brand love. Managerial implications for luxury brand managers and social media marketers are discussed.}

South Korea aims to diffuse 8.3 million battery electric vehicles (BEVs) by 2040 to reduce emissions in the transportation sector. However, BEV diffusion policies have not been considered for BEVs' electricity consumption. Given that the rapid diffusion of BEVs significantly increases the electricity demand, forecasting BEVs' electricity consumption is necessary to inform electricity production plans. Furthermore, electricity is produced through various energy sources, and electricity prices and consumption are affected; therefore, forecasts that reflect the overall energy market are needed. This study presents a forecasting model for BEV demand and energy consumption by combining it with a macroeconometric model that reflects the overall energy market and socioeconomic impact using an innovation diffusion model. Incorporating electricity prices and renewable energy consumption derived from the macroeconometric model, annual BEV demand and electricity consumption are predicted. Moreover, BEV demand is more diffused and slower when forecasted using the Generalized Bass model with electricity prices and renewable energy consumption, compared to forecast without these factors, and the predictive power of BEVs is superior to that forecasted using the Bass Model alone.}

abstract = {Online-to-offline (O2O) omnichannel retail has grown very fast, but in the case of food, differences between product illustrations posted online and the actual goods that consumers receive have been a persistent problem. Hence, this pioneering study proposes a two-stage AI deep-learning method for mitigation of the quality risk posed to O2O omnichannel operations by O2O food dissimilarity, and investigates what information should be disclosed online to minimize the gap between O2O consumer expectations and perceptions, based on information theory and expectation-confirmation theory. Its empirical results reveal, first, that the proposed method can successfully assess the similarity between offline versions of products and the online images utilized for marketing them; and second, that restaurants can use food-similarity records to determine which online food-marketing images are most likely to achieve positive expectation confirmation. Lastly, it recommends that online food platforms include multiple, varied images of most heterogeneous foods, as a further means of avoiding O2O dissimilarity problems.}

Indeed, the adoption of new innovative technology in the banking & finance sector lags behind other business sectors. Many of the valuable banking & finance-related technologies have not been adopted in relation to the strategic implications of decisions in domains such as the development of service innovation and personalization, value co-creation, and marketing strategies. In particular, there is a paucity of research in using gamification to explore ways of customising banking & finance fintech offerings, improving customers’ experience, and developing efficient banking & finance marketing tactics. Drawing on the UTAUT2 and Otcalysis gamification framework, this study develops a research model investigating what configurations of motivations, expectations and conditions can shape consumers’ behavioral intention to adopt a gamified mobile wallet system. Findings suggest that combining effort expectancy, facilitating conditions and perceived value leads to higher intention to use gamified mobile wallet. Accordingly, firms need to consider the three core conditions when design relevant gamifications.}

abstract = {Formulating strategies to maintain policyholders is one of the main challenges for most insurance companies in Iran. The purpose of this article is to help marketing strategists of insurance companies predict insurees' churn and develop insurees retention strategies. Since the cost of maintaining an insurance policyholder is approximately one-eighth of the cost of attracting new ones, predicting their churn can help insurance companies adopt proper strategies in advance, which will definitely lead to saving marketing costs and maintaining the insurer's portfolio. Accordingly, the main question of this research is how to classify organizational insurees with the help of the clustering technique. This research is conducted in both qualitative and quantitative phases. In the qualitative phase, by conducting a semi-structured interview (interview protocol) with 15 experts in the insurance industry, the influential factors on policyholders' churn are identified. Then, based on the factors identified in the research literature and comparing them with the interview results, eight main factors are finalized. In the quantitative phase, in order to cluster the organizational insurees, 120 samples from the Iran Insurance Company are selected, and k-means is applied for clustering. Organizational insurees are divided into two groups according to the desired indicators. Using the results of clustering, insurees are divided into four groups, and effective marketing strategies are developed for each group. According to the results, the variable “health care insurance price” has the most effective role in separating the clusters at an error level of <0.01, and on the contrary, the variable “liability insurance amount” has the least important role at an error level of <0.978.}

Specifically, we argue for the success of a personalization involving the integration of two stages: the self-disclosure stage and the personalization stage. Using a conceptual framework grounded in the foot-in-the-door effect, we argue that compliance with commitment to self-disclosure as the initial small request induces greater compliance with the later target request. The results of a large-scale two-stage field experiment based on a combined propensity score matching and difference-in-difference model show positive causal effects of the act of self-disclosure and the positive effect of the intensity of self-disclosure on purchase responses to personalized promotions. The results also indicate that a combination of privacy assurance and personalization declaration drives customers’ act of self-disclosure and increases the intensity of self-disclosure. Findings empower managers to capitalize on new opportunities in personalization.}

Traditionally, customer churn prediction was dependent on binary classifiers, which are often optimized for accuracy-based performance measures. However, there is a growing consensus that this approach may not always fulfill the critical business objective of profit maximization, as it overlooks the costs of misclassification and the benefits of accurate classification. This study adopts extreme gradient boosting trees to predict profit-driven customer churn. The class weights and other hyperparameters of these trees are optimized using Bayesian methods based on the profit maximization criterion. Empirical analyses are conducted using real datasets obtained from service providers in multiple markets. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model yields significantly higher profits than the benchmark models. Bayesian optimization and adjustment of class weights contributed to enhanced model profitability. Furthermore, when optimizing multiple hyperparameters, the computational cost of model optimization is significantly reduced compared with an exhaustive grid search. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model through a sensitivity analysis employing Bayesian optimization. Using the proposed model, marketing managers can design targeted marketing plans to retain customer groups with a higher likelihood of churning.}

The successful application of X as a Service heavily depends on end-users’ acceptance. This study explored the motivation factors for X as a Service based on the evidence from adopting Farming as a Service in Agriculture 4.0 among farmers in Northeastern China. We provided a theoretical framework for Farming as a Service adoption behavior, covering factors including personalization, perceived enjoyment, functionality, perceived risk, financial consequences, and perceived network externality. The effectiveness of the research model was assessed and validated through a two-stage procedural approach, utilizing partial least squares structural equation modeling. Results revealed that our proposed acceptance model for Farming as a Service exhibited a good model fit, accounting for 84.4 % of the variance in adoption intentions. Research findings highlighted that perceived network externality and functionality were the most influential factors in determining users’ adoption intentions for Farming as a Service. Conversely, perceived risk emerged as a significant negative factor influencing adoption. Furthermore, financial consequences, perceived enjoyment, and personalization also played crucial roles as determinants of user adoption. These findings offered valuable insights for service providers to improve their products, services, and marketing strategies.}

There is little research on social media marketing strategies by B2B organizations. To fill this gap, this study uses a sample of 57 B2B ICOs completed by December 2019 and qualitative comparative analysis to examine how the combined effect of four conditions related to B2B ICOs (percentage of tokens distributed, amount of funding raised, minimum investment required, and ICO price) and two conditions related to the promoter’s country (institutional efficiency and tax haven status) lead to a low Alexa Rank. While the percentage of tokens distributed and the amount of funds raised play a key role in achieving a low Alexa Rank, the minimum investment required seems to play a secondary role. Moreover, the importance of the characteristics of the B2B ICO promoter’s country depends on both the presence and the value of the conditions related to financial characteristics.}

The objective of this study is to investigate the differential effects of product-related and product-unrelated service transitions on financial performance and the moderating roles of informational and social TMT faultlines. Analyses of secondary data from 293 manufacturing firms in China between 2003 and 2018 indicate that although product-related service transition increases financial performance (as measured by Tobin's Q), product-unrelated service transition decreases it. Informational faultlines increase these performance implications by enhancing the positive effect of product-related service transition but attenuating the negative effect of product-unrelated service transition. In contrast, social faultlines decrease these performance implications by attenuating the positive effect of product-related service transition but enhancing the negative effects of product-unrelated service transition. These findings contribute to the marketing strategy literature by providing new insights into the differential effects of TMT faultlines on service transition.}

Drawing from institutional perspectives, our case study, based on 44 interviews and field observation, seeks to analyze how institutional forces interact with the Wi-Fi adoption process at three small organizations with different innovation statuses. Results reveal the significance of institutional forces in shaping small organizations' technology adoption process. At the knowledge stage, institutional forces stem from the champion's advocacy and institutional pressures. At the persuasion and implementation stages, they are embedded in organizations' actions in following the institutional trend and complying with institutional norms. At the confirmation stage, they can be observed in organizations' shaping institutional changes or leapfrogging institutional trends. These insights challenge and extend the traditional linear perspective of innovation diffusion and contribute to the literature on technology adoption, digital transformation, innovation leapfrogging, institutional theory, and SMEs. Managerially, we propose three strategic responses (i.e., trend reformulation, service differentiation, complete transformation) that urge SMEs to utilize leapfrogging effects of technologies to renovate their innovation status.}

abstract = {Many sellers provide incentives for online product reviews to influence consumer perceptions and purchase decisions. Although relevant laws require disclosure of such incentives, compliance has been low as sellers fear that it may dampen consumer trust and product sales. We analyze product reviews on Amazon.com and find that reviews with mandatory disclosures by platform are associated with lower product ratings thus have a restraining effect on reviewers, while voluntary disclosures by reviewers lead to higher ratings, thus a potential upward bias due to moral licensing. Regression analyses based on propensity score matching show that in comparison with voluntary disclosures, mandatory disclosures have a positive effect on review helpfulness and sales, thus benefitting both sellers and consumers. These findings provide novel insight into the disclosure of incentives for online product reviews and have broad implications for e-marketing, consumer welfare, and public policy in the platform economy.}

This paper presents a review aimed at mapping research on social media engagement in the food supply chain. The contribution of this review is threefold. First, we apply a bibliometric analysis to identify four overarching thematic clusters in the literature inspired by findings from semi-structured interviews. Second, integrative frameworks for examining patterns and trends within the research topic are developed, enabling the identification of new research questions. Third, in contrast to traditional literature reviews, we incorporate practical needs and insights into our future research projections.}

Integrating the literature on digital transformation and MSPs, we delineate firms' MSP efforts along with three dimensions (digital operation efforts, technology sharing efforts, and flat management efforts) and posit that each addresses specific challenges associated with the environmental, social, and governance components of ESG performance. Using a sample of 213 publicly listed Chinese firms, encompassing 1527 firm-year observations, we measure the variation in the three dimensions of MSP efforts through a deep neural network-based latent Dirichlet allocation topic model to analyze their annual reports. We find that digital operation efforts enhance environmental, social, and governance performance; technology sharing efforts primarily improve environmental and social performance; and flat management efforts boost only governance performance. In addition, these effects are more pronounced for large firms than for small firms. Two robustness checks, employing patent applications and granted patents as alternative indicators of firms' MSP efforts, further corroborate these findings. This research augments both the MSP and ESG literature, offering actionable insights for firms, governments, and non-governmental organizations.}

Among them, phygital arises as a promising topic defined as the use of technology to bridge the digital with the physical world with the purpose of providing a unique interactive experience for the user. Due the actuality of the issue, the literature on phygital is fragmented and far from a full understanding of its meaning and implications. Moving from these premises, our research attempts to analyse the current state of the debate about the promising role of phygital environment to identify how digital technologies are transforming physical world. At this aim, a critical literature review is performed to identify how the customer experience is undergoing a renaissance due to the Covid-19 pandemic that forced organisations to improve the customer experiences. Our findings allow to identify main trends in the academic debate as grouped into five main clusters, related to the adoption of phygital technologies for: i) Marketing and Consumers' Behaviour; ii) Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Urban Development; iii) Education and Learning; iv) Social issues and Politics; v) Technical and Legal Issues. These areas are linked together showing how the different phygital environments lead to the provisions of novel and immersive experience for customers involved into strategic industries such as retail, tourism and education. Directions for future research and management implications are finally provided.}

However, although its generic pattern makes it a versatile tool for inventing and discovering the next generation of engineering systems, the scope of its practical use in product innovation has yet to be critically explored. This includes the applicability of its trends and sub-trends, efficacy and benefits in product development, and challenges and limitations. Therefore, this review uses reliable and noteworthy studies to overview the use of TESE in science and explore the benefits and challenges associated with its practical use. TESE-based studies have been conducted to prove its usability in technological development and innovation. We recommend that TESE should be integrated with various computer-aided aspects, such as scientific information, patents, social networking, disruptive technologies, manufacturing, and robotics, to address existing limitations. In addition, this review validates that these five aspects have yet to be demonstrated cohesively. This review provides TESE practitioners with insights into the application of the trends and sub-trends of the TESE toolkit.}

This new generation of brand development has brought an era of hyper-customized experiences to benefit brand performance. With the Branding 4.0 literature still in its infancy, questions remain regarding how brands can maintain their identity while delivering a hyper-personalized customer experience. This study draws on mass customization, artificial intelligence, and supply chain management literature to investigate how three core organizational capabilities and resources—machine learning, modularity, and supply chain integration—helpful in achieving production flexibility could jointly enable companies to transition to and maintain a Branding 4.0 philosophy through more efficient personalization of their product offerings. This paper reports findings from 15 in-depth interviews with top executives from brands, including some Fortune Global 500 companies, in China's garment and footwear industries to provide insights into Branding 4.0 and the possible contribution of machine learning, modularity application, and supply chain integration. Our findings inform a two-tier response strategy and a three-dimensional analytical framework which provide a theoretical basis for operationalizing Branding 4.0 and exploring, through a resource orchestration lens, how brands can respond to the related adoption challenges. Specifically, our findings show how machine learning's data analysis, knowledge conversion, and transmission capabilities could benefit both modular management and supply chain tasks to optimize product co-design processes and timely responses to customers' changing demands.}

In addition, using co-authorship, co-citation, and bibliographic coupling analyses, we investigate the knowledge structures prevailing among the sources citing JBR, its contributing authors, and their affiliations. Our findings indicate that the most prolific authors have US affiliations and that JBR has stronger ties with other leading marketing and management journals, such as the Journal of Marketing, the Journal of Consumer Research, the Journal of Marketing Research, Strategic Management Journal, and Industrial Marketing Management. Bibliographic coupling groups the JBR SI publications into seven clusters identified as consumer behavior of emerging technologies, organizational resources and networks, dynamics of consumer power in marketing, measurement issues, globalization of marketing, future-oriented strategies and tools, and market relationships. Finally, a comparison of JBR SIs with RIs highlights scholarship from more countries with a focus on evolving and current topics.}

As smartphones are short life cycle products replaced at an increasing rate, refurbishing is one of the end-of-life strategies to recover value from used smartphones. Chief among the factors given for refurbishing success is consumers' perception of the aspects of the purchase toward these products. This research investigates the significant factors in consumer perceived value about purchasing refurbished smartphones. Online product reviews are recognized as a promising data source to evaluate consumers' post-purchase behaviour in the actual market. Accordingly, a customer satisfaction model of online refurbished smartphone reviews from e-commerce websites is presented to explore customer satisfaction dimensions (CSDs) toward refurbished smartphones. The results indicate that product characteristics, including function, which is related to satisfactory working, appearance, which is the same as no scratches on body and screen, and battery health, are the most worrying feature of refurbished smartphones that consumers have mentioned. Besides, we find that the similarity of these products to brand new ones and their lower prices are the main reason and motivation for purchasing. The results also show that the perceived value of refurbished smartphones is found as a two-dimensional structure based on perceived incentive and quality and perceived benefit and risk. Eventually, some solutions propose to improve customer perceptions and reduce the misconception of refurbishment concept, which can be used by refurbishers and marketing managers for proper product development and marketing strategies.}

Virtual environments and immersive games (such as, Second Life, Fortnite, Roblox and VRChat) have been described as antecedents of the metaverse and offer some insight to the potential socio-economic impact of a fully functional persistent cross platform metaverse. Separating the hype and “meta…” rebranding from current reality is difficult, as “big tech” paints a picture of the transformative nature of the metaverse and how it will positively impact people in their work, leisure, and social interaction. The potential impact on the way we conduct business, interact with brands and others, and develop shared experiences is likely to be transformational as the distinct lines between physical and digital are likely to be somewhat blurred from current perceptions. However, although the technology and infrastructure does not yet exist to allow the development of new immersive virtual worlds at scale - one that our avatars could transcend across platforms, researchers are increasingly examining the transformative impact of the metaverse. Impacted sectors include marketing, education, healthcare as well as societal effects relating to social interaction factors from widespread adoption, and issues relating to trust, privacy, bias, disinformation, application of law as well as psychological aspects linked to addiction and impact on vulnerable people. This study examines these topics in detail by combining the informed narrative and multi-perspective approach from experts with varied disciplinary backgrounds on many aspects of the metaverse and its transformational impact.

Grounded in the Technological-Organizational-Environmental (TOE) framework, we employed a qualitative, multiple case study approach, investigating three auditing firms of varying sizes through interviews and secondary document reviews. Our findings reveal six factors influencing AI adoption, including technology affordances and constraints, the firm's innovation management approaches and AI readiness, the competition environment, and the regulatory environment. Noteworthily, these factors vary significantly among the three firms. Larger firms, often operating in an environment with high AI penetration, primarily perceive the operating affordance of AI rather than marketing affordance. This means their AI adoption encompasses greater scale and depth than smaller firms. However, this expansive adoption exposes them to a widening gap in regulatory frameworks, hindering AI adoption. Moreover, smaller firms are characterized by weaker AI readiness, positioning them disadvantageously to mitigate the constraints imposed by AI. This study contributes to existing literature by offering a more holistic perspective on AI adoption in professional services.}

We specify a VAR model with exogenous variables (VARX) using 106 weeks of data from a new, steadily growing B2B firm. We focus on the cumulative effects (i.e., short- and long-term effects) of the types of posts, website visits, new followers, and a composite of engagement behaviors over time and compute elasticities with impulse response functions (IRFs). Our findings indicate that followers and website visits positively affect the amount of sales revenue, and sales posts and website visits drive the number of followers. In addition, we find that social posts, new followers, and sales revenue positively influence engagement. These findings demonstrate the utility of LinkedIn at the firm level, preventing top management from perceiving social media as an ornamental accessory, and provide guidance for B2B marketers about what content to post on LinkedIn.}

Several discussions on ethical leadership in the digital economy have provided some insights into addressing increased complexity in a society where markets are connected (physically) yet disconnected (proximity) and this has led marketing practices going astray. Our paper proposes the relevance of ethical leadership and its role in the application of technological innovation by arguing that technological innovation has a positive impact on firm performance and that ethical leadership plays a critical role in moderating this effect.

abstract = {SME manufacturers of electrical and electronic equipment seem to have high e-waste levels, which is inhibiting SMEs manufacturers in becoming more sustainable. On the other hand, consumers play a major role in enabling the SMEs manufacturers to achieve their sustainability targets as they are responsible for returning their e-waste back to SMEs. Based on the concepts of social marketing theory, this paper aims to examine the type of information that influences consumers’ intention to immediately return their e-waste back to SME manufacturers. A conceptual framework is developed and tested through a survey questionnaire to 394 Malaysian consumers. The relationship of the proposed types of information and information presentation towards consumers’ immediate return attitude, as well as environmental motivation and environmental knowledge as the moderators in consumers’ segmentation are tested. The findings suggest that specific type of return information and message framing have a positive effect on Immediate Return Intention.}

While the model balances motivation with the effects, continuous rewarding may be necessary to motivate users to continue their interaction until the effects are achieved. Ease of use is also important for designing the interactions. Lastly, the series of interactive activities should be fun. This study summarizes three types of business purposes: donation-oriented, challenge-oriented, and amusement-oriented. The proposed model can be applied to each type of design, but different implementation details serve various effects, such as charity, engagement, and marketing. This study uses real cases to exemplify and explain the model, thus providing a holistic view for experiential interaction design. Future research can probe more in-depth into each component of the model.}

Such confliction is greatly intensified for firms whose core business and/or marketing communications contradict the general social and environmental interests of the society. Considering theories and concepts borrowed from consumer behavior that appear to have been influential in explaining pertinent B2B buyer purchasing decisions, this paper empirically investigates the contingency conditions underpinning CSR and its communication effect on organizational customer outcomes. Our results, based on panel data from Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini (KLD) and Compustat database, suggest that on average B2B firms' CSR communications significantly enhance their firm value; however, this value enhancing effect is attenuated when controversies weigh in on firms' industry and/or corporate reputations. Specifically, CSR communications have significantly positive impact on firms in regular settings, but the impact becomes negligible or even negative for firms operating in controversial industries or firms face controversial advertising problems. Theoretical and managerial implications of the research are provided.}

Based on scarce literature on the role of AI in the pharmaceutical industry, we considered which business processes are subject to transform within it and how they do so. We determine that small pharma companies significantly change research and development, master data management, analysis and reporting, and human resource business processes under the influence of AI. Large pharma companies use AI to transform production, sales, marketing, and analysis business processes. In turn, medium-sized companies are in the middle and individually transform their business processes depending on their specialization.}

Significant tensions tend to arise across this gap. However, the data-driven experimentation, and the organizational capabilities developed within the firm, increase the ability of the company to foster technological forecasting and business model innovation. It is argued within this paper, that growth hacking actually mitigates these tensions. This paper is a critical review complemented with insights from practitioners and an illustrative case, the purpose of which is to: a) shed light on what growth hacking is; b) give practical tips on how to implement growth hacking. In achieving the first goal, the paper unravels the following myths. First, growth hacking is not a framework for platforms and high-tech companies only. Second, it is not only a marketing strategy and third, that growth hacking is a predefined process. These issues are traced back to two flawed assumptions underlying growth hacking; namely that (a) it is a framework designed for start-ups only and (b) that a “one size fits all” approach to growth hacking is appropriate. By unravelling those issues and combining these observations we shall provide ground for a fundamentally different approach to growth hacking, designed for business model scalability, enabled for adaptability in a changing business environment and focused throughout on the effective management of a firm's resources and capabilities. These insights shall guide scholars towards a better understanding of the phenomenon and of the two waves that characterize its evolution, providing also promising future research avenues. Moreover, the implications drawn from the discussion shall help managers in guiding their journey from strategy definition to strategy implementation.}

The principal contribution of this study is that the model links a customer analytics perspective to a resource-based view (RBV)-capability of the retailers by proposing six customer analytics capability dimensions and twelve sub-dimensions in the spectrum of market orientation and technology orientation. The customer analytics capability dimensions depict three crucial themes of marketing, such as value creation (offering capability and personalization capability), value delivery (distribution capability and communication capability), and value management (data management capability and data protection capability). By incorporating this capability dimensions, practitioners will likely be able to engage customers and enhance customer equity.}

However, the extent to which transport service providers consider strategically relevant trends remains unclear. This study adopts the novel scope of door-to-door air travel in applying multi-labeled text classification models to 52 corporate reports from a sample of transport service providers. Trends identified from a literature review are used to develop seven classes. Two prototype models are developed: a dictionary-based classifier, and a supervised learning model using the multinomial naive Bayes and linear support vector machine classifiers. The latter yields the best model output. The results reveal that providers consider environmentally-friendly air transport and related products to be highly relevant, while disruption management, leveraging passengers data and improving airport feeder traffic through novel mobility concepts are considered to be of medium relevance. These models enable cheaper and quicker analysis of companies textual data. This innovative approach is also applicable to other research questions, such as market studies and finance-related projects.}

Digitalization is an important path for Chinese enterprises to realize transformation and upgrading, mainly through digital acceleration and reconstruction learning mechanisms, to drive the double leap in strategic change and tourism industry model innovation. In the context of a mismatch between digital technology and managerial skills, this study provides a theoretical model for firms to implement a leap-forward strategic change in intelligent tourism. It not only supports strategic change theory and organizational learning but also provides management illumination for digital rural construction, national tourism intelligence policy development, and enterprise intelligent tourism reform practice.}

In this paper, we develop a new metric based on the diffusion modeling framework that can help in assessing the prediction accuracy of T*. This metric is built on the premise that observed sales growth is affected both by the force that systematically varies with time and by the non-systematic random forces. We show that the two forces must be carefully combined to assess if a predicted T* is accurate enough. In addition, we empirically prove the efficacy of the proposed metric.}

We used the Dual Factor Model framework to explore the causal relationships between exchange benefits (including perceived value and perceived enjoyment) and exchange costs (including security concerns and privacy) with related factors (consumer attitudes and perceived risks) on the continuance intention to use mobile wallet apps. Based on our empirical study in Japan, we found that perceived value and enjoyment affect a consumer's continuance intention through consumer attitudes. Perceived enjoyment has a direct effect on consumer's continuance intention. Privacy and security concerns affect consumer's continuance intention through perceived risk, while privacy concerns also affects consumer attitudes. We found that perceived risk mediates the path from security concerns to continuance intention while consumer attitudes mediates the path from perceived enjoyment to continuance intention.}

To address this concern, this study leverages Bayesian theory and develops an uncertainty-aware online physician recommender system, including a Bayesian deep collaborative filtering (BDCF) model and a novel uncertainty-aware ranking algorithm. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the superiority of BDCF and the ranking algorithm.}

abstract = {The digital global value chains (DGVCs) embody the two major characteristics of the current era: globalization and digitalization. The DGVCs has a major impact on global economic development, but few studies have explored its impact on the energy system. We divide digital global value chain participation (DGVCP) into forward digital global value chain participation (FDGVCP) and backward digital global value chain participation (BDGVCP) and analyze their effect on energy resilience by employing panel data from 49 countries from 2007 to 2019. Our benchmark regression results provide empirical evidence of the negative effects of DGVCP, showing that FDGVCP and BDGVCP reduce energy resilience. Moreover, the negative impact of FDGVCP and BDGVCP is stronger in a transparent institutional environment. The results remain robust after causal identification. The mechanism analysis results show that FDGVCP and BDGVCP influence energy resilience through the scale channel, structure channel, and technology channel. Our research reveals that the DGVCs have a negative impact on energy resilience, contrasting with the conclusions of previous mainstream studies. Our findings underscore some important implications for avoiding the negative effects of DGVCs and enhancing energy resilience.}

Currently, this topic has evolved beyond conceptualization, focusing more on challenges, capabilities, and benefits. This research aims to identify dynamic capabilities within the context of Industry 4.0. Employing literature review and content analysis, we utilized grounded theory to identify capabilities. Validation was achieved through feedback from 11 scholars using questionnaires and the Delphi method. The analysis confirmed the presence of 26 dynamic capabilities essential for Industry 4.0. Subsequently, the Dynamic Capabilities theory was applied to categorize these capabilities into ‘sensing,’ ‘seizing,’ and ‘reconfiguration.’ As a result, this study establishes a roadmap model that prioritizes capabilities for Industry 4.0 integration across these categories. It organizes capabilities based on priority for implementation and within each category, highlighting the most crucial ones determined by scholars' scores. This model provides a comprehensive understanding of the path towards integration in Industry 4.0.}

These advancements aim to mitigate challenges associated with the management of chronic and multimorbid conditions which form the bulk of healthcare expenditure. Rampant fragmentation in service provisioning and technological innovation result in inefficent and increasingly burdened healthcare systems. Addressing fragmentation, IC models show promise and stand to benefit greatly from emerging digital health platform solutions. However, these interventions are relatively nascent and lack comprehensive analysis. Therefore, this study explores these emerging solutions with an integrative literature review and a qualitative analysis, identifying 26 comprehensive platform solutions that enable coordination in chronic care ecosystems. The findings offer a detailed overview and an integrative synthesis that conceptualizes socio-technical solution architectures, integrating the elements of people, process, and technology within a multi-level IC framework. This sheds light on the complex orchestration needed for managing cross-provider solutions for chronic care, and it helps researchers and decision makers better understand the complexity and challenges of healthcare transformation. Development barriers and gaps for further research are also explored.}

Recognizing the gap in clear guidelines for leveraging UD in managerial decision-making, we develop a systematic three-step approach: (1) problem identification, (2) solutions development, and (3) problem resolution. Building on organizational learning theory, we propose a solutions development framework with four conceptually distinct uses of UD based on two dimensions: organizational learning goals (exploration and exploitation) and environmental scanning scope (internal and external data sources). Finally, we discuss implications for practitioners and outline key focus areas for future research directions.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing every facet of the business landscape. Early adopter firms have implemented AI for various reasons, but the number one benefit realized is increased innovation (Jyoti & Riley, 2022). Early adopters of AI for new product development (NPD) not only demonstrate that AI finds many applications in NPD, but also offers substantial payoffs. This AI revolution is coming fast, estimated to have a 13–15 year window of adoption, peaking before the end of this decade. This article focuses on AI applications in three target areas in the new product process, where the need for better solutions is high, and the applications for AI show significant benefits. They are: 1) idea generation and concept creation and testing; 2) building a robust business case leading to better “go-to-development” investment decisions; and 3) the design, engineering, development, and testing of the product. AI applications in each of these three target areas are described briefly, along with some in-depth case illustrations of AI at work in NPD, and the benefits achieved by leading firms. These benefits include a remarkable reduction in development and testing times; optimally designed products; better and more appealing new product ideas and concepts; and more effective and productive voice-of-customer studies. Despite the reported benefits of AI in NPD, the adoption rate is quite low, about 13% across firms globally (McKinsey, 2023); thus, AI for NPD was in the “early adopter” stage of the Rogers diffusion of innovation curve by early 2023. Impediments to adoption are outlined, based on numerous studies: the lack of a strong business case; high perceived costs of adoption; the lack of corporate readiness and the right mindset; and risks and ethical issues. High uncertainties remain regarding the adoption of AI in NPD, and many unknowns still exist; thus, numerous opportunities for academic research are identified in the form of research questions begging to be answered. The article ends with a call to action, aimed at both practitioners and academics: AI is the most significant innovation in our lifetime! It's time we all got on board.}

The usefulness of sales configurators can be investigated from both the sellers' and buyers' perspectives. In this research, we focus on the latter, and we specifically investigate the antecedents of customers' acceptance of sales configurators in a supply chain. In our analysis, we concentrate on system-level antecedents, which have been neglected by the existing literature. Our research yields better knowledge of how digital sales technologies can be used by customers for improved effectiveness and perceived value. The results demonstrate that ease of use and system adaptability contribute strongly to the perceived effectiveness, and eventually to the perceived usefulness, of sales configurators. Yet, surprisingly, perceived enjoyment is identified as having the most significant effect on perceived usefulness.}

Healthcare wearable devices appear as a salient tool to connect healthcare providers and patients and thus become an essential part of the omnichannel environment. Along with this trend, the ethical concerns while using these devices have increasingly intensified and are significant barriers to market expansion. Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies discussing the role of wearables in omnichannel hospital supply chain management and examining the influence of those above concerns on healthcare wearables adoption.

Empirically, interviews with 49 experienced managers were conducted in the service network to understand their strategic pathways. Their responses reveal that MROs can resist servitization by strengthening their relationships with airlines or developing service-led advanced services. Alternatively, MROs can support OEMs' servitization by becoming subcontractors or licensed resource integrators. This study shows that servitization depends on the orchestration of service network actors with differing interests, making it contingent and multilateral.}

However, few studies are available on the effects of customer-based driving forces on CE in a defined brand experience context. Given the multidimensional nature of CE, the interrelationships among CE dimensions and various dimensional effects on the customer–brand relationship, represented by brand intimacy, have not been thoroughly explored. To address these research gaps, this study explores three customer- and context-based forces that drive CE in social media contexts from a consumer’s perspective. CE is operationalized as a second-order construct consisting of three dimensions (i.e., consumption, contribution, and creation) to reflect its multifaceted nature. An online survey was used to collect data. The results suggest that customer-based forces, advice seeking, and self-image expression exert positive influences on behavioral CE dimensions. The effect of a context-based factor, that is, fashion involvement, is salient only when gender difference is integrated. Moreover, the three facets of behavioral CE affect brand intimacy to different extents. Brand intimacy is the most affected by creation followed by consumption. The research findings contribute to the literature on CE and brand intimacy and also offer practical insights on marketing communications and segmentation.}

Consumer preferences should be modeled with consideration of price effects. Businesses need to consider for efficient prediction of an individual's purchase behaviour. Personalized recommendation systems have been studied with machine learning algorithms. However, the price-aware personalized recommendation has received little attention. In this paper, we attempt to capture insightful economic results considered in the marketing and economics disciplines by employing modern machine learning architecture for predicting customer choice in a large-scale supermarket context. We extract personalized price sensitivities and examine their importance in consumer behaviour. The employed data collected from a supermarket chain in Germany consists of implicit feedback based on customer-product interactions and the price of every interaction. We propose a two-pathway matrix factorization (2way-MF) model that is price-aware and tries to memorize customer-product interaction's implicit feedback. The proposed models achieve better model performance than standard Matrix Factorization models widely used in the industry. The approach was re-validated with data from supermarket chain in Taiwan. Other industries can adopt the proposed framework of modeling customer's preferences based on price sensitivity. We suggest that further research and analyses could help understand the cross-price elasticities.}

Furthermore, given the lack of academic studies reflecting on the influence of more recent technologies based on artificial intelligence on the consumer journey, this study aims to fill this gap in an attempt to mold further theory development around the consumer journey concept. 74 relevant papers were retrieved mainly from a detailed search on SCOPUS, as well as a backward and forward citation analysis. A thematic analysis resulted in the identification of three literature streams that contribute to the consumer journey literature.

abstract = {With plant-based meat increasing in popularity, this study intends to analyze the challenges of popularizing plant-based meat alternatives (PBMAs) and investigate the incentives to enhance future consumption. We investigate a PBMAs producer's distribution channel selection strategies of direct-sell-to-consumer (DSTC) and indirect-sell-to-consumer (Non-DSTC), as well as the decisions for wholesale price, product eco-friendly level and research and development (R&D) investment on sustainable food products. We first examine global meat consumption trends and the emergence of PBMAs and consumer perceptions. We incorporate game-theoretic models with consumer environmental consciousness (CEC) and producer's investment decisions in a multi-channel food supply chain. Social welfare has been used to explore the effects of CEC and the competition of distribution channels on the food supply chain. Our results show that stakeholders in different channels could adopt a Co-opetition strategy to make the pie bigger. Numerical analysis shows that members of the food supply chain benefit from a higher CEC in both channel settings. This study provides insights for managerial decisions on investment in technological innovation in the food industry in terms of social, environmental and technological aspects.}

However, as more industrial firms leverage AI to address sustainable development goals, it becomes even more critical for them to account for these interdependencies and trade-offs among the SDGs. Relatively few existing studies guide industrial marketers in accounting for these interdependencies when deploying AI-enabled solutions. Herein, guided by complex adaptive systems theory and principles of systems engineering, the authors introduce a responsible AI deployment model that articulates key steps in the development and deployment of AI solutions to advance sustainable development firms.}

Drawing on systems theory, this study proposes the synergy of these three key drivers in steering digital transformation. Recent data from 206 Dutch firms support the existence of synergy, showing that digital proactiveness, change commitment, and organizational flexibility contribute jointly to digital transformation. Our analysis reveals that the effect of organizational flexibility on digital transformation is highest when digital proactiveness and change commitment are both at a high level.

The purpose of the paper is to explain the pattern of spread of the sharing economy business model. Findings point out a seamless, unobtrusive pattern echoing characteristics of the sharing economy business model across distant sectors to avoid competition while reproducing activities in ever-new resource settings. The paper continues the exploration of the sharing economy related to industrial marketing through moving from the individual platforms to the way they lead to new ones while acknowledging how the innovative model for new platforms is highly based on mandates created through acknowledging oneself as a role model successor. Such a spread mechanism redefines innovation newness, adaptation and diffusion, and raises new insights to understand how current business landscapes would be under the possible transition into a new logic of operations.}

Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) is used to examine the data and proposed hypothesis. This study finds that AI positively affects consumer experience and consumer engagement on social media. Similarly, a positive relationship exists between social media engagement and consumer experience, leading to a more satisfied consumer and amplified purchase intentions. Additionally, affective attachment moderates the relationship between consumer satisfaction and purchase intention. The results reveal that AI can be used on social media to improve consumer experience and increase customer satisfaction levels and purchase intention.

The extant literature observes that contemporary AI applications have augmented HR functionalities. AI-Augmented HRM HRM(AI) has assumed strategic importance for achieving HRM domain-level outcomes and organisational outcomes for a sustainable competitive advantage. Moreover, there is increasing evidence of literature reviews pertaining to the use of AI applications in different management disciplines (i.e., marketing, supply chain, accounting, hospitality, and education). There is a considerable gap in existing studies regarding a focused, systematic literature review on HRM(AI), specifically for a multilevel framework that can offer research scholars a platform to conduct potential future research. To address this gap, the authors present a systematic literature review (SLR) of 56 articles published in 35 peer-reviewed academic journals from October 1990 to December 2021. The purpose is to analyse the context (i.e., chronological distribution, geographic spread, sector-wise distribution, theories, and methods used) and the theoretical content (key themes) of HRM(AI) research and identify gaps to present a robust multilevel framework for future research. Based upon this SLR, the authors identify noticeable research gaps, mainly stemming from - unequal distribution of previous HRM(AI) research in terms of the smaller number of sector/country-specific studies, absence of sound theoretical base/frameworks, more research on routine HR functions(i.e. recruitment and selection) and significantly less empirical research. We also found minimal research evidence that links HRM(AI) and organisational-level outcomes. To overcome this gap, we propose a multilevel framework that offers a platform for future researchers to draw linkage among diverse variables starting from the contextual level to HRM and organisational level outcomes that eventually enhance operational and financial organisational performance.}

Then, TRIZ evolution trends were modified to design concepts for digital transformation based on key enterprise processes. Finally, a novel service development maturity model was constructed to evaluate the new digital system design. A comprehensive empirical case study of designing “Customized Product Order Fulfillment System” for the laptop production process is conducted to demonstrate this approach. The proposed novel requirement-driven and strategy-based model is expected to provide valuable insights for suggestions on technological trends and forecasting, future diverse and innovative applications in customized order fulfillment scenarios.}

Top journals and scholars from various disciplines have published numerous highly impactful articles utilizing bibliometric techniques to study different fields’ evolutionary nuances and capture emerging trends. However, studies using bibliometric techniques have often attracted criticism for failing to adequately link their derived analytical and visual outputs with theory building and practice improvement. Consequently, we ask the following question: How can bibliometric research contribute to theory and practice? To this end, this editorial (i) premiers the characteristics and distinct contributions of bibliometric research and (ii) proposes a multifaceted approach that (a) researchers can utilize to develop and demonstrate the potential contributions of their bibliometric research and (b) referees (e.g., editors and reviewers) can rely on to effectively decipher and evaluate the framing, positioning, and contributions of bibliometric research. In doing so, we hope to enhance the understanding and contributions of bibliometric research in advancing theory and practice.}

A major strategy of the journal is to actively solicit and publish Special Issues (SIs). These SIs were first launched in 1979 to highlight and solicit manuscripts from the “hot” emerging issues of the discipline. This paper aims to analyze SIs and to highlight it's impact on TFSC as compared to Regular Issues (RIs). Using bibliometric analysis, this study first establishes that SIs have a higher impact on the field than RIs when evaluated based on average citations per manuscript, percentage of ‘hot’ papers, and the rate of citations per annum. The study then identifies leading actors (authors, affiliated institutions, and countries) and journals (knowledge inflow/outflow) that have contributed to the success of TFSC-SIs. Finally, using bibliographic coupling, seven thematic clusters of TFSC's SIs were identified. These clusters were compared with the knowledge clusters developed by Singh et al. (2020) for the entirety of TFSC journals, and four clusters unique to SIs were identified i.e. (Climate Change & Energy, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Sustainability and, Social Media & Internet of Things). It is observed that these unique SI clusters have received disproportionate attention during the last decade and are likely to influence the future trajectory of the journal.}

As with any technology, intelligence systems come with potential downsides. Despite the efforts to mitigate any negative consequences of AI, businesses and employees continue to confront the dilemmas of adopting AI, so it is essential to explore in detail the rising concerns around such technologies. In this paper, we used a single case study to investigate the dark aspects of AI in a Norwegian energy trading firm. We gathered data through semi-structured interviews and secondary data. Specifically, we interviewed AI managers, traders and developers who have worked on deploying and using AI tools over the last three years. Our aim is to identify the dark side of AI use in trading, how AI trading bots affect the relationship between traders and AI developers and how the firm adjusts to this new reality. The findings indicate that negative or unintended consequences of AI can be grouped into three clusters related to (1) the nature of the work; (2) conflicts and effects; and (3) responsibility. The paper concludes with future research and practical implications that can help organiziations mitigate the negative aspects of AI use.}

Data-driven start-ups are key actors in this transformation as they are often the first to commercialize novel digital technologies and influence business networks through their strategizing. Extant Industrial Marketing & Purchasing (IMP) literature has investigated roles and strategizing in business networks. However, understanding how data-driven start-ups' specificities impact their roles and strategizing is still at its infancy. Specifically, the authors conceptually show that assumptions on how data-driven start-ups strategize contradict strategizing tenets of prior IMP literature. Therefore, previous knowledge on strategizing needs further differentiation. Addressing this research need, theories-in-use and multiple case study research on 23 data-driven start-ups is conducted to examine (1) in what network roles they operate and (2) how they strategize within and across different network roles. The study extends IMP and data-driven business model research by identifying four network roles (enabler, extender, transformer, orchestrator) and developing a specific classification framework for data-driven start-ups. Furthermore, the study shows that IMP tenets apply in specific network roles only to some extent to data-driven start-ups. Finally, three strategizing trajectories are identified, which provide a dynamic perspective to IMP literature for guiding entrepreneurs on strategizing opportunities.}

The proposed model underwent rigorous evaluation through a human-coded study and was subsequently validated by a separate user response study. Our findings reveal that active-constructive responses significantly enhance the impact of positive reviews, whereas passive-constructive strategies are more effective in mitigating the damage from negative reviews. Additionally, the study underscores the importance of concise, personalized, and prompt responses across the board. Interestingly, responses that are overly explanatory, excessively empathetic, or challenge customers were found to be counterproductive when dealing with negative reviews. This study not only demystifies the art of managing online reviews but also offers an advanced deep learning methodology that can directly benefit the disciplines of Information Systems and Management.}

This research employed an internet-based Q methodology study to examine such “boundaries” within the Metaverse discourse. The study involved 46 participants from 14 countries and diverse sectors within the global Metaverse industry, who engaged in online card ranking exercises using statements covering five essential aspects of the Metaverse: Terminology, Cultural Values, Societal Impact, Economics, and Regulation. The factor analysis revealed four prominent frames of perspective: 1) Debating Liberal Globalism; 2) Critiques of the Metaverse as a Threat to Humanity; 3) The Metaverse as Neoliberalization; and 4) the New Prometheans: Techno-Optimism in the Digital Revolution. These frames underscore polarized perceptions related to the political-economic aspects of Metaverse development, particularly concerning affordability, infrastructure limitation, and digital literacy, all crucial for preventing global divisions. The findings contribute to policy dialogues focused on the social impact of technology innovation. Additionally, this research provides hands-on experience in designing and implementing a digitalized Q methodology, resulting in more systematic and transparent Q exercise procedures.}

As a result, it is seen as the cornerstone of Industry 4.0 and the wave of innovation to come since it connects virtual cyberspace with actual physical entities. Virtualization of machinery control, use of data analysis in decision-making, and information flow through the Internet are some trends in Industrial Digital Twins (IDTs). IDT is one of the possible digital technologies that are currently being developed to facilitate digital transformation and decision-making in many industrial sectors. Even after more than two decades, the concept of digital twin is continuously developing, taking new forms like IDT as it permeates industries and applications. This has led to an ever-growing diversity of definitions, which poses a danger to the concept’s clarity and might result in the technology’s use ineffectively. To define what qualifies an IDT and what does not, there is a requirement for a comprehensive description with well-defined criteria. A digital representation of a physical process enables safe management, remote control, and simulations of the process. This paper offers recommendations for creating a Digital Twin architecture that incorporates the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and modern technology, integrating aforementioned features in an experimental application. Additionally, the article concentrates on the IDT characteristics, major technological practices behind IDT, related sustainable solutions, and major use-cases. Furthermore, the existing challenges are explored with a specific focus on the open issues and related future opportunities.}

abstract = {Organizational creativity is increasingly deemed a crucial source of organizational effectiveness and competitive advantage. As several previous researches found that some human resource management (HRM) activities act as antecedents of organizational creativity, HR-related decisions are increasingly deemed as high stake decisions, as poor choices may originate large financial loss and may be very costly to reverse. For this reason, organizations are relying more and more on a data-driven approach also when it comes to HRM, for example by increasingly resorting to HR analytics tools to inform and guide the decision-making process. Consequently, the objective of this study is to empirically investigate the effect of an HRM data-driven approach on organizational creativity. Data were collected through online questionnaires addressed to 281 HR managers of heterogeneous companies from Europe and analyzed through a structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. Our results found employee training, organizational knowledge sharing, and recruitment and selection to be positively related to organizational creativity, and that HR analytics positively moderated these relationships. On the contrary, no significant effect was found regarding the relationship between employee rewards and incentives and organizational creativity, and neither regarding the moderating effect of HR analytics. Our study thus contributes to research regarding high stake decisions by empirically demonstrating HR analytics' positive impact on the decision-making process regarding the workforce, also in a peculiar context as organizational creativity. It also contributes to organizational creativity literature by clarifying the mixed findings regarding its antecedents. Finally, it provides further empirical confirmation of the contingency theory applied to HRM.}

Meanwhile, some motivating factors related to online retailers have been linked to product sales. While several articles have examined the impact between online reviews and motivating factors on product sales, many of the conclusions drawn are contradictory. From 28 studies focusing on online reviews and sales, this study performs a meta-analysis to analyze the true impacts of six review-related factors (i.e., the number of reviews, star ratings, standard deviation of ratings, helpfulness, review length and sentiment), and two motivating factors (i.e., price discounts and special shipping) on product sales. Meanwhile, this paper also studies how one product-related factor (i.e., product age) and one reviewer-related factor (i.e., reviewer's reputation) influence the relationship between online reviews and product sales. In addition, to study the moderating effect of product category, we divide the selected literature into two subgroups which are search and experience products. The results indicate that only review length and special shipping have no significant impact on product sales, while product category has a valid and specific moderating effect on the relationship between these determinants and sales. The presented conclusions will have important implications for academic research and for future industry practice.}

This has led to responsive efforts from multiple sectors of society to constrain the violation of individuals’ data privacy. Among these efforts, the regulations like GDPR are the most influential, which are believed to be able to change the foundation of the whole data ecosystem. The main concern of current regulation is data transparency, designed to enable individuals to make rational decisions about their data. However, I argue that transparency cannot mitigate a key issue of data privacy, which is the right of receiving benefits from data. This issue is getting severe with the rapid development of the data economy and will become the essential problem of social welfare and fairness in the AI era. I further point out that the key to solving this issue is to migrate the current centralized data utilization paradigm to a new decentralized paradigm. Based on the recent technical advancements, I propose an applicable pathway to implement such a paradigm. And to realize a fair and sustainable data eco-system, joint efforts should be made within this paradigm.}

The findings provide evidence of the significant benefits of digitalization related to company performance improvements and internal and external communication. Furthermore, results reveal that top management, human resources, and financial resources are the main drivers leading to digitalization. Finally, medium-sized companies are found to be more active in digital transformation. The paper addresses the critical point that training people in digitalization, especially in SMEs, is key to getting a more mature Management Control System (MCS) and reaching a higher level of performance. Secondly, widespread digitalization in many company processes is a critical success factor.

Based on 1931 county-level administrative units, this study used cluster analysis and a novel Bayesian Quantile Regression approach to explore the digitalization characteristics, and how digitalization influences urban-rural disparity at different disparity levels and in different regions. We found three types of digitalization development, including Balanced Digital Progression (29.26 %), Digital Consumption Powerhouse (17.50 %), and Digital Development Potential (53.24 %). Digitalization played an essential role in alleviating urban-rural disparity, with a more pronounced effect in areas with higher levels of disparity. The access to information infrastructure related to the first-level digital divide may exacerbate the urban-rural disparity, while the digitalization dimensions related to the second-level digital divide could mitigate the urban-rural disparity. Regarding the regional effects, information infrastructure adoption has different impacts on urban-rural disparity across various regions, while digitalization usage is consistently mitigating urban-rural disparities. By comprehensively examining the role of digitalization, we provided a scientific basis for formulating more precise and effective policies for a more balanced and integrated urban-rural development.}

We explore the impact of three product assortment characteristics–assortment width, perishability, and recommended diversity–on CGB sales and consumer behavior. Our assessment of CGB sales relies on sales revenue per group-buying for each store as a primary metric; the average item quantity per order (average basket size) and average item price in all orders (average item price) are utilized as fundamental indicators for evaluating consumer behavior. This study employs panel fixed effects models to analyze operational CGB data. Our results show that assortment width, perishability, and recommended diversity have significantly positive impacts on CGB sales. Furthermore, assortment width positively and significantly influences both the average basket size and average item price. The perishability of an assortment negatively affects the former but positively impacts the latter. Conversely, the recommended diversity of assortments positively impacts the average basket size but has a negative impact on the average item price. Additionally, holidays can moderate the impact of product assortments on CGB sales and consumer behavior.}

abstract = {Increase in global population growth and the consequent rise in the demand for food while ensuring quality, preventing wastage, avoiding deforestation, and carbon footprinting has put tremendous pressure on the global food supply chain (FSC). Due to fast computing facilities and availability of data, blockchain technology has emerged as a potential system that may help in developing a safe and secure FSC. Blockchain has gained significant attention among researchers worldwide, which is evident from the extensive literature generated on this subject within a span of a few years. Through this paper, the authors attempt to showcase the immense scope and significance of blockchain in FSCs by examining and analyzing the existing studies. In addition to providing an overview of the application of blockchain in FSCs, this study also discusses challenges such as scalability, interoperability, and high cost and suggests potential solutions for the existing difficulties in adopting blockchain in FSCs. Additionally, a bibliometric analysis is provided to acquaint researchers and practitioners with the structure and research trends in this area. The study found that researchers have mostly focused on the applicability of blockchain for product authentication, finance, and logistics. Further, blockchain is likely to become a dominant technology for enhancing transparency and traceability, reducing risk and, most importantly, enhancing trust among different stakeholders in the area of FSC.}

This can potentially reshape the interdependencies and interactions of complex systems, leading to our research question: To what extent and in which direction is the literature on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and System Dynamics (SD) converging within the business and management landscape? We conducted an extensive literature review using bibliometric and topic modeling methods to address this question. Through a bibliometric analysis, we identified the areas in which academic papers referred to both SD and AI literature. However, bibliometrics do not show a clear path towards convergence. The top modeling analysis highlights more details on how convergence is structured, providing insights into how SD and AI may be integrated. Two trajectories are identified. In the “soft convergence,” AI supports system dynamics analysis and modeling more deeply characterized by social interaction. In the “hard convergence,” AI shapes innovative ways of rethinking system design, dynamics, and interdependencies. Our analysis suggests that while soft convergence is more visible in the business and management landscape, hard convergence may well represent a new frontier in studying system dynamics with the potential to reshape the landscape.}

This study aims at exploring if the individuals' reactions to the technological themes presented through sci-fi creative products and conveyed through social media may become a source of information for innovating firms, that may consequently affect their technology development processes. To answer our research question, we relied on the individuals’ reactions to the sci-fi series Black Mirror conveyed through Twitter and on patents related to the technological themes presented in the series. Results show that in most cases there is a significant variation in social media engagement about the presented technology after the first airing of the episode and, in a subset of cases we found a significant variation in the mean number of related patents filed per day, that can be associated with an actual change in the technology development processes.}

The results demonstrate that for business exposed to AML, their digital commitment and digital innovation have achieved considerable enhancements. However, digitalization remains a strategic endeavor for some enterprises without substantial enhancements in digital innovation capacity. Dynamic effects document that while the short-term digitization effect of AML is prominent, there are long-term risks of failure. Moreover, the benefits are more pronounced in non-internet, state-owned enterprises, and enterprises in the growth and maturity stage. While compliance costs challenge enterprise digitization, AML mitigates it by curbing market power and facilitating talent mobility. Our findings provide valuable managerial insights for sustainable digitization performance by emphasizing establishing internal digital ethics guidelines, proactively embracing social responsibility, and promoting inter-enterprise collaboration.}

Interest in this area has increased significantly in recent years, and an increasing number of firms employ this approach, especially in the early stages of the innovation process, in which context design thinking is used to gain insights into user needs and generate new ideas. However, empirical evidence regarding the timing and process associated with the deployment of design thinking during the three different phases of the innovation process (fuzzy front end, development and testing, and commercialization) remains very limited. This gap may hinder research and practical advancements regarding when and how to implement design thinking in the innovation process. We explore this problem through a case study of a leading Chinese technology firm in the refrigeration industry using a longitudinal lens. We show that when and how the firm uses the four design thinking practices—(1) user-centeredness, (2) embracing diversity, (3) visualization and (4) iteration—to enable a transition from the fuzzy front end to development and testing and ultimately to commercialize a new product. Moreover, our findings suggest that the firm needs to adapt to the changing innovation goals and dynamically adjusts the content and intensity of design thinking practices as the innovation phase progresses. These findings therefore offer practical guidance for managers adopting design thinking to promote innovation.}

From a configurational perspective, this study investigates how different combinations of innovation activities and strategies influence firm performance. Twenty combinative effects of four categories of innovation activities and five strategic types on two firm performance measures (growth and profit) were explored, resulting in the creation of an innovation-strategy alignment map. This study contributes to innovation strategy literature by providing the alignment map, where four configurational clusters with equifinality were identified. It also contributes to competitive strategy literature by offering empirical verification for the “pure” versus “hybrid” debate and identifying two new types of hybrids with more and different strategic dimensions by using an empirical method, thus advancing the call for more detailed hybrid strategy research in this area. In addition, the innovation-strategy alignment map provides options to managers with different resources and capacities for effective planning.}

To address this research gap, we introduce a new construct termed “social capacitance,” which refers to how social media can help organizations’ absorptive capacity development, leading to organizational innovation, long-term success, and competitive advantage. Using an integrative capacitive-coupling framework, we theorize the antecedents and consequences of social capacitance in consumer–firm interactions, firm–consumer interactions, consumer–consumer interactions, and firm–firm interactions using social media platforms.}

We examine 464 surveys of users who had previous experiences on various related APPs in the sharing economy and present empirical results supporting that APP assessments play mediator roles among perceived benefits and purchasing intention. The research model shows that relational, attitude, and capability benefits are consumers’ three main perceived benefits that influence their purchasing intention. This study thus offers management and marketing implications in the sharing economy by suggesting that firms increase consumers’ perceived benefits in order to raise APP assessments, thereby spurring their intention to use the APPs to finalize their final purchase behavior.}

In addition they focus on two specific categories: to further enhance a strong capability around their unique differentiation based around existing resources - their physical stores; also to focus on one of the attackers’ strongest capabilities - a rapid response to changing GENz customer trends. The strategic choice of which capabilities to enhance is driven by a goal to increase an existing advantage, or match the attacker's advantage, or both.

In an era where mass marketing techniques are inadequate, lead management is at the forefront to provide a customized approach to customer acquisition. For this, lead management depends on the correct selection of leads and decision making on what type of approach to take to satisfy the requirements of customers. However, currently, firms are faced with massive quantity of data regarding customers and prospects. Data mining is a solution to cope with this problem, providing a robust approach to massive quantity of data and its complexity. In literature, there is a lack of documented applications of these techniques in lead management. In this sense, we propose a methodology that aims to improve efficiency on the distinct maturity stages of leads management. Also, the methodology aids in support the decision-making regarding the segmentation of leads. This research suggests the application of data mining techniques in the optimization of leads management processes, from capture to conversion, with the objective of improving customer conversion effectiveness. A case study was conducted in a telecommunications company. It was possible to implement the proposed method to estimate the probability of conversion for each lead. With this, was possible to segment the offer to each type of lead.}

Consequently, there is not a clear understanding of the underlying enabling technologies required to implement it. That makes it more difficult for players to plan a migration strategy. This paper proposes a technological pathway infrastructure from Industry 3.0 (I3.0) to I4.0, based on the analysis of research and academic involvement in this transition process. A bibliometric study was directed to academic work, while field research addressed industry practitioners. The purpose of field research is to understand the impact of the knowledge about the transition from I3.0 up to I4.0. The contribution of this study includes a construct showing the fundamental technology infrastructure to pave the way from I3.0 up to I4.0.

Analyzing data from 2138 Australians and 1760 New Zealanders, we employ a two-step clustering method—(1) hierarchical clustering and (2) k-means clustering—to categorize consumers on the basis of their demographic and lifestyle preferences into three segments that capture differences in attitudes toward new agricultural technologies: “Green Urbanites,” “Environmentally Unconcerned,” and “Skeptical Foodie.” Our findings reveal that Green Urbanites are the most open to adopting CEA, GE, and FA, while Skeptical Foodies and Environmentally Unconcerned are more reluctant. We contribute to theory by studying a novel facet of consumer acceptance of sustainable technologies and revealing how consumption, living, and lifestyle patterns motivate new technology acceptance in the agricultural sector. To inform practice, we suggest tailored strategies to increase engagement of the identified segments and promote wider acceptance of sustainable agricultural practices for enhanced food security.}

Exploring the impact mechanisms and resilience of tourism systems provides new research perspectives on their ability to withstand vulnerability and promote sustainable development. This paper uses panel data from 2006 to 2021 as the research sample, and the resilience index for the tourism sector is constructed based on the DPSIR theory, using the entropy right TOPSIS method. The fixed effects model verifies the effect on tourism system resilience, while the mediation effect is tested through a mediation model. The research results show that: (1) the composite index of tourism system resilience in 31 provinces is on the rise, and the spatial distribution of ecological impact types in China is distinct due to geological variations, the temperature zone between the north and south, and the terrain between the east and west; (2) ecological impacts significantly and positively influence tourism system resilience, as established after various robustness tests; (3) there is some intermediary effect between ecological impacts and tourism system resilience; (4) ecological impact varies across different economic cycles.}

Nevertheless, the widespread adoption of the trend hinges on a thorough comprehension of consumers' switching intention from traditional human influencers to virtual influencers as viable alternatives. Given that past studies have primarily concentrated on assessing the overall impact of determinants without delving into the intricacies of behaviours, this study endeavours to develop and substantiate an asymmetric framework incorporating AI technology-like (here, hedonic motivation, expected performance and privacy disclosure concern), human-like (here, anthropomorphism and perceived intelligence), social attributes (here, social influence) and consumer personalities (here, extroversion, introversion and open-mindedness) shedding light on consumers' switching intention to virtual influencers. An online questionnaire was conducted in the United Kingdom and was analysed using an integrated approach that combines fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) and Necessary Conditions Analysis. The results unveiled six configurations of arrangements, each characterised by a unique combination of causation. This study contributes value to virtual influencers and endorsement literature by developing an innovative research method for uncovering the intricacies associated with the switching intention. Furthermore, it provides practical recommendations for social media practitioners on how to optimise the balance between AI technology-like, human-like and social attributes based on consumer personalities, thus enhancing the successful implementation of virtual influencers.}

Using SMART PLS4 software, the study measures and analyses these linkages quantitatively. The findings emphasize the significant influence of customers' environmentally conscious attitudes and awareness on their inclination to buy eco-friendly products. Moreover, the study uncovers a significant moderating impact of environmental awareness in connecting pro-environmental sentiments to consumer purchasing behavior.

In the era of artificial intelligence under the new economic normal, the diffusion of technological innovation not only catalyzes the internal components and external environment of entrepreneurship, but more importantly reconstructs a new combination of the key success factors (KSFs) for entrepreneurship. Technological innovation-driven entrepreneurship, as a new form of entrepreneurship, poses new challenges to the traditional entrepreneurial process theory. Using the Co-citation Context Analysis (CCA) method, we innovated the operational definition of the KSFs of entrepreneurship, and horizontally displayed 4 stages of the entrepreneurial process, including 66 key success factors in 17 dimensions. We used the explanatory structural modeling method and Matrice d'Impacts Croises-Multipication Applique A Classement (MICMAC) to analyze and identify the driving force and dependence force of KSFs, and longitudinally present the multi-level structural process relationship of the systematic entrepreneurial process. Our research focuses on three aspects: (1) To find out the KSFs of innovation-driven entrepreneurial processes. (2) To explore the relationship between internal drivers and new combinations of external dynamic environmental factors in the process of systematic entrepreneurship. (3) To demonstrate the common characteristics of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) entrepreneurs' teamwork, innovation drive and competitiveness. The results show that entrepreneurial performance, entrepreneurial environment, and entrepreneurial group characteristics are still the basic elements of the entrepreneurial process, but in the era of artificial intelligence under the new economic normal, the KSFs of the systematic entrepreneurial process are changing dynamically, interactively and iteratively. The two-way influence and criss-cross evolution of the driving force and dependence of the KSFs in the entrepreneurial process promote the occurrence of innovation-driven entrepreneurship, which is a topic that initial entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs must pay attention to.}

Using thematic analysis, 880 factors are identified and grouped into 29 themes, which offer a comprehensive overview of the literature. Using statistical analysis, the identified factors are dissected into technological (T), organisational (O), and environmental (E) dimensions (the TOE framework). Themes are further classified as barriers (B), enablers (En), and ambiguous (A) to describe a firm's readiness for blockchain adoption (the BEnA framework). We emphasise the multidimensionality of adoption factors across the TOE dimensions and the conditionality of adoption enablers across the BEnA dimensions. Analysis of research trends shows that recent blockchain adoption literature has focused on elaborating upon existing research themes (involution) rather than on developing new themes (evolution). Based on our analyses, we propose future research directions, including scrutinising the interdependence and multidimensionality of blockchain adoption factors, further examining factors with conditional or unclear effects on adoption, and broadening the contextual, temporal, and theoretical aspects of blockchain adoption research.}

Given that firms are accelerating digital transformation (DT), clarifying the connection between DT and firms’ bargaining power remains to be determined. Therefore, this research, utilizing data from Chinese listed firms, demonstrates a positive association between digital transformation and firms’ bargaining power when dealing with suppliers and customers. After addressing endogeneity concerns and conducting alternative robustness checks, this result remains robust. Furthermore, mechanism analysis reveals that the positive connection is mediated by higher firms’ innovation capabilities, optimized human capital structures, and lower transaction costs. Moreover, this positive nexus is weaker among firms located upstream in the supply chain and those with lower competitiveness, and stronger when firms face high economic uncertainty. Overall, these findings theoretically contribute to Schumpeterian innovation and human capital theories and provide managerial suggestions for firms to enhance their bargaining power.}

Using a dataset of 562 Chinese SMEs from 2011 to 2020, we find that SMEs’ digitalization has a positive impact on their OFDI levels, measured using both the number of overseas subsidiaries and the number of host countries. This effect is mediated by a firm’s dynamic capability and moderated by top managers’ international experience and industry competitive intensity.

Through bibliographic coupling, a technique that identifies emergent research trends rather than past traditions in literature, we analyse the current state of CE research in business management and develop an agenda for future research. Six streams emerge: strategy, learning and innovation, consumer behaviour and remanufacturing, supply chains and implementation, circular business models, industrial symbiosis, and emerging technologies. Through content analysis we explore research trends and gaps, providing a more comprehensive overview of CE management research than prior studies. Moreover, we identify promising paths for future research, focused around three overarching research questions that provide a platform to accelerate the impact of business and management research on the adoption and proliferation of CE practices in future.}

This study evaluates how two fundamental such organizational choices – i.e., strategic emphasis on value creation activities over value appropriation activities, and outsourcing intensity – affect firm profitability, along with the moderating role of firm size. Analysis of longitudinal archival data, collected for a sample of 176 manufacturing firms engaged in digital servitization, reveals several noteworthy relationships. Greater relative emphasis on value creation activities negatively impacts firm profitability, but to an extent that decreases with firm size. In addition, while outsourcing intensity has a positive direct effect on firm profitability, the relationship is observed to change with the size of the firm; that is, greater outsourcing intensity may lead to lower profitability in the case of large firms. For managers of manufacturing firms, the study provides insights that may help tackle the implementation challenges of digital servitization, enhancing their abilities to determine appropriate resource allocation strategies and configurations of value chain activities to increase financial performance. The appropriate organizational choices vary with the size of the firm.}

This evolution is enabled by digital ecosystems composed of the digital infrastructure pool and the digital enablement pool. Digital technologies and infrastructure reduce transaction and access costs, and enable new organizing models of the sharing economy through digital enablement mechanisms of integration and value appropriation, renewal and moderation, and updating and upgrading.

An EEG experiment also reveals that users pay less attention (a lower P2 amplitude) to the UEP (vs. PEP), decreasing the complexity of decision-making (a lower N2 amplitude). This effect persists even when the perceptual load is low but is attenuated under a high perceptual load. The current study contributes to the literature on linguistic framing and privacy disclosure, providing guidelines for platforms to effectively and ethically acquire users' private information.}

This study suggests on the fBComp as a new “social” business model (SBM) which integrates social and competitive behaviors. Thereby, the company achieves its objectives by creating and maintaining biunivocal relations with stakeholders, co-creating contextual sustainability conditions, increasing its reputation and positioning compared to its competitors.

abstract = {The emerging digital technologies have brought about new changes to the servitization of manufacturing enterprises and resource allocation efficiency. Besides that, in the Chinese manufacturing industry, the ratio of listed companies between state-owned and non-state-owned enterprises is approximately 4:1, which also influences the resource allocation efficiency. This study establishes a comprehensive set of indicators encompassing workforce composition, financial investments, servitization propensity, and performance outcomes to gauge the holistic level of servitization among publicly traded manufacturing companies. The objective is to investigate the impact of servitization on the efficiency of resource allocation among firms within the industry. During the initial phases of servitization, the introduction of services renders products less substitutable. Consequently, some firms experience an increase in pricing levels, while others witness a reduction. This divergence in pricing strategies results in decreased resource allocation efficiency among firms. As the servitization process progresses, companies with initially high pricing levels reach a saturation point in their servitization journey, while those with lower pricing levels intensify their servitization efforts. This shift leads to an enhancement in product substitution elasticity among firms, thereby fostering an improvement in resource allocation. Notably, firms with higher levels of servitization tend to incorporate digital technologies into their service processes. They leverage information collection and data matching to formulate personalized and differentiated service strategies, consequently elevating the distinctiveness of their products. However, this transformation may also precipitate a reduction in resource allocation efficiency within the industry. It is imperative to underscore that the impact of manufacturing servitization on resource allocation efficiency varies across different regions in China, different sectors characterized by varying factor intensities, and different ownership structures. This impact is particularly conspicuous among non-state-owned enterprises, which indirectly underscores the relatively subdued competitive intensity among state-owned enterprises and the inadequacies in market-driven dynamics.}

The fragmented research on this important subject poses challenges for firms aiming to navigate and capitalize on ecosystem orchestration. To bridge this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive qualitative meta-analysis of 31 case studies and identified multifaceted orchestration practices employed by industrial firms. The core contribution of this research is the illumination of five interdependent but interrelated orchestration practices: strategic design, relational, resource integration, technological, and innovation. Together, these practices are synthesized into an integrative framework termed the “Stirring Model,” which serves as a practical guide to the orchestration practices. Furthermore, the conceptual framework clarifies the synergy between the identified practices and highlights their collective impact. This study proposes theoretical and practical implications for ecosystem orchestration literature and suggests avenues for further research.}

Specifically, we investigate a campaign against texting while driving which has been classified as a health epidemic. The campaign, started in 2010, included mass media and digital advertising, and tweets. Our results indicate that digital advertising and tweets by the campaign stimulated retweets of the campaign’s tweets as well as new tweets by people. We further find that people’s tweets reduce the extent of texting while driving. While based on a single campaign, our results suggest that public health campaigns can use social media to generate online word of mouth to change risky behaviors.}

The findings suggest that there is a decrease in service warmth among employees when they collaborate with service robots, as compared to when they collaborate with human colleagues. The reduced social interaction in robot-assisted collaboration contributes to increased emotional exhaustion among employees, leading to a decline in their service warmth. Notably, maintaining high-quality customer interactions helped alleviate employee emotional exhaustion from reduced social interaction with robot co-workers. This validates a relational approach emphasizing positive customer exchanges to replenish employee emotional reserves depleted by the impersonal nature of human-robot collaboration.}

Furthermore, results reveal that breadth (the variety of SDG-related themes covered) and concentration (the distribution of non-financial disclosure among the SDGs) operate as moderators in the above relationship. On the other hand, depth (the total volume of the SDG-based information) appears not to be significant. Finally, this study enriches the debate by providing a new data operationalization process to measure the firm's commitment to the SDGs of the 2030 Agenda.}

To address this research gap, this study examines the relationship between user whole-process engagement, value emergence, resource integration, and firm performance from the perspective of resource integration combined with complex systems theory. A questionnaire survey of 377 digital enterprises in different industries in China was conducted; subsequently, the theoretical model was tested by using empirical and experimental methods. The empirical results showed that the emergence of efficiency and integrated value played a mediating role in the relationship between user whole-process engagement and firm performance. Resource integration positively moderated the relationship between user whole-process engagement and value emergence. Simultaneously, value emergence promoted the improvement of multidimensional performance of enterprise platforms, and its impact on a firm's social performance was greater as compared to that on the firm's economic performance. Thus, the research has interesting implications for theory, enterprises, and government.}

In this study, a sample of 127 project managers were asked to evaluate and recommend modes of SM development for six diverse firms using a four-part taxonomy. The results show that firms of varying size can employ narrowly focused and low cost SM development modes to meet their business objectives, with well-resourced firms able to use experimental modes to deliver widespread and higher cost ‘listen and learn’ SM systems. Alternatively, in addition to achieving groundswell promotions and broader business marketing and sales influencing objectives, firms that engage in large scale SM developments can document and implement SM best practices and apply multi-organizational collaborations required for information exchange, customer feedback and experience sharing. These managerial perspectives expose the intrinsic connections between SM systems and information messaging and management within firms. The article builds further into cumulative studies directed at SM systems construction, deployment, and firm capability affordances.}

The theoretical framework is integrated with the institutional theory and the resource-based view (RBV). The empirical method is used for collecting data through surveys and further covariance-based structural equation modeling is used to test the hypotheses. Findings indicate that carbon–neutral-based government policies have a stronger influence on tangible resources and human skills than intangible resources related to Industry 4.0 driven smart manufacturing. Second, carbon–neutral policy alignment with the firm’s sustainability objectives plays a moderating effect on the relationship between carbon–neutral-based government policies and resources (tangible, intangible resources and human skills) for Industry 4.0 driven smart manufacturing. Lastly, the three resources (tangible, intangible resources and human skills) for Industry 4.0 driven smart manufacturing play a critical role in developing firms’ carbon–neutral capability and further enhancing operational performance. Managerial implications include investment in advanced digital technologies, developing a strong mindset among employees and supply chain stakeholders, and designing training programs for enhancing smart manufacturing performance to develop carbon-neutrality capability.

However, having more data is not enough; the data should also be of high quality. For example, taking action based on unfamiliar evidence, speculative ideas, or observations could lead to the wastage of resources. Whereas using high-quality data will help achieve correct results. Synthetic data is artificially generated data. Synthetic data is generated by an algorithm and used to represent real-world data, test datasets, perform mathematical model validation, and, most importantly, for training of machine learning models. Synthetic data can also be used to preserve data privacy. It is considered a safe way to transfer sensitive data because it creates a transaction database that does not contain any confidential information. This paper compares the tabular synthetic data generation techniques using various datasets, viz. balanced datasets, unbalanced datasets, datasets with numerical attributes only, datasets with categorical attributes only and mixed datasets. The utility of the generated synthetic data is measured using the Propensity score metric and Cluster-Log metric. The main finding of this paper is that the Classification And Regression Tree (CART) model provides the best results for all types of datasets. At the same time, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) give subpar or mediocre results at best. This contradicts the common belief that GANs are the go-to models for producing synthetic data.}

Such global disruptions fundamentally alter the course of international business affairs through a range of events spanning from natural disasters to political upheavals, economic downturns, pandemics, and technological advancements. These disruptions are widespread and cause multinational enterprises (MNEs) to face challenges and uncertainties that obstruct their success. The concept of organizational resilience has developed as a critical factor for firms to not only survive but thrive when faced with adversities. This research examines the multilevel elements of organizational resilience through a dynamic process model to enable MNEs to navigate change, adapt to adversity, and sustain success at five levels: (1) individual, (2) organizational, (3) ecosystem, (4) institutional, and (5) global. By embracing a dynamic approach to organizational resilience, MNEs canthrive against uncertainty and seize profitable opportunities in a challenging business environment.}

abstract = {With the emergence of the digital economy, the occupational landscape in many countries has undergone major transformations. While scholars have started to study the working conditions of digital economy occupations such as app-based food delivery couriers and social media influencers, assessing societal perceptions of these occupations remains uncharted territory. This article provides a substantive contribution through an in-depth analysis of occupational prestige and occupational social value perceptions across 76 UK digital economy occupations. Leveraging two expansive surveys with more than 2400 respondents, the findings show that these nascent occupations tend to have modest prestige, and that their perceived social value is lower than that of analogous non-digital occupations. Socio-economic factors and attitudes foster variability in societal perceptions. The research thus advances a nuanced understanding of the evolving digital economy, providing evidence for fellow researchers, policymakers, and the larger public, for whom the results help contextualize career choices and occupational identities.}

However, pharmaceutical technology innovation has become complicated and increasingly diverse. The current TRMs do not adapt well to this new reality. In response, this study proposes a systematic and specific framework to develop a pharmaceutical technology roadmap. Compared with standardized TRM, this TRM proposes three improvements. The first extension is the designing of the layers. The second extension is the selecting of the data source. The last extension is the processing of data sources. To validate the proposed framework, a case study in the field of hyperuricemia drugs was conducted. Our analysis focuses on the construction of a pharmaceutical TRM framework and a review of technology topics from multiple data sources that can supply quantitative information to explore the current trends. The analyzed results can assist the research and development professionals to predict technological opportunities and support experts to make more reasonable decision-making for a particular pharmaceutical domain.}

Digitalisation has gained weight in all aspects of our lives, and from the point of view of the health system we find an example in the slow historical adoption of telemedicine, which contrasts sharply with the massive conversion to this technology as a tool for social distancing. In this sense, the homebound population is the one most affected by the pandemic and the one that could benefit the most from the use of telemedicine. Using a netnography approach and based on the stimulus-organism-response paradigm, this study proposes to analyse the evolution of perception about telemedicine using the opinions expressed on Twitter. The primary technical tasks of the study incorporate the analysis of topics and the review of emotions and positive image perception using natural language processing. Specifically, tweets about telemedicine generated by the Spanish community are analysed in this work. The findings show that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected emotions and topics of interest related to telemedicine. This has changed the image that it had and the behaviour of the Twitter community in Spain. In conclusion, the study results suggest that changes in health systems affect people's emotions and behaviours.}

This paper focuses on the financial information service industry in the context of the COVID-19, and discusses the information service quality of financial information service providers (fintech platforms vs. analysts) from the perspective of individual investors' cognition. Based on the theory of organizational information processing, through survey method, it has been found that investors believe that the information service quality of fintech platforms is higher than that of analysts, and is mediated by information planning comprehensiveness. It was also found that economic environment uncertainty moderates the mediating information service providers and information service quality through information planning comprehensiveness. Specifically, in a low economic environment uncertainty (Non-Lockdown Policy), investors believe that financial technology platforms have higher information planning comprehensiveness and higher quality of information services compared to analyst; In a high economic environment uncertainty (Lockdown Policy), the aforementioned impact is weakened. Robustness results indicate that the above main effects remain when considering the sub-sample and investors' Internet search behaviour. In addition, the heterogeneity results indicate that the more economically developed the region, the higher the investors' evaluation of the quality of financial information services. This study promotes the understanding of fintech substitution effect from the perspective of investor perception and reveals the psychological mechanism of individual investors, which provides micro ideas for the governance of fintech platforms for new participants in startups' financing and regional fintech development.}

However, the mechanisms that lead to the impact on business performance are still elusive. The circular economy is one of the most recent approaches to address sustainability challenges. Drawing on the perspective of information technology-enabled organizational capabilities and contingency theory, this study is one of the first to analyze how information systems capabilities enable circular economy practices to become higher-order capabilities that enhance business performance, as well as the moderation that environmental uncertainty exerts on this relationship. Using partial least squares path modeling, empirical evidence demonstrates that circular economy practices fully mediate the relationship between information systems capabilities and business performance. Meanwhile, environmental uncertainty negatively moderates both the impact of circular economy practices on business performance and the mediation of circular economy practices in the information systems capabilities-business performance relationship. For managers, this research demonstrates how embedding information systems capabilities into organizational processes for transitioning to a circular economy model can present economic benefits depending upon the uncertainty within their specific operating environment. Finally, our mediation analysis method combines predictive and causal techniques with partial least squares structural equation modeling and applies a compelling approach to testing conditional mediation effects.}

A key challenge for OIPs is how to motivate users’ idea contributions. The support community appears as a Q&A section in a few OIPs, in which the special role of user behavior on individuals’ idea contribution is understudied. Based on a theoretical synthesis of innovation management studies, we propose hypotheses regarding the spillover effects of user interactions in a support community (i.e., help giving and help seeking) on individuals’ innovation performance (i.e., the quantity and quality of ideas). Using a dataset from a typical OIP, we employ two empirical studies to investigate the spillover effects of user interactions and their characteristics, including breadth and depth, on innovation performance. Our results confirm the existence of spillover effects and reveal a positive effect of interaction breadth and a nonlinear effect of interaction depth on innovation. Notably, the nonlinear relationship can be moderated by the interaction breadth. Our findings provide both theoretical and practical implications for user innovation and OIP operations.}

It diverges from previous theoretical and intuitive approaches, by providing concrete data-driven insights. The role of digitalization in enhancing productivity and spatial efficiency is a critical outcome here, thereby encouraging industries to favor urban areas. It also reveals an unexpected nuance: digitalization does not directly correlate with clean production, challenging prevalent assumptions. By empirically validating the indirect pathways linking digitalization with urban industrial setting, this study contributes uniquely toward understanding technological advancements’ reshaping of urban industrial landscapes. This nuanced insight extends beyond the current discourse, emphasizing the indirect yet substantial influence of digitalization on industrial location choices.

Therefore, companies are increasingly leveraging technology to enhance their processes and gain a competitive edge. In this context, the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in e-commerce has become a crucial area for business development. However, there is currently a lack of understanding regarding the key factors that determine the adoption of AI in e-commerce by small and medium-sized enterprises. Thus, to fill this gap, this study aims to investigate the factors influencing the adoption of AI tools in e-commerce for SMEs. This study will also explore how the adoption of AI by SMEs contributes to the business performance of these organizations. To achieve this, the study proposes an integrated model based on the dynamic capabilities framework, entrepreneurial orientation, and customer-centric systems. Empirical data for the current study were collected using a digital survey, which was disseminated to a purposive sample of SMEs in Saudi Arabia. Analysis of the collected data was performed using structural equation modeling (SEM), and the results support the role of both dynamic capabilities and entrepreneurial orientation in facilitating the adoption of AI in e-commerce. The study confirms of the significant role of AI adoption in enhancing the business performance of SMEs. This study seeks to make several theoretical contributions and implications for practice. This will also provide small and medium-sized companies with valuable insights that help in making decisions and building strategies. However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of this study, which will be discussed later in the paper.}

This conceptual paper aims to explore challenges facing the strategic development of TPLs within a context of increased digitalization, e-commerce and servitization. There are two apparent strategic paths. Under circumstances of strong price pressure, there is demand for standardized TPL services offering simplicity, minimalism and functionality based on digitalization, e-commerce and servitization. Alternatively, with market developments responsive to supply chain complexity, digitalization, e-commerce and servitization enable development towards innovation and change. We conclude that these developments do not invalidate existing frameworks for TPL strategies but contribute alternative strategies. We formulate three propositions for each strategic path. To avoid being stuck in the middle, TPLs are encouraged to either develop efficient services through servitized logistics chains and digital solutions or develop advanced solutions to integrate the consumer into the logistics network system through competencies to control increased levels of complexity.}

As the role of teachers in entrepreneurship is moving to a posture of support and accompaniment in the absence of other professional training, this evolution raises the issue of how teachers of entrepreneurship can manage interactions during class. This topic of entrepreneurial education is significantly underinvestigated, as studies on the role and teaching methods of the entrepreneurship educator have only recently emerged. Considering that pedagogical innovations are contributing to this evolution and the multitude of studies realized in the field of entrepreneurship education, we led a systematic literature review (SLR) covering 1059 scientific documents from 1981 to 2022 indexed in Dimensions.ai, Web of Science (WoS), and Scopus to identify the current research trends linked to 10 active learning methods for entrepreneurship. Since it was more helpful and important to consider the entrepreneurship course as an ecosystem to better understand the interactions played within it, we completed the study inspired by ecological and biotic interaction theories that informed a new approach that highlights the importance of teachers developing social intelligence to build learner-centric environments.}

Theoretically, the paper discusses how collaborating with stakeholders with diverse motives and interests affects the development of diverse types of innovations; and whether and how a focal organisation's access to diverse information sources may influence the behaviour of different types of collaborators. The empirical analysis is based on Spanish Technological Innovation Panel (2015–2016) data. The results show that collaborations with secondary (primary) stakeholders are typically associated with the likelihood of developing eco-innovations (product and process innovations) and increased demand for skilled workers. We also find that access to diverse information sources is associated with the likelihood of collaborating with primary stakeholders only.}

The results show that in the spatial dimension, there is a significant spatial correlation between digital economy and green innovation in each city, and the regional heterogeneity of digital economy is higher than that of the west in the east, and the regional heterogeneity of green innovation is high and high agglomeration in the east of the city cluster, and high and low agglomeration in the west of the city cluster; there is a trend of incremental increase of the level of digital economy and green innovation in the temporal dimension, and the regional imbalance of the development of green innovation among cities is decreasing. The regional imbalance in the development of green innovation between cities is narrowing, and it tends to be more towards the synergistic development of a unified big market; the spatial measurement model shows that the digital economy not only has a significant impact on the level of green innovation in its own region, but also has a positive spatial spillover effect on the neighboring regions. The research in this paper helps to clarify the connection between digital economy and green innovation among regions, and provides decision-making reference for building a modernized innovation system and efficiently promoting the construction of beautiful China in the new period.}

abstract = {Although channel integration is vital to manage multiple channels in harmony, most research focuses on direct and indirect channels. However, hotels increasingly engage with platforms – an interface bringing together a network of hotels and customers. Channels and platforms have distinct attributes – channels facilitate economies of scale, while platforms foster network effects, i.e., growing the number of hotels and customers for the benefit of both parties. Therefore, we question whether channel integration capabilities are relevant in platform contexts. Furthermore, because platforms have high market power which affects hotel profitability, research is required to explore the specialized platform integration capabilities for optimal hotel performance. Applying grounded theory, we identify five coordinating capabilities for hotels to align their operations with platforms and three learning capabilities for hotels to develop new knowledge to work with platforms. Our contribution is the explication of the similarities and differences between channel integration and platform integration: (i) one set of integration capabilities are similar across channels and platforms – they manifest similarly and serve similar objectives. However, in platform contexts (ii) some integration capabilities satisfy different objectives, (iii) some are wider in scope to achieve a broader set of objectives, and (iv) some are unique and attain new objectives.}

This paper aims to reveal the crucial facts and patterns regarding the status quo of the recruitment market for blockchain-related jobs in China and clarify the heterogeneous nature of professionals demanded by blockchain-related jobs. We propose a data-driven approach by combining descriptive statistics, topic modeling, and regression analysis based on large-scale job posting data collected from a nationwide Chinese recruitment website. By this approach, we provide an overall picture of the landscape of the recruitment market for blockchain-related jobs and identify 11 skill sets that are most in-demand for blockchain-related jobs. On this basis, the skill sets of Blockchain Development and Cryptocurrency have emerged to be the most valued ones that affect salary levels: the talents mastering these two skill sets can obtain 21.4%, 10.4% higher average salaries, respectively, than those without these skills. The analyses also provide evidence that employers could attach importance to job candidates with T-shaped characteristics. Drawing on the findings, we also provide implications for blockchain practitioners.}

This paper uses computer-aided textual analysis to explore the current trend of SSIDMP in UK companies. Our debate draws on data from UK companies, FTSEE ALL Share, over the period (2012−2021). We develop proxies for I4.0 technologies and CE techniques to examine the synergy between I4.0 technologies and CE techniques and the influence of this synergy on companies' financial performance. The findings reveal the vital role the organizational ambidexterity plays in the synergy between I4.0 technologies and CE techniques through exploring and exploiting technological techniques and mechanisms to cope with changing business environment. Our empirical study explores the impact of governance mechanisms on the relationships between SSIDMP, I4.0 technologies, CE techniques, and companies' financial performance. Findings support that synergy between these two domains is the key determinant of sustainable value creation and sustainable organizational performance. The synergy between I4.0 technologies and CE techniques significantly impact SSIDMP and companies' financial performance, though the level of the synergy varies according to industry sectors. Furthermore, our analysis shows that governance mechanisms (ESG, board compositions, risk management, internal audit) strengthen the relationships between these two domains and companies' performance.}

Among emerging digital technologies, digital platforms are shaping and outgrowing the e-commerce channel representing a potential opportunity for manufacturing SMEs to embrace digital transformation. Drawing on affordance theory, this research uses a mixed method approach to investigate how manufacturing SMEs’ e-commerce commitment and digital platform adoption stimulate the actualization of three e-commerce affordances: consumer knowledge generation, internationalization, and customer diversification. Based on survey responses from 165 manufacturing SME managers, we find that direct selling through owned websites actualizes consumer knowledge generation and internationalization, indirect selling actualizes customer diversification and internationalization, and agency selling through third-party platforms actualizes all three affordances. The relationship between e-commerce commitment and ecommerce performance is mediated by consumer knowledge generation and internationalization but not by customer diversification. A fsQCA analysis outlines seven configurations actualizing these e-commerce affordances by pairing different ecommerce approaches with degrees of e-commerce commitment. Finally, an analysis of open-ended questions from 24 respondents complements the study and deeply interprets the seven unique configurations outlined.}

It is conducive to the creation, development, and sustainment of innovation in digital ventures. However, the building blocks of any digital entrepreneurial ecosystem remain loosely integrated and under-orchestrated in the early stages of its evolution. The entrepreneurial organizations that act as matchmakers and transaction catalysts have thus come to play significant roles in digital entrepreneurial ecosystems’ functioning, but the understanding of these roles remains relatively limited. Through an in-depth qualitative study of the organizational category observed within multi-channel network (MCN) organizations, a new type of intermediary role was identified and conceptualized as that of a facilitator in live streaming e-commerce, a new role in the digital entrepreneurial ecosystem. The findings suggest that the category emergence of facilitators is based on resource orchestration in the dimensions of people, goods, and scenes, enabled by three primary mechanisms: “novelty perception” (for category awareness), “exemplar projection” (for category scalability), and “structure shaping” (for category recognizability). The theoretical framework developed through this research contributes to the emergence of a new organizational category in the context of the digital economy, as well as offering practical guidance for the category strategy for venture growth in the digital entrepreneurial ecosystem.}

The results suggest the greater usefulness of certain network configuration strategies (e.g., collaboration, multi-sourcing) compared to others during catastrophic events. Our results indicate that SMEs can avoid suffering more harm than larger competitors by adopting strategies consisting of an adequate mix of proactive and reactive elements, and that an effective proactive strategy involves building flexibility by increasing the number of geographically spread supply chain partners, allowing for deeper discounts to preserve demand without hurting profits.}

It is indicated that digital finance enables rural revitalization mainly by promoting technological innovation, stimulating entrepreneurial activity, improving marketability and accelerating the accumulation of human capital. In addition, digital finance has a non-linear relationship with rural revitalization, which is influenced by various mediating mechanisms. The heterogeneity results indicate that the breadth and degree of digital finance contribute to rural revitalization.

Relational turbulence theory has recently gained traction in value chain literature in relation to the management of agency problems between partners within the sharing economy context; however, there is a surprising lack of agreement on the antecedents, benefits, risks, and boundary conditions of such relationships. To address this gap, we reviewed 52 peer-reviewed publications published between 2011 and 2021.

In the dynamic restaurant industry, we introduce "Genie," an AI-powered chatbot, represents an advancement in customer service efficiency through technological innovation. Designed to enhance restaurant operations including order processing, reservations, and FAQs management, Genie leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By converting input queries into word embeddings and applying a sophisticated tag classification system, Genie precisely interprets customer intents and generates accurate responses, thereby markedly improving the dining experience. Our thorough examination of various word embeddings and classifiers—Word2Vec, Glove, BERT, Gaussian Naive Bayes, XGB, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Recurrent Neural Networks—revealed that the combination of Word2Vec and ANN is the most effective, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 88.9 %. This discovery highlights Genie's capability to not only streamline restaurant operations but also enhance customer satisfaction by minimizing wait times and facilitating contactless service options. Additionally, this study enriches the understanding of AI's application in service industries and explores the potential future impact of generative AI technologies on chatbot interactions. As AI technology advances, its integration is essential for Genie to deliver increasingly personalized and dynamic customer experiences, aligning with the evolving demands of the digital era. This research emphasizes the transformative impact of AI in the restaurant industry, providing valuable insights into its practical applications and future prospects for automated customer service solutions.}

abstract = {In recent years, the manufacturing sector has been responsible for nearly 55 % of total energy consumption, inducing a major impact on the global ecosystem. Although technological advances are increasing its sustainability, zero-emission and fuel-efficient manufacturing is still considered a utopian target. Moreover, a primary feature of Industry 4.0 is the digitization of production processes, which offers the opportunity to optimize energy consumption. However, given the speed and often unpredictability with which innovation manifests itself, tools capable of measuring the impact that technology is having professions are still being designed. In light of the above, in this article we present the Worker Profiler, a software designed to map the skills currently possessed by workers, identifying misalignment with those they should ideally possess to meet the renewed demands that digital innovation and environmental preservation impose. In more detail, the authors inferred the key technologies and skills for the topic, isolating those with markedly increasing patent trends and identifying green and digital enabling skills and occupations. Thus, the software was designed and implemented at the user-interface level. The output of the self-assessment is the definition of the missing digital and green skills that enable the definition of a customized retraining strategy.}

Prior research has distinguished between two forms of customer involvement: customers as an information source (CIS) and customers as co-developers (CIC). We build on this stream of literature and investigate the impact of CIS and CIC on firms’ NPD performance in the digital context by considering both the benefits and costs of these two forms of customer involvement. Furthermore, we explore the moderating role of NPD stage. Based on survey data collected from 263 informants, we show that whereas CIS has a positive effect on NPD performance, CIC has an inverted U-shaped relationship with NPD performance. More interestingly, the positive relationship between CIS and NPD performance is more pronounced in the ideation stage than in the product development stage, and the inverted U-shaped relationship between CIC and NPD performance is steeper in the product development stage than that in the ideation stage. In our additional analyses, we further divide the NPD stage into four stages and found similar results as our main analyses. Our study enriches the customer involvement literature and offers practical implications regarding whether, how, and when to involve customers in the NPD process.}

abstract = {People create and share content via online social networks, which provide an unparalleled opportunity for brands to gain visibility, promote products or services and drive revenue growth. Much research has focused on why, how, or what social content is popular, trending and “hype”. One central challenge is to forecast the spread (cascades) of information that leads to the popularity of content throughout a social network. Online content tends to have bursts and spikes, experiencing a different cascading pattern depending on the viral propagation. In this paper, we propose and test a flexible framework capable of modelling such patterns and trends. We take temporal and network perspectives and develop a model based on the multivariate Hawkes processes that account for social behaviour and network elements such as follower counts, and activity variation observed in collective re-sharing behaviour. We focus on Twitter as the most widely used micro-blogging online social network and measure the popularity of a brand's tweet by analysing the time-series path of three types of subsequent activities (retweets (RTs), replies (REs) and likes (LKs)). The specific model that we propose in this paper is the multidimensional epidemic-type aftershock sequence (METAS) model, a particular case of the multivariate Hawkes process. It consists of a power-law relaxation governing the timing of activities. It also includes an exponential boost as a reinforcement mechanism for the response amplitude to model the impact of influential users on their followers. Earlier attempts to model online cascades have treated all online responses as one type of activity. Rather than aggregating all the activities into one stream, and therefore, ignoring exciting effects among different types of activities, we incorporate the activity variation into the predictive models of content popularity, explicitly accounting for such excitation effects. We develop epidemic-type mutually exciting Hawkes point processes models to quantify such effects and to predict more accurately the number of follow-up activities (i.e., RTs, REs and LKs) on a brand tweet after it is posted. Our results suggest that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of prediction accuracy, as it is able to account for mutual excitations and cross-interactions between sequences of users’ activities from one type to another. These results are relevant for developing and executing a plan for online activities by the brand owners.}

In this paper, a deep learning approach based on a hybrid fine-tuned Smith algorithm with Adam optimizer (HFS-AO) is proposed for multi-lingual opinion mining. The approach can process three different languages, namely Marathi, Hindi, and English, which are collected from various web resources using a web scraping algorithm. The collected data is annotated using the Zero-shot instance-weighting technique and pre-processed to remove unnecessary noises and symbols, including data transformation, data cleaning and reduction, stop-word removal, tokenization, lemmatization, stemming, and Parts of Speech Tagging (POS). Naive Bayes vectorization with Laplace smoothing is used for text vectorization, followed by feature selection and classification using the hybrid fine-tuned Smith algorithm with Adam optimizer for polarity classification. The proposed method of multi-lingual opinion mining using a deep learning approach based on a hybrid fine-tuned Smith algorithm with Adam optimizer is effective in extracting valuable insights from social media data in different languages. The approach has demonstrated high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score values, making it a useful tool for improving performance and customer satisfaction by identifying patterns and trends in public opinion. Additionally, the proposed method outperforms other existing methods, including PGM, MCM, CNN, and NBi-LSTM, in terms of computational time and performance making it a valuable contribution to the field of information management.}

Many industry leaders and managers believed industry/firm transformation is associated with the adoption of new technology, but although technologies often play a great role, they have never transformed a firm on their own. Consequently, this study re-actualizes the organizational architecture of digitization and its need for transformation. The discussion starts with a quick overview of the existing literature on organizational design, as well as its key advantages and disadvantages. The study adopted a hybrid approach in the form of a configuration approach and bibliometric methodologies viz. Citation Network Analysis (CNA) and Social Network Analysis (SNA). Based on the hybrid approach, the study identified various dimensions of organizational culture and structure for strategic entrepreneurial firms that deserve to be more careful consideration in digital transformation. The conclusions show that it is necessary to redesign the architecture of the incumbents so that they are ready to embrace the digital environment.}

In this research, we conducted a multiple case analysis with interviews and document data from four different types of manufacturing companies with open innovation enabled by digitalization capabilities, providing two key contributions to extant literature. First, resource integration is the bridge that connects digitalization capabilities with open innovation. Enterprises further empower open innovation by promoting the identification and acquisition of digital resources, resource matching and utilization through digitalization capabilities. Second, the process of digitalization capabilities enabling open innovation is closely linked to internal and external situational factors, with the environmental dynamics and the digital awareness of managers playing a catalytic role.

However, it contrasts with typical frameworks that promote the continued use of IT. Furthermore, it runs counter to the prevailing trend of digital transformation within organisations, which is expected to expand in the future. As a result, it challenges conventional approaches to IT usage and the associated contextual factors. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the concept of digital sobriety, examining its relationship to conventional approaches as well as the degrowth technology perspective. The study explores how digital sobriety is implemented within organisations and how it is perceived by IT users. Thirty-three participants from IT companies were included and the scope and characteristics of the phenomenon of digital sobriety were identified, including five levels of IT user maturity: refutation, inaction, substitution, optimisation, and disadoption/degrowth. The results highlight the need to balance the internal and external factors of digital sobriety and identify different trajectories of digital sobriety as socio-technical imaginaries for the future of IT.}

However, whether improving network infrastructure reduces urban-rural income inequality (URII) remains uncertain in the previous literature. Considering that URII is an important research issue in the field of social change, it is worthwhile to investigate the causal relationship between network infrastructure and URII. Based on the exogenous shock from a quasi-natural experiment of “Broadband China” demonstration cities, this paper utilizes a time-varying Difference-in-Differences (Time-varying DID) model to identify the causal impact of the improvement of network infrastructure on URII in China. The results show that: (1) After controlling the impact of other commonly acknowledged factors, network infrastructure remains a significant factor in URII reduction. (2) The mechanism analysis confirms that the mediating effect of digital financial inclusion plays a vital role in the impact of network infrastructure on URII. (3) Further regional heterogeneity analysis reveals that the impact of network infrastructure on reducing URII also relies on region's characteristics, such as geographical location, traditional infrastructure level, and administrative level. This paper has figured out the causal relationship between network infrastructure and URII, thus inspiring policy-makers who aim to reduce inequality between urban and rural areas to commit to improving network infrastructure with an emphasis on digital financial inclusion mechanism and comprehensive consideration of regional heterogeneity.}

The present study aims to review state-of-art literature on the application of IoT technology in the warehousing and logistics field and suggests a path for the future research through an in-depth analysis of studies done in this area. Sixty-four research articles were carefully selected after a thorough search of the Scopus and EBSCO databases, covering the period from January 2011 to 07th December 2021, to examine the applications of the IoT in the warehousing and logistics business. These articles were thoroughly reviewed and classified in terms of year-wise distribution, major publication outlets, types of study, and highly cited papers to understand the evolution and ongoing trends in this field. The findings reveal that majority of the studies on IoT in the warehousing and logistics domain have been conducted in developed countries. While logistics has been widely investigated, studies on the warehousing domain are limited. Also, there is an under-presentation of various theories in IoT research. The study highlights various gaps by synthesising existing literature and provides a fertile ground for conducting future research in this domain.

This study employs the dynamic capability theory to construct a theoretical framework termed the “learning capability model” to examine the influence of entrepreneurial learning on BMI. We collected questionnaires from 386 Internet startups and utilized hierarchical regression analysis to explore the impact of digital capabilities on these startups. We first identified two different types of entrepreneurial learning: exploratory learning and exploitative learning. Subsequently, we tested for their effects on BMI. The empirical results indicate that both exploratory and exploitative learning significantly impact BMI. However, exploitative learning exerts a greater influence than exploratory learning. These tests revealed that digital sensing capabilities, digital operational capabilities, and digital resource collaboration capabilities have a partial mediating effect on the relationship between entrepreneurial learning and BMI. Among these, digital operational capabilities exert the most significant mediating effect, while digital sensing capabilities exhibit weaker mediating effects. This study contributes to our understanding of digital capabilities and provides practical insights for Internet startups.}

The Metaverse is an all-encompassing, interconnected virtual environment where users can freely communicate with one another and digital content. This article examines how various technologies, primarily Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), have contributed to the development of the Metaverse (AR). These innovations have revolutionized the way we interact with digital media by enabling us to have genuine, realistic experiences. In addition, we examine the Metaverse technologies that make it possible to construct a fully realized, functional virtual world. Among these are recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), cryptocurrencies, spatial and peripheral computing, and other fields. Our research investigates the advantages and disadvantages of these technologies, as well as how they may influence the future of the Metaverse. Furthermore, the article explores the darker aspects of the Metaverse, particularly the emergence of the "dark verse," which underscores the potential for organized illicit activities within the Internet due to insufficient oversight and governance of the Metaverse.}

abstract = {Advances in machine learning and natural language processing have driven the growing popularity of virtual conversational agents (VCAs). This anthropomorphic communication approach relies on user information sharing and real-time feedback from VCAs, and has raised privacy concerns while affecting various social interactions and relationships. Previous research on reducing user privacy concerns has mainly focused on user information mining, sensitive user information requests and privacy policies, while little is known about the anthropomorphic roles of partners and servants at the human-machine social hierarchy level. Therefore, this study, based on human-computer interaction (service) anthropomorphism at social level, develops a framework to investigate the impact of information sensitivity and VCAs' anthropomorphic roles, including partner and servant, on users' privacy concerns, as well as the mediating effects of competence- and integrity-based trust. The results show that when highly sensitive information is requested, user privacy concerns are greater for a partner VCA than a servant VCA, and vice-versa. Meanwhile, when a VCA requests highly sensitive information, integrity-based trust mediates the relationship between servant VCAs and privacy concerns, and when a VCA requests low-sensitivity information, competence-based trust mediates the same relationship. These insights provide actionable implications for managers.}

The case study is optimized with an exact method, and a hybrid machine-learning algorithm solves large-scale numerical examples. The paper’s main contributions include movable manufacturers, uncertain parameters, a hybrid machine learning algorithm, and empirical data in the proposed decision-making model. The findings show that a moveable facility can substantially decrease total cost and carbon emissions. Sensitivity analysis shows that changes in moveable capacity and percent yield considerably impact the objectives. Findings show that decision-makers can achieve cost parity with fossil-based sources when employing circular supply chain management.}

This comparative study focuses on gamification platforms such as Ant Forest, and the valid data of 320 users and 238 non-users is assessed through partial least square structural equation modeling. Results unveil the significant role of value entrenched in gamified learning in perceptive mechanisms; nevertheless, substantial impacts of reasons for, reasons against, and sustainable purchasing attitude, including the moderating effect of perceived sustainable expertise, are distinctive between both samples. However, most of the hypotheses are supported. This study provides novel insights to comprehend the gamification avenue, which contains the potential to bolster sustainable purchasing and ultimately attain the objective of sustainable development.}

The results based on a sample of 236 traditional manufacturing firms show that there is a significant association between digital technology usage and business model innovation in which strategic flexibility plays a mediating role. The institutional environment has a dual role in this association: policy support strengthens the impact of digital technology usage on strategic flexibility, but regulatory turbulence weakens it.

Our findings show that (1) FDT can promote both GTI quantity and quality, but it is more significant for GTI quantity; (2) the positive effects can be obtained by reducing firm risk-taking and increasing R&D intensity; and (3) the role of FDT in promoting GTI is particularly significant in firms in the Midwest region, state-owned enterprises, and firms in high-tech sectors, but has negligible effect on high-polluting firms. Our conclusions remain robust after applying the Poisson model, excluding the effects of COVID-19, adopting the generalized method of moments instrumental variable regression, and using Sobel tests. The findings contribute to the literature by combining DOI and TOE into the same framework and empirically analyzing how FDT can influence GTI.}

After first identifying the service attributes from the literature, we calculate attribute performance via sentiment analysis. Second, guided by salience theory, factor importance is calculated based on the TF-IDF algorithm. Following the essential meaning of SWOT factors, we then construct the factor determination rules. Finally, we model the changing trends of SWOT factors from a dynamic perspective, which can help managers develop preventive strategies. Online reviews of five hotels crawled from Ctrip were applied to validate the proposed method. The comparison with two state-of-the-art methods also demonstrated its effectiveness.}

We analyze the idiosyncratic influences of firm size and locality on the DE–FP relationship. The findings, which are based on a sample of Chinese firms from 2016 to 2019, show that (a) the U-shaped DE–FP relationship applies to Chinese firms; (b) this relationship is moderate for large firms, substantially steeper for medium firms, and inverted for small firms; (c) the U-shaped DE–FP relationship for eastern region firms is moderate, while the U-shaped relationship for central region firms is steep, but the transition is incomplete, and western region firms have experienced increasing productivity since the early stage of DE development. This study offers an alternative approach to understanding Chinese firms' strategic choices in DE development and provides a more nuanced explanation for the productivity paradox by emphasizing the significance of the firm-specific context. In this way, the study captures the sophisticated and constantly evolving relationships between DE and FP for heterogeneous Chinese firms.}

The Industry 4.0 concept originated in manufacturing but has evolved over recent years and extended beyond the limits of the focal company to embrace the entire supply chain. This study applies a variety of techniques sequentially. First, the initial phases of a Systematic Literature Review are applied to identify, select, and evaluate documents for analysis. Subsequently, Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language Processing techniques are applied to identify research topics and group articles. Lastly, bibliometric analysis techniques are applied using an innovative tool that enables dynamic data association. A total of 41 research topics are identified that produce a grouping of 663 articles in 8 clusters. The obtained results are used for an analysis of the extant literature, the detection of gaps, and proposals to guide future research in the Industry 4.0 and supply chain sphere.}

Based on observation of, and interviews with, netizens in a large city in China, we suggest how the design and performance of digital disruption by Chinese netizens reflects the sociomaterial values that embody a collectivist sense of social harmony under China's state-controlled Social Credit System. This research is original in its use of actual user behavior, which we observed in a sample of Chinese netizens. We explain how these netizens created commercial opportunities on the internet by building and marketing their personal profiles. Yet our netizens demonstrated how this opportunity-seeking behavior nonetheless aligned with state rules for maintaining social harmony. The importance of our findings is in the apparent duality of behavior among our sample of netizens who presented their commercial activities as socially harmonious while seeking to build followers and earning income from their online activities. The study contributes to understanding this user behavior by suggesting how netizens may build substantial identities in one of the world's largest online communities that remains politically constrained. Implications for research and governance are suggested in understanding digital user behavior in and beyond China.}

abstract = {In the industry of video content providers such as VOD and IPTV, predicting the popularity of video contents in advance is critical, not only for marketing but also for network usage. By successfully predicting user preferences, contents can be optimally deployed among servers which ultimately leads to network cost reduction. Many previous studies have predicted view-counts for this purpose. However, they normally make predictions based on historical view-count data from users, given the assumption that contents are already published to users. This can be a downside for newly released contents, which inherently does not have historical data. To address the problem, this research proposes a hybrid machine learning approach for the popularity prediction of unpublished video contents. In this paper, we propose a framework which effectively predicts the popularity of video contents, via a combination of various methods. First, we divide the entire dataset into two types, according to the characteristics of the contents. Next, the popularity prediction is performed by either using XGBoost or neural net with category embedding, which helps resolving the sparsity of categorical variables and requiring the system to learn efficiently for the specified deep neural net model. In addition, we use the FTRL model to alleviate the volatility of view-counts. Experiments are carried out with a dataset from one of the top streaming service companies, and results display overall better performance compared to various standalone methods.}

Employing structural equation modeling (SEM), this study analyzed experimental survey data collected from 601 Indonesian Instagram users in August 2023. The findings reveal that eWOM valence positively affects consumer brand attitudes and perceived brand quality, subsequently driving online engagement and purchase intentions. The study challenges established relationships by demonstrating how brand attitude and perceived brand quality mediate the influence of eWOM valence. Additionally, this study highlights the critical moderating roles of eWOM credibility and influencer familiarity in strengthening the impact of eWOM valence. This research scrutinizes a context not widely explored in the current literature of eWOM studies by integrating these moderators and focusing on the dynamic interactions within social media platforms, providing new insights for digital marketers and social media influencers aiming to enhance consumer engagement and purchase intentions in the digital domain.}

abstract = {Short video platforms have become increasingly popular in recent years. Their success relies heavily on users’ continuous watching and advertising revenues. However, the factors that drive users’ continuous watching behavior are still unclear, and the potential influence of advertising on users’ continuous watching is largely neglected. Drawing upon the theory of consumption values (TCV) and the cognitive–affective–behavior (CAB) model, this study explores the factors influencing consumers’ continuous watching intentions from both cognitive and affective perspectives. We employed an exploratory mixed-methods study approach. Focus group discussions among 25 short video users were first conducted to identify five short video consumption values and develop the questionnaire. Then the survey was distributed to 584 short video users in China to obtain quantitative data for analysis using structural equation modeling. The results show that continuous watching intention is determined by affective factors of satisfaction and dependence, and affective factors are influenced by cognitive consumption values. Moreover, advertising irritation weakened the influence of satisfaction on continuous watching intention. Our study established and empirically verified a new cognitive and affective model to explain short video consumers’ behavior. The findings could help short video creators and platforms cultivate customers’ continuous watching by concentrating on the specific cognitive and affective factors, and provide guidance on balancing between users’ continuous watching and advertising revenue.}

In such a context, adopting information and digital technologies has become essential for district firms to innovate products and processes, effectively manage the relationships along the value chains, and achieve or sustain a competitive advantage. The adoption of digital technologies (DTs) requires district firms to have some specific enabling characteristics, which may depend on their interactions within the district environment and which are still a matter of debate. To increase knowledge on this topic, the present research investigates the path that enables district firms' technology adoption processes by examining how cognitive and affective trust relate to tacit knowledge sharing, which, in turn, affects the technological and organizational factors determining DT adoption. Through structural equation modeling, the results of a survey study on footwear district firms highlight that cognitive trust—but not affective trust—influences both the technological and organizational factors through tacit knowledge sharing.

Among the most complex model scenarios, a framework based on a Traffic Identification System (TIS) is a crucial answer. The Web-based brute force and botnet attacks are linked in this initial phase. To forecast the samples using the adaptive bootstrap method, the second phase entails creating a classifier on the training dataset. The normalization model and features are combined in the model, which then identifies traffic attacks on the network. Based on voting mechanisms from several decision trees utilized in the mode, an ensemble model using the Adaptive Boosting Classifier and Random Forest Algorithm (ABC-RFA) method is employed to construct the classification model. According to the overhead analysis of the dataset used for testing, the suggested model's overall performance is approximately 98.90 %, much better than the conventional models currently in use.

We outline three AI-powered capabilities (AI-enabled automation, AI-enabled analytics, and AI-enabled relational capabilities) as ARMC’s predictors. We posit that the strengths of these relationships depend on environmental hostility and dynamism. Additionally, we propose positive associations between ARMC and three organizational outcomes: firm performance, process innovation, and product innovation. Our research employs a two-stage design, surveying IT and business executives from firms that have adopted AI. The results demonstrate significant interaction effects of environmental hostility and dynamism on the relationships between AI-powered capabilities and ARMC.

The data was collected through an online survey conducted among Klang Valley residents. Stratified random sampling was used to gather the data and structural equation modelling (SEM) was applied for the data analysis. The findings revealed that perceived value is a significant predictor of the intention to adopt digital-only banks. Furthermore, perceived convenience, economic efficiency, functional risk, trust, and environmental concern determined the perceived value of digital-only banks. However, security risk, critical mass, and number of services were non-significant predictors of perceived value. Notably, perceived value plays a significant mediating role between certain determinants and adoption intention. This research adds value by revealing multifaceted determinants of perceived value and incorporating environmental concern that highlights the significance of green perceived value in shaping adoption intention. Furthermore, it provides empirical results on a research gap related to digital-only banks' perceived value mediating effect on the intention to adopt these banks. Finally, the study can assist the practitioners of digital-only banks in attracting and retaining users in this modern competitive banking and financial market.}

A questionnaire has been applied and a sample of 329 workers was obtained, from which it has been possible to conclude, that in cases where there is a good working environment, they feel more comfortable talking to people than to robots, and vice versa when the working environment is bad. Moreover, it is concluded that when workers trust their human resources (HR) departments, they prefer to deal with people regarding a problem such as bullying and that when they trust AI systems, there is a greater preference to interact with robots than when they do not trust them.}

abstract = {The airline industry has a wide range of customers with different tastes and expectations of airline services. Therefore, knowing the different attitudes of customers and consequently addressing their opinions is paramount in this business. Airlines offer different flight classes to customers to provide passenger transportation services and use different methods to evaluate customer satisfaction. One of the methods used to analyze customer opinions is the use of text analysis with machine learning techniques. In this study, to analyze the textual data, we used topic modeling to identify passengers' attitudes. In the first stage, we evaluated the performance of three different topic modeling methods: Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP), and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). As a result of the modeling process, LDA had the best performance with an average coherence value of 0.42. Eventually, after determining the optimum number of topics as 10 topics, the prominent topics were interpreted and explained. The results of this study demonstrate the common and distinct attitudes of customers of economy class, business class, and first class. As appeared in the results of the economy flight class, the most important topic that appeared in comments was "passenger care". However, in whole reviews and reviews of business and first flight classes, the topic of "time" was more repetitive. Given the wide application of the presented methodology, the findings of this research can provide airline managers with a broader insight into passenger preferences and guide them on how to provide quality service for their customers.}

We develop a model that includes both conversion incidence and selling duration, thus accounting for the correlation between the variables. The proposed model is calibrated using data on one million randomly selected used cars traded in an online marketplace. The results reveal that search ads increase conversion probability significantly, by a remarkable 65.26%, and shorten selling duration by 3.51 days, on average. The effect on conversion probability is greater for new (individual) advertisers than it is for their regular (business) counterparts. By contrast, the shortened selling duration is more pronounced for regular (individual) advertisers than it is for new (business) advertisers. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for marketplace sellers and platform companies.}

In doing so, this study argues that co-production, even in its simplest form, constitutes a three-pronged interaction. It is argued that trying to understand the process solely from the customer's perspective is insufficient without considering the qualities of the co-production partner and the factors related to the co-produced offering. Therefore, this study examines factors linked to the customer (travelers who have completed online check-in), the company (the airline), and the co-produced offering (the online check-in experience). Furthermore, customers' tangible resources have been included in the study to understand the effect of operand resources on the process. The results of 1095 questionnaires suggest that antecedents related to the co-produced offering and co-production partner are even stronger determinants than those of customers. Moreover, when forming attitudes towards co-production in an airline setting through self-check-in, operand resources of the customer, which have been overlooked in empirical studies, emerge as the predominant factor.}

However, further attention needs to be given to the external technological opportunities that also contribute to value creation in firms. We applied unsupervised machine learning techniques, particularly DBSCAN, in an attempt to generate a macro-level technological map. Our results show that AI and machine learning tools can indeed be used for these purposes, and DBSCAN is a potential algorithm.

The analysis first reveals that Industry 4.0 involvement has internal and external knowledge-based ramifications, including more productivity and enhanced communication. Second, organisational knowledge is based on proactiveness and reaching within/out, predominantly through training, organisational support, and external experts. Third, organisational knowledge supports Industry 4.0 implementation primarily by taking charge internally and externally, that is, increasing the understanding of Industry 4.0, and by focusing on ‘human-assisted applicability’ or the human touch.

Based on data from Chinese A-share listed corporations between 2008 and 2020, the study investigates the relationship between digital transformation and resource reallocation. The findings indicate that digital transformation significantly enhances the allocation efficiency of capital and labor. Specifically, doubling the frequency of digital transformation terms can correct capital input deviation by approximately 9.5 % and labor input deviation by around 7.3 %. The enhancement primarily stems from mitigating excessive input inefficiencies, while demonstrating insignificant effects on underinvestment scenarios. Moreover, these results are consistent across an array of robustness tests, including Bartik IV and difference-in-differences strategy using the “Broadband China” policy as a quasi-natural experiment. Mechanism analysis reveals that alleviating external information frictions and enhancing internal information utilization constitute the primary channels through which digital transformation fosters resource allocation efficiency. Furthermore, digital transformation not only raises the overall total factor productivity (TFP) through resource reallocation but also directly fosters the growth of corporate TFP.}

The automotive industry's technological innovations, promoted by governments, may not have the environmental impact desired in certain regions. To address this issue, a survey was conducted in the city of Madrid. An exploratory factor analysis, followed by a discriminant analysis, was used to validate the constructs and predict the decision-making. The results confirm that the policies adopted by regulators generate uncertainty among individuals regarding which vehicle to purchase. As such, the purchase of a new vehicle may be postponed. This has the opposite effect that is intended, since a delay in the decision to purchase a new vehicle increases the average age of the vehicle fleet, thus contributing to more pollution from the mobility environment. These results highlight the need for governments to work on policies that align environmental needs with the social and economic context in order to achieve the most efficient transition possible, and an global discussion on the technology and innovation applied to consolidate sustainable mobility.}

abstract = {In this research, we analyze and map the existing literature on ‘green’ in the disciplines of management and business by applying citation, co-citation, and bibliographic coupling analyses, i.e. using bibliometric methods, from two different perspectives: first, identifying and analyzing the works that have had the greatest impact on research and the changes that have taken place in the intellectual structure of this disciplinary area; and second, reviewing the most recent literature to unveil current trends and future priorities as they are reflected at the forefront of research. To carry out the study we used Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science Core Collection™ (WoS) –in particular, one of its indexes: the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI). From this database, 4,888 articles published between 1968 and 2022 were retrieved. The sample period of 55 years was then divided into two sub-periods: 1968–2011 and 2012–2022 to longitudinally examine the data. To the best of our knowledge, no such study has dealt with this field and we believe the outcomes can help coordinate future research efforts.}

abstract = {As digital connectivity continues to unlock new ways to interconnect activities from heterogeneous organisations, our need to understand how actors exercise control over these interdependencies to innovate the ecosystem becomes an imperative. This study proposes a conceptual framework building on a new construct – the ecosystem business model – to specify actors' roles based on the functional activities they manage and their structural positions, and explain why different roles drive innovation in the ecosystem's joint value proposition at different intensities. These arguments are illustrated with two cases of digitally enabled ecosystems from the air transport and healthcare sectors with different connectivity governance rules. This paper contributes to the ecosystem literature by explaining the mechanisms through which governance structures and innovation dynamics interact, providing a new explanation of ecosystem evolution that is compatible with contemporary digital connectivity trends. The framework also serves as a guiding tool for practitioners to map out actor roles and the degree in which they can potentially drive innovation in the ecosystem's value proposition.}

By facilitating seamless communication between objects and the internet, IoT catalyzes unprecedented connectivity between machines and objects. An inherent advantage lies in its capacity to facilitate real-time information sharing, enabling efficient management of vital aspects within the realm of supply chain management, including inventory, products, and orders. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of IoT on supply chain performance, with a specific focus on the mediating role of interconnected systems in the dynamics of supply and demand, and the performance of supply chain firms within a sustainable circular economy context. A survey involving 268 manufacturers forms the basis of quantitative data analysis. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was employed to test the relationships between latent and construct factors. The results highlight the significant influence of IoT capabilities on both supply chain performance and the integration of internet-enabled supply and demand processes. Concurrently, the study reveals a reciprocal positive effect, as supply and demand integration within internet-enabled supply chains contributes to enhanced supply chain performance. Moreover, the integration of internet-enabled supply and demand processes emerges as a crucial mediator, amplifying the relationship between IoT capabilities and supply chain performance. This study provides valuable insights for managers, researchers, and policymakers, fostering a deeper understanding of the vital role that IoT plays in cultivating and enhancing superior supply chain management practices and overall performance. The study highlights the significant benefits of IoT in enhancing supply chain performance through improved real-time tracking, inventory management, and resource optimization. It also emphasizes the crucial role of integrating internet-enabled supply and demand processes as a mediator, boosting overall supply chain efficiency and responsiveness.}

abstract = {Innovation is regarded as a critical asset for organisations. Nevertheless, existing research indicates that firms frequently engage in superficial or theatrical activities when attempting to develop technology-based innovations. Some critics argue that technology-based innovation has become a buzzword or part of organisational hypocrite. This phenomenon is referred to as ‘innovation theatre’. This creates a tension between the growing willingness to innovate and the reasons and methods by which organisations engage in theatre, which has received little attention in the literature. We investigate how and why innovation theater occurs using an inductive approach and the theoretical lenses of symbolic actions. We theorize that organisations theatralise technology-based innovation by engaging in hybrid and internal symbolic activities that have no impact on the innovation process but are highly visible to communicate and legitimise organisations in the face of external pressures to innovate. We found that this is caused by hard, soft, and legitimacy drivers. Our study contributes to the literature by expanding our understanding of an overlooked phenomenon, introducing a model that explains why and how it occurs and connecting the symbolic action literature with technology-based innovation, which opens the door for future research. It also has significant implications for how companies could handle the issue at hand.}

Due to the growing attention to service innovation in recent years, this study investigates the phenomenon of service innovation in greater depth to understand how service innovation has emerged, evolved, and how it will potentially advance. Considering a systematic investigation, the foundational research areas and historical development of service innovation are explored by conducting a comprehensive performance analysis (qualitative and quantitative) employing 255 articles published in two periods between 1970 and 2021. The results revealed four distinguishable clusters with each showing different characteristics of the service innovation domain including: resource focus, process focus, solution focus, and actors’ focus. In particular, we analyse which research streams are related to service innovation and compare these themes over time. The findings show that the major themes in the first period (1992–2014) included innovation, customer, service, and product, while the second period (2014–2021) encompassed service, customer, value, and information as the main themes. This paper supports the assertion that service innovation has an interdisciplinary theoretical foundation and that the structure of the foundation of service innovation research changed significantly over time.}

However, meager researchers have studied CX in AI-enabled products. Utilizing qualitative and quantitative methods, this study developed a scale of CX in AI-enabled products using Churchill's (1979) scale development framework. The scale underwent several stages of development including item generation, scale purification, scale validation, cross-testing, and nomological validity testing. Finally, five dimensions were identified to represent CX in AI-enabled products, such as data capture experience, classification experience, delegation experience, social experience, and anthropomorphic experience. Based on assemblage theory, the study develops the scale from the perspective of integrating human-centric and object-oriented anthropomorphic metaphors. Establishment of this scale extends traditional CX research, expands emerging CX research, and presents the first operationalized definition of the CX in AI-enabled products. The development of this scale provides a framework for marketers to enhance the CX in emerging consumer environments.}

Using the system generalized method of moments (SYS-GMM) method combined with the theory of industrial clusters, the contribution of digital technology application, green supply chain management, consumer behaviour, and corporate social responsibility to synergistic development is analyzed. It is found that the highly clustered wholesale and retail industry has promoted supply chain intelligence and logistics optimization through the extensive application of digital technology, creating favourable conditions for synergistic development. Regarding green supply chain management, cluster companies are more inclined to adopt green measures such as environmentally friendly packaging and energy-efficient logistics, effectively reducing carbon emission levels. In terms of consumer behaviour, the increase in the clustering rate has prompted consumers to be more inclined to consume green and purchase green products, thus promoting the decarbonization of products and services. CSR practices show that highly clustered companies are more active in implementing emission reduction measures, reflecting their responsibility for sustainable development. This study provides a new theoretical perspective for understanding the intrinsic mechanism of industrial clusters in carbon emission reduction and offers feasible carbon reduction strategies for industrial practices. In the urgent global carbon emission reduction context, this study provides essential academic and practical value for promoting China's wholesale and retail industry toward more sustainable development.}

We also investigate the mediating roles of organisational agility, ESM infrastructure and knowledge sharing on the relationship between ESM usage and decision-making effectiveness. To empirically test this model, data was collected through a survey from the employees of public/private emergency and disaster management organisations during COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. The results confirm that ESM usage indirectly affects decision-making effectiveness, which ultimately improves organisations’ operational and social performance. Organisational agility and ESM infrastructure are strong mediators of the link between ESM usage and decision-making effectiveness, while the mediating effect of knowledge sharing through ESM is weaker. In addition to presenting theoretical rationale and empirical evidence, the study enables us to outline policy guidelines for social media managers of disaster management organisations, who must develop ESM strategies in order to boost operational and social performance. This study makes a preliminary attempt to empirically investigate ESM's innovative usage in emergency and disaster management situations.}

The paper adopts a deep neural network-based prediction model for conducting sentiment analysis on heterogeneous datasets. We construct a sentiment simulation model of voluntary disclosures to know whether the managers can use the market sentiment as a strategic input to boost market performance by suitably drafting the tone and content of disclosures without compromising their quality and veracity. The Deep Neural Networks with LSTM algorithm is found to outperform the Deep Neural Networks with RNN and other baseline machine learning classifiers in terms of predictive accuracy of the NSE NIFTY50.

abstract = {The servitization transformation is an important strategic planning and development trend for Chinese small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in manufacturing to break through the low-end locking of the global value chain and achieve high-quality transformation and upgrading. Digital transformation is a new expansion and the main focus of technology and service innovation in the process of enterprise servitization. To comprehensively evaluate the development status of Chinese manufacturing enterprises’ servitization level and explore the heterogeneity effect of digital transformation on enterprise servitization level, this study conducts the following research. By analyzing the influencing factors of manufacturing SMEs’ servitization level and the mechanism of digital transformation, this study combines the panel data of SMEs in manufacturing from 2015 to 2020 and evaluates their servitization levels from static and dynamic perspectives using super-efficiency data envelopment analysis (DEA) and Malmquist index methods. Furthermore, this study examines the influence of digital transformation on the servitization level of SMEs in manufacturing by using a digital input index and scenario comparison and analyzes the heterogeneous effects according to industry type. The results show that the servitization level of Chinese SMEs in manufacturing is not high, and its development is not balanced. Digital transformation plays a significant role in promoting the servitization of SMEs in manufacturing. The effect has obvious heterogeneity owing to differences in industry type. The research results can provide countermeasures and suggestions for the digitalization and servitization innovation development of SMEs in manufacturing, which can promote high-quality transformation and upgrading of Chinese SMEs in manufacturing and increase their position in the global value chain.}

Despite voluminous research on the causes of social network exhaustion and privacy invasion, limited academic attention has been devoted to understanding the driving forces and contributing factors for discontinuing usage of smartphone app. Drawing on the cognition-affect-conation paradigm, the present research proposes a conceptual research model to examine how information overload and communication overload effect social network exhaustion, privacy invasion, and ultimately, smartphone app users' intentions to discontinue usage. The study evaluates data from 442 smartphone app users, employing statistical analyses to demonstrate that both information overload and communication overload significantly impact users' exhaustion and privacy invasion. Additionally, social network exhaustion and privacy invasion are two major predictors of smartphone app discontinuance intention. By identifying the influential factors and causes of younger generations' discontinuous usage intention of smartphone app, this study meets the need for a thorough assessment of the social network exhaustion and privacy invasion phenomena. The findings may potentially enhance comprehension of the discontinuation intention phenomenon in the context of cognitive overload. Furthermore, they may provide novel insights for practitioners regarding effective strategies conducive to managing mobile social network adoption behavior, as well as the preservation of engagement levels among young users in mobile-saturated societies.}

In addition, there has been a lack of theoretical insight into how digital servitization can act as a trigger to enable the flourishing of green innovation in product service systems (PSS). The traditional view on dynamic capabilities may not suitably adapt to the challenges and chances presented by rapidly changing digital environments that are necessary for pursuing green innovation. Consequently, we examined the central role of digital servitization in improving green innovation, commencing with an analysis of the absorptive capacity to adapt to rapidly changing systems while considering the moderating role of transformative capacity. This study obtained and analyzed 482 Korean firms adopting PSS through the structural equation method. The research results reveal a mechanism for improving a green innovation capability based on digital servitization and provide practical implications for firms and stakeholders. Theoretically, we contribute to the literature by unveiling the relationship between firms' dynamic capabilities and green innovation performance. Various interconnections were considered to comprehend a firm's digital servitization strategy. As managerial implications, we recommend that PSS firms closely focus on adjusting their strategy to suit the rapidly evolving digital landscape.}

Drawing on dynamic capabilities’ theory, our study examines the role of service innovation and organizational resilience in enhancing business performance using a sequential two-stage mixed-methods approach. First, a quantitative study was conducted to test the proposed research model using structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis with a sample of 343 service companies in Spain. Second, a qualitative analysis was performed with 12 interviews with managers to provide additional insights and a detailed understanding of the phenomenon. The results confirm innovation and resilience as key dynamic capabilities to address a changing business landscape and remain competitive. Our findings also reveal the strategic importance of digital tools (social media platforms) and external networks as drivers of service innovation. Managers can use these findings to leverage social media to engage in collaborative networks, enhance innovation and resilience, and succeed in turbulent markets.}

Specifically, to improve price markdown policies for fashion apparel retailers, we uncover the relationship between fashion product characteristics and consumers’ within-season product adoption behavior. We develop an aggregate demand model and estimate it using a finite mixture model on data from a leading specialty apparel retailer. The demand model identifies two latent classes of products based on the evolution of demand within a product’s lifecycle (i.e., sharply deteriorating vs. stable demand), and accounts for unobserved heterogeneity where mixing probabilities are defined as functions of fashion product attributes. We then run hundreds of counterfactuals to evaluate pricing policies in terms of: (1) timing and (2) depth of price markdowns. Our findings show that the retailer should implement middle-of-the-season price markdowns for products that have high initial prices, are introduced in the summer/fall, or are darker in colors. For other products, markdowns should be shallower and earlier in the season. We show that ignoring the cross-product heterogeneity in within-season demand could result in a 5.77% reduction in revenues. Our solutions provide managerial implications and enable the retailer to predict products’ demand patterns prior to launching products in the market.}

This study assumes a value chain perspective to analyze the evolutionary trajectories of manufacturing companies. We developed a Delphi-based scenario analysis involving 76 experts from academia and practice. The results highlight the most common expectations as well as controversial issues in terms of emerging business models, size, barriers to entry, vertical integration, rent distribution, and geographical location of activities. Eight scenarios provide a concise outlook on the range of possible futures. These scenarios are based on four main drivers which stem from the experts’ comments: demand characteristics, transparency of data among value chain participants, maturity of additive manufacturing and advanced robotics, and penetration of smart products. Researchers can derive from our study a series of hypotheses and opportunities for future research on Industry 4.0.

Our research encompasses two studies that address this limitation and establish a framework for business-model archetypes in the context of AIoT data ecosystems. In the first study, exploratory qualitative research on 28 leading AIoT data ecosystem actors leads to the identification of value propositions and value-capture mechanisms in these ecosystems. We identify eight possible value propositions and eight possible value-capture mechanisms. The second, qualitative study centers on 19 expert interviews. Our analysis leads to the identification of two dimensions – control and customization – that guide the conceptualization and formation of business-model archetypes. Using these dimensions, we develop a framework for business-model archetypes in AIoT data ecosystems.

abstract = {In social networks or, more specifically, online communities on tech-products, opinion leaders are important sources of advice for other consumers in the adoption and diffusion of new products. However, possibilities for potential users to exert their influence on opinion leadership are ignored. This study determines whether and how lead users may serve as opinion leaders in social networks and advise other consumers in the adoption and diffusion of new products. Our survey with 308 users in the Xiaomi and Huawei communities suggests that higher lead userness is positively and significantly associated with the likelihood of opinion giving and passing. Product-possessing innovativeness has a higher impact compared with information-possessing innovativeness. Product involvement does not enhance the effect of information-possessing innovativeness. The findings provide a better understanding of the formation of opinion leadership in social networks for an accelerated diffusion of new products.}

Therefore, using CiteSpace software, we conduct bibliometric analyses, unveiling this field's dynamic trends in collaboration, co-citation, and co-occurrence evolution. We find that there has been a consistent uptrend in publications in this field since 2013, covering diverse disciplines; besides, European institutions are forerunners in cooperation, and different regions have different collaboration priorities in topics; in addition, the most co-cited author is not the most influential, but the highly cited journals usually have a high impact; furthermore, future research will likely focus on the tourist experience and satisfaction and their pro-environmental behaviors. Compared with previous relevant studies, this paper is innovative as we comprehensively and multidimensionally view the evolution of sustainable tourism research, establish a new knowledge framework to depict the primary ideas of this field, and pinpoint the current challenges and future characteristics of research, which is theme-specific, clear and easy to understand this field's dynamic evolution, and instructive for future research and practice.}

There is a need of effective solutions to support digital transformation of manual approach in which it can expedite and enhance the accuracy of cost estimation by automating specific tasks and streamlining decision processes. Although a number of studies have been done to enhance the performance of forecasting models, little research has been done to address the interrelations between cost estimation model and the associated decisions for quotation. Focusing on realistic needs, this study aims to develop a digital cost estimation system by integrating data-driven methodologies, search engines, and rule-based decision mechanism based on domain knowledge for improving the accuracy of cost estimation and the effectiveness of quotation for revenue management. An empirical study was conducted in a global aerospace manufacturer in Taiwan for validation. The results have shown the practical viability for the proposed framework with better performance than conventional approaches. The developed solution has been implemented.}

The following conclusions are obtained. Firstly, the relationship between digital technology and cultural resources and their impact on the innovation of cultural industries is found to be nonlinear, which is a dynamic evolution process. Secondly, the impact of cultural resources on cultural industry innovation is not completely positively correlated, and the impact on technological innovation is more like an inverted U-shaped curve with a rising, peak, and declining period; the impact on content innovation, meanwhile, is similar to the ferment and take-off stages in the S-curve of innovation. And digital technology plays a significant role in promoting innovation, and is, especially in technological innovation, more like an ascending step from quantitative changes to qualitative change. Thirdly, digital technology and cultural resources are found to play different roles in the different stages of innovative development. Cultural resources are the basic factor and digital technology is the incentive factor.}

Clarifying the impact and mechanism of digital transformation on enterprise pollution reduction has important policy implications for the synergistic development of digitalization and greenization. This paper explores the impact of digital transformation on enterprise pollution abatement using data from Chinese manufacturing enterprises and fixed effects models. The empirical results show that digital transformation contributes to enterprise pollution reduction. Furthermore, the pollution reduction role of digital transformation is more pronounced in enterprises with high degrees of pollution intensity. Digital transformation acts on pollution reduction through productivity improvement and scale expansion, while a mechanism for green technology innovation does not exist. Additionally, industry attributes and external environment heterogeneity affect the pollution abatement role of digital transformation. Enterprises can achieve stronger pollution abatement from digital transformation when they belong to high-polluting industries, high-tech industries, areas with high environmental regulation (HER), and cohorts. The paper provides new micro evidence that digital transformation promotes pollution reduction, enriches the literature on the environmental impact of digital transformation, and provides beneficial insights for enterprises to drive pollution reduction in the era of the digital economy.}

It was conducted to fill a literature gap on multi-stakeholder perspectives on the use of in-room service robots. Using a variety of data collection methods including a survey and interviews, the perspectives of stakeholder groups were found to be dissimilar. Hotel guests perceived more benefits than expenses while management views were more focused on the costs and technical aspects. Managers and financial officers primarily had a return on investment perspective on hotel robot use. The negative attitudes held by hotel managers toward service robots were related to costs of implementation and a concern that these costs could not be recouped. The technology readiness index, service robot acceptance model, and technology organization environment (TOE) framework were applied to examine guest perceptions and adoption attitudes.}

Most studies on labour polarisation use employment data to track changes in labour demand and incomes across routine and non-routine jobs. In this paper we utilise a database of online job postings published on Polish websites in the period 2017–2019 to map skills the requirements in respective task-content groups. We observe little evidence of job polarisation in the Polish vacancy market, with cognitive, communication, availability, technical, and self-organisation skills being in high demand regardless of the task-content group. With the use of logistic regression we find that non-routine and routine cognitive jobs require a quite extensive, and similar skill-mix. Multinomial logistic results show that communication and cognitive skills enhance the employability in non-routine and routine cognitive jobs, while in the case of non-routine manual jobs these are availability, mathematical and interpersonal skills. Based on these findings, we conclude that the lifelong learning system should focus on developing the transversal skills required in jobs resilient to automation (non-routine jobs). Moreover, we argue that enhancing the transition from routine to non-routine jobs by providing the required transversal skills plays and important role in reducing social inequalities.}

The results indicate that digital transformation has significantly improved CEP. The evidence remains valid after a series of robustness tests, including replacing core variables, eliminating the impact of external major events, improving sample quality and instrumental variable regression. Mechanism verification shows that Digital transformation (DT) enhances CEP through ‘green technology upgrading’, ‘increasing external media attention’ and ‘enhancing internal management control’ effects. Heterogeneity analysis shows that DT has a more significant positive impact on non-private, industry technology-intensive, high regional environmental regulation, high energy consumption and high emission CEP, Internet business models are less conducive to improving corporate environmental performance than other digital technologies. Further tests show that resource reallocation improves the industry’s environmental performance and is an important channel for DT to play a catalytic role.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been experiencing rapid progress in the last few years, and it is becoming an important tool to address the impact and challenges of an aging population. Therefore, this research introduces population aging and artificial intelligence into agricultural production, focusing on the effects of population aging on food security and the function played by artificial intelligence in it. From an empirical study conducted based on provincial panel data, the following conclusions arise. First, population aging in rural China has not negatively impacted food security, so there is no need to be overly pessimistic about the inevitable aging of the rural population. Second, AI has a favorable moderating function on the effects of population aging on food security. Third, the moderating effect of AI is heterogeneous. Compared with other provinces, AI can play a strongly positive moderating effect in central and west regions and major grain-selling areas. Based on the above findings, this paper proposes targeted policy recommendations on protecting food security in the context of artificial intelligence and population aging.}

In particular, the emergence of generative AI, exemplified by large language models such as ChatGPT, has been marked by substantial media attention, discourse, and hype. Like most, if not all, aspects of business, innovation processes have been impacted. However, little is known about the degree of impact or the benefits that might be gained. To cut through the hype and understand the use of AI in innovation processes in businesses today, a large-scale survey amongst innovation managers in the USA was conducted, followed by interviews. The findings indicate that the use of AI in innovation processes is high and widespread, with AI being used for more than half of the surveyed firms' innovation projects. Furthermore, AI is used more in the development stage of the innovation process than in the idea or commercialization stages, which counters much of the existing discourse, which focuses on the idea stage. We uncover interesting differences by comparing the use and impact of generative AI with that of more traditional AI. Among these is a significant difference in expected benefits in making employees’ jobs more fulfilling — managers believe generative AI is more likely to confer this benefit than traditional AI. This paper offers two valuable contributions. First, it enriches the evolving dialogue at the intersection of AI and innovation management by offering much-needed empirical evidence about practical applications. Second, it provides timely managerial implications by examining relationships between the use of AI and innovation performance and understanding the benefits that AI can confer in the innovation process.}

To organize the relevant research on AI and cross-cultural second language acquisition, a literature review is conducted. The advantages and disadvantages of the present training mechanism were then systematically summarized by evaluating the current situation of CIT training in news communication. Subsequently, the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) model was applied to ameliorate the CIT training strategy for news dissemination. The analysis of the CIT talent training strategy for news communication demonstrates that the number of talents predicted by the model remained optimal through the model's iteration over six data lists. The RBFNN model proposed herein also outperforms other models with two experimental data sets. The model registers a recognition accuracy of 70 % and precision of 80 % at the 100th iteration. The recognition accuracy and precision improves significantly to 82.3 % and 83.6 %, respectively, after the 600th iteration. This study can further enhance the effects of CIT training in news communication and can serve as a reference for the digital intelligence of the news communication industry.}

Among various social media channels, Twitter provides an efficient platform for researchers and politicians to explore public opinion regarding a wide range of topics such as the economy and foreign policy. Current literature mainly focuses on analyzing the content of tweets without considering the gender of users. This research collects and analyzes a large number of tweets and uses computational, human coding, and statistical analyses to identify topics in more than 300,000 tweets posted during the 2020 U.S. presidential election and to compare female and male users regarding the average weight of the discussed topics. Our findings are based upon a wide range of topics, such as tax, climate change, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Out of the topics, there exists a significant difference between female and male users for more than 70% of topics.}

I4.0 involves the digital turn of manufacturing companies, changing the way they operate, their business models, and by extension, their interaction with digital players. Nonetheless, the future of I4.0 regarding its interaction with digital players and the phenomenon of uberization has scarcely been examined. Thus, this research adopts a participatory and systemic foresight approach to explore the trajectories of I4.0 in the face of uberization. The study was conducted with a working group of 22 members from academia and practice. Four scenarios and related action plans were produced. The results emphasize that uberization is not necessarily a process to be endured by manufacturers, but it could be chosen or even co-constructed with different actors if manufacturers address key challenges such as rethinking their business models and adapting their factors of production. The scenarios indicate the dynamics of uberization as contingent on technological developments and on industrial policy choices, changes in consumer behavior, and access to multiple funding sources. Finally, the study provides practical implications regarding the dynamics of collaboration between SMEs and large groups, on one hand, and between manufacturing companies and digital players, on the other hand.}

This study examines the dual effects of a digital orientation and a corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) orientation on firm innovation under firm resource constraints. The empirical results confirm the hypothesis that digitization and ESG practices promote corporate innovation. In addition, a combined effect of ESG and digitization strategies on innovation performance is confirmed, but this effect is substitutive for resource-constrained enterprises, such as those with high levels of financing constraints and small and medium-sized enterprises. The role in supporting or hindering the synergy between digitalization and ESG strategies in different regions and industry sectors may various. Enterprises should prudently implement a dual strategy encompassing both digitalization and ESG while fully considering the inherent interaction of the two to improve the level of strategic synergy.}

A recent surge in business investments in digital technologies-based training applications is witnessed. Metaverse is a technology in training and development landscape that intends to materialize a highly immersive experience by combining the virtual and the real world. Organizations are moving towards a metaverse environment to enhance the interactivity and flexibility of training while maintaining a high quality of their educational content and training plans. However, the existing scholarly work on metaverse tends to be more focused on employees' recruitment and retention functions of human resource, while the training and development function, particularly, the employees' training experience of the metaverse, is largely overlooked. Understanding employees' experiences is critical for businesses to achieve the desired training outcomes. Our study aims to fill this research gap by adopting a novel structural topic model text analysis method to analyze 889 employees' reviews about various training applications in metaverse environment. Specifically, we explored the employees' reviews of leading training platforms STRIVR, Spatial Computing, Mursion, Program ACE, Rewo, Gather, and ARKit. Our initial results reveal 9 topics, of which 5 relate to positive aspects and 4 are potential concerns. In particular, real-time collaboration, enhanced practicality, alignment with technology training, real-time feedback analytics, and customizable learning environments are positive, whereas accessibility and inclusivity, ethical considerations, privacy and security concerns, and cultural resistance are negative aspects. This study highlights the promising potential of the metaverse in improving the training and development functions within human resource management. By leveraging the novel efficiencies that the metaverse confers, firms can use these advancements to gain a competitive advantage.}

Our findings suggest that socio-psychological gratification variables (perceived homophily, perceived critical mass, and self-status seeking) drive consumers’ engagement with brand pages and brand communities on social media. This relationship is strengthened by the consumer values. These insights serve as an important basis for researchers and practitioners to understand social media brand engagement and its outcomes.}

However, little is known about the adoption of digital technologies in manufacturing firms at a supply chain level. This paper aims to understand why and how manufacturing firms adopt digital technologies, and the impact of the adoption on supply chains. The study uses literature review method, identifies the main drivers of manufacturing firms adopting digital technologies (why), develops a new model of the adoption process (how), and synthesizes the impact of the adoption on supply chains into four aspects (what): supply chain efficiency, supply chain structure, sustainability and innovation. The paper then proposes a conceptual framework consisting of driver, process and impact, and discusses their inter-relationships. The study identifies that the technological intelligence and supply chain cooperation are two important factors and proposes a two-dimentional levels of adopting digital technologies according to their low-to-high degrees. The proposed framework, in particular the levels of digital technology adoption, are novel to the existing literature. Each of the three parts of the framework and their inter-relationships lays a foundation for further empirical studies in this field. This study also provides guidance for practitioners adopting digital technologies for supply chain management and developing appropriate business strategies at different digitalization levels.}

Further, our framework suggests that the need for data, technology, and talents will lead to more open and collaborative innovation approaches, novel strategies for innovation protection, and the emergence of new roles in innovation teams. Using AI for innovation management also creates challenges like ethical data usage, navigation through diversity emerging from humans collaborating with artificial intelligence, and escaping from the incremental innovation trap.

The empirical results show that DT increases the labor share by easing financial limitations. This conclusion remains valid in a series of robustness tests, such as replacing the calculation methods of core explanatory and predicted variables, and adjusting the time horizon. In addition, the digitalization of state-owned enterprises, labor-intensive enterprises, enterprises with high bargaining power, and enterprises in highly developed digital financial areas, plays a more prominent role in promoting labor share. This study provides new empirical evidence on the income distribution effects of DT.}

To demystify this phenomenon, we draw on the asset orchestration perspective to investigate how breadth (i.e., the scope) and depth (i.e., the scale) of DT deployment influence a firm's resilience to supply chain disruptions. Survey data from 162 Chinese manufacturing firms show that the depth of DT deployment exerts a positive effect on firm resilience. Interestingly, the breadth has a non-significant effect on firm resilience. Moreover, while the breadth and depth of DT deployment both enhance supply chain coordination, supply chain coordination mediates only the relationship between DT deployment depth and firm resilience. Finally, market acuity positively moderates the relationship between supply chain coordination and firm resilience. We contribute to the literature by providing new theoretical explanations for the inconsistency in the reported relationship between technology deployment and resilience. Our study also helps firms reevaluate their DT deployment.}

First, we show that the geographical distribution of important actors correlates with the citizens’ reliance on social media to seek health information. Then, relying on ‘state-of-the-art’ methods in textual analysis, we identify prevalent online topics and show that the United States focuses more on risk management and private funding, whereas Europe focuses more on health literacy, practitioners, and start-ups. Furthermore, institutions focus more on indirect, global, and strategic problematics, whereas specialists are more concerned with direct and concrete problems. We also use creative visualisations displaying semantic relationships along important dimensions of HT, notably in terms of concerns related to technological priorities, professional skills, and privacy issues, as well as a possible shift in concerns related to privacy issues before and after the COVID pandemic.

We then introduce ecological institutional norms (EIN) as the moderating variable to observe whether effective platform governance impacts enterprises' value co–creation (VCC) and IP. We conduct a questionnaire survey on 346 SMEs in China's manufacturing industry that participate in digital platforms, and the regression analysis and the bootstrap test results indicate that (1) DPC has a significantly positive impact on IP; (2) DPC has a significantly positive impact on VCC; (3) VCC partially mediates DPC and IP; (4) EIN positively moderate the relationship between DPC and VCC and positively moderate the mediating effect of VCC. These findings add to the literature on digital platforms theoretically and fill the gap in research on how participation in digital platforms can enhance enterprises' innovation and development from the perspective of SMEs.

Employing a deductive-inductive approach, an exhaustive literature review combined with an in-depth, multiple case study analysis of sixteen firms provides rich insights into the digital transformation journey. Findings reveal technology, data, human capital, processes, and organization structure as key enablers alongside their critical, complementary roles for transformation. Cross-case analysis identified instances of the DT framework, uncovering three archetypes: process efficiency, responsiveness, and strategic agility. Each archetype exhibits distinct socio-technical enabler configurations and improvements to business processes, resulting in unique operational capabilities and value generation. This research provides actionable guidance for managers in leveraging socio-technical enablers to achieve successful digital transformation. It underscores the need for tailored strategies, recognizing that a one-size-fits-all approach is inadequate. Managers must strategically select desired values and develop the necessary socio-technical system components, processes, and operational capabilities to attain them.

The paper discusses metaverse retailing and customer experience research that can advance consumer research and help companies identify metaverse retailing customer experience improvement areas. The paper concludes with possible directions that can be undertaken in future research related to the four themes identified in the context of customer experience in metaverse retailing. The authors also propose three probable future research models that are well grounded in theory and arise from our analysis of work undertaken in the area of customer experience in metaverse retailing.}

However, their strong dependence on the existing economic structure may hinder the pace of digital transformation. Few studies have thoroughly analysed the relationship between natural resources and digital transformation. Building on this gap, this study employs provincial-level data from China from 2000 to 2019 to examine the state of digital transformation in resource-rich regions. The findings indicate that digital transformation is relatively weak in resource-rich regions, as an increase of one billion tons in regional natural resources (coal) leads to a decrease in 0.364 digital patents. It also finds that this drawback of natural resources in digital transformation will likely be counteracted if the regional government possesses a strong awareness, motivation, and capability (awareness-motivation-capability) to seek digital transformation.}

In the era of non-human innovation intermediaries, we should begin to view NLP not only as a useful technology applied in different innovation practices but also as an intermediary orchestrating valuable information. Previous research has not taken this perspective, and knowledge about its intermediation activities and functions is limited. This study reviews 167 academic articles to better understand how NLP approaches can enrich intermediation in early-stage innovation search. It identifies 18 distinctive innovation practices taking over activities like forecasting trends, illustrating technology and idea landscapes, filtering out distinctive contributions, recombining domain-specific and analogous knowledge, or matching problems with solutions. While certain NLP capabilities complement each other, the analysis shows that the choice of the most appropriate approach depends on the characteristics of the innovation practice. Innovation researchers and practitioners should rethink current roles and responsibilities in AI-based innovation processes. As seen in the recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), the rapidly evolving field offers many future research opportunities and practical benefits.}

This study explores how business model transparency (and the absence of it) influences users' decisions to adopt a digital service. We propose a model grounded in rational choice theory, tested through multigroup structural equation modeling. Data were collected through a field experiment that exposed users to two different mock-ups characterized by varying levels of transparency related to data usage. The results show that the level of transparency does not directly influence users' willingness to adopt the service. Switching from a transparent to an opaque data-driven business model negatively affects users' willingness to adopt a service. Such findings remark on the users’ service adoption decision-making process criteria, which are highly influenced by perceived data usage transparency. Consequently, this study introduces a user perspective on data-driven business models. It conveys to managers the importance of transparency when business models are grounded in data-driven strategies and data exploitation.}

Whether the business model changes and economic development facilitated by digital technologies will enable China to achieve its goal of a low-carbon transition remains to be seen. Based on 269 cities in China from 2006 to 2021, the study used two-way fixed effects and instrumental variables to analyze the role of DT in carbon reduction and its indirect mechanisms. The results indicate that the wide application and deep integration of DT in the physical industry will reduce carbon emissions (CE). The mechanism analysis reveals that DT, with its efficient, integrated, and green characteristics, will help improve energy efficiency and promote green technology innovation, thereby reducing CE. Most importantly, this study innovatively reveals the role of virtual agglomeration in carbon reduction. It uses data factors with production characteristics to shift the supply and demand parties and related enterprises from physical space to cyberspace agglomeration, which plays a significant positive role in the process of reducing CE. DT has a heterogeneous effect on reducing CE, especially in the sample of urban agglomeration and resource-based cities, which is more intense. The central government's policies on digital infrastructure and CE regulation influence the role of digital technologies in reducing CE. The conclusions of this study have implications for relevant market entities and the government to fully utilise DT to accelerate the realisation of green production and cope with climate change.}

Institutional theory highlights the pressures, both coercive and normative, arising from the digital economy and regulatory environments, whereas resource dependence theory elucidates the strategic approaches organizations adopt to acquire vital resources and minimize network dependencies. This innovative research investigates how an organization's orientation towards the digital economy affects its role within R&D networks, leveraging insights from both theoretical standpoints. By pinpointing technology transformation and legal environment as key moderators, this study assesses their moderating effects. The analysis utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing 141,118 patents spanning from 1995 to 2018, concentrating on R&D efforts within China's strategic emerging sectors. The outcomes show that an organization's digital economy orientation, shaped by institutional norms and resource interdependencies, positively influences its network centrality but negatively impacts its structural hole position. Additionally, technology transformation and the legal environment, as institutional mechanisms, negatively modulate the relationship between digital economy orientation and network centrality, but positively influence the structural hole relationship. The study concludes with a bibliometric analysis to situate our findings within existing literature and discusses the theoretical and practical implications, rooted in institutional and resource dependence theories.}

They neither have selection freedom nor adoption willingness. The aim of this exploratory research is to understand managers' perceptions around accepting these imposed technology-driven compliance standards in the name of safety through an empirical study of the RMG sector in Bangladesh. We have used the extended framework of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) model with certain modifications. After analyzing data through structural equation modeling (SEM), a modified theoretical framework was revealed to capture managers' behavioral intention toward a complex technological system that does not automatically arise from self-willingness; rather it is mandatory acceptance. Based on this knowledge, we recommend that the UTAUT2 model be extended and revised to capture this kind of mandatory adoption of technology. The findings of this research can provide deep and effective knowledge and experience to international buyers in the RMG sector, global supply chain members, RMG factory owners, and government policymakers.}

However, these advances have given rise to the development of sophisticated strategies for data management, predicting user behavior, or analyzing their actions. Accordingly, the large-scale analysis of user-generated data (UGD) has led to the emergence of user privacy concerns about how companies manage user data. Although there are some studies on data security, privacy protection, and data-driven strategies, a systematic review on the subject that would focus on both UGD and DDI as main concepts is lacking. Therefore, the present study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the main challenges related to user privacy that affect DDI. The methodology used in the present study unfolds in the following three phases; (i) a systematic literature review (SLR); (ii) in-depth interviews framed in the perspectives of UGD and DDI on user privacy concerns, and finally, (iii) topic-modeling using a Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model to extract insights related to the object of study. Based on the results, we identify 14 topics related to the study of DDI and UGD strategies. In addition, 14 future research questions and 7 research propositions are presented that should be consider for the study of UGD, DDI and user privacy in digital markets. The paper concludes with an important discussion regarding the role of user privacy in DDI in digital markets.}

However, following the recent COVID-19 pandemic crisis, distributors have been seeking to become more agile in identifying and transforming business processes to avoid failures. Although industrial practitioners have been broadly motivated to understand the effects of pandemics on business failure, the contingency factors that affect organizations in their responses to such sudden exogenous shocks remain unclear. Inspired by a burgeoning academic interest in viewing the COVID-19 pandemic as a digital accelerator, this paper examines how B2B distribution firms have been avoiding business failure by using their dynamic capabilities (DCs) in response to the sudden exogenous shocks caused by the pandemic. Based on data drawn from interviews conducted with a sample of B2B distribution firms, we argue that capitalizing on digital DCs—digital sensing (i.e., digital mindset crafting and digital scenario planning), digital seizing (i.e., engaging in strategic agility and balancing a digital portfolio), and digital transformation (i.e., navigating the innovation ecosystem, redesigning the internal structure, and improving digital maturity), —helps to prevent business failure during a pandemic.}

This study adopts an exploratory approach to improve existing understanding about the strategies that financial platforms implement. In addition, we explore what incumbents are doing to ‘survive’ and if the measures they are taking are sufficient to achieve survival. Further, we examine whether customer-focused strategies, such as Experience-Based Offerings (EBOs), provide the best solution for financial service firms to gain competitive advantage. The findings show that strategies can be implemented successfully by integrating technology to improve, personalize, and customize customer experiences, while managers and employees can add quality to experiences. This study contributes to our understanding of business platforms by identifying how they are designed and managed, and how incumbents can learn from them to respond to the challenges presented by today’s rapidly changing consumer behavior.

abstract = {The rapid industrialization and growth across the world have fostered the consumption of luxury fashion brands. Electronic word-of- mouth on social media (eWOM) is fast becoming an effective and germane strategy to engage luxury consumers through posting pictures, sharing reviews, and communicating information on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. Extant research has not examined the antecedents and drivers that lead to eWOM behavior. We leverage self-congruity theory and through its focal lens, our study addresses this research gap through a survey conducted with 453 consumers in Mexico, Latin America's fastest growing market. Our results indicate that need for status, susceptibility to normative influence, and luxury brand involvement, moderated by authentic pride and social media influencers lead to eWOM behavior on social media. We also demonstrate that luxury brand involvement and susceptibility to normative influence mediate the relationship between need for status and eWOM behavior on social media. The study provides important implications to managers and researchers by suggesting long-term actionable strategies for growth that can help luxury firms develop a sustainable competitive advantage over rivals and competitors.}

This research seeks to elucidate the influence of Digital Entrepreneurship Education (DEE) on the interrelations among Attitude (ATT), Subjective Norms (SNs), Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC), Personal Innovativeness (PI), and Digital Entrepreneurship Intention (DEI) among university students in emerging nations. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) serves as the theoretical foundation for this study. The study adopts a quantitative research design, utilizing a survey questionnaire to garner information from a subset of business college students in Vietnam. A total of 334 valid responses were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), facilitating the testing of the research hypotheses. The study revealed a positive correlation between TPB constructs, PI, and DEI among university students in developing economies. However, the relationship between PBC and DEI was inversely affected by DEE. Furthermore, the study found no evidence to support the moderating effects of DEE on the relationship between ATT, SNs, PI, and DEI. This research contributes significantly to entrepreneurship studies by investigating the impact of DEE on students' inclination to embark on DE in developing countries. It extends the theoretical framework of TPB by integrating PI and underscores the importance of DEE in fostering DE. Moreover, the findings of this study hold several implications for academic administrators, policymakers, and educators. These insights can be leveraged to devise strategies and initiatives to enhance support and advancement for DEE.}

Nevertheless, few studies empirically analyse how it acts as a binding force of both business practices. This study examines 1501 sustainability reports using a mixed human-artificial intelligence method based on Python's text mining libraries. This method takes advantage of AI's capabilities to extract information from large samples of data and of human critical thinking to find patterns in those data. Specifically, the method is used to evaluate the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies, analyse how they are deployed worldwide, and investigate their sustainability outcomes. In terms of overall frequency, robots and cybersecurity are the most often reported technologies. Broken down by the firm's region, Asian firms have the highest rate of adoption, while African firms are lagging. Regarding the themes, Industry 4.0 is mainly adopted to improve production processes and customer experience. A small percentage of firms, particularly in Europe and North America, utilize Industry 4.0 to reduce the environmental footprint of their operations. Furthermore, results indicate that Industry 4.0 and sustainability are following two routes. Some firms have massively adopted Industry 4.0 to increase operational efficiency and reaped environmental gains as an indirect consequence of improved operations. Others have chosen to balance the adoption of technologies aimed to increase productivity with innovations whose explicit aim is the reduction of their operations' environmental footprint, such as additive manufacturing. Eastern firms tend to follow the first route while western firms the second. African and South American firms are still at a very early stage in their Industry 4.0 and sustainability journey. At the global level, Industry 4.0 is still far from being utilized as a catalyst to develop sustainability-driven business models.}

Consumption is an eternal issue in economic development; however, most existing studies have concentrated on how digital inclusive Finance affects household consumption levels, giving little attention to consumption volatility. Nonetheless, policies that overlook consumption volatility are less likely to achieve societal welfare goals, particularly in developing countries. This study aims to fill this gap and unveil the “black box” of the impact of digital inclusive Finance on consumption volatility, which can benefit the development of economic resilience. Utilizing data from the China Household Finance Survey, our research assesses the impact of digital inclusive Finance on household consumption volatility and discovers that digital inclusive Finance significantly smooths out these fluctuations. Mechanism tests further indicate that the main transmission channels for this impact are promoting entrepreneurship and reducing income volatility. Moreover, heterogeneity tests show that the effect of digital inclusive Finance in smoothing household consumption volatility is more pronounced in households with sound financial standing, higher financial literacy, and internet access, especially in rural areas. These findings enrich the literature on digital inclusive Finance's role in managing volatility and extend the theory on the inclusive nature of digital inclusive Finance, offering valuable practical implications for developing countries.}

The digital innovation captures customer experience in real time, enabling measurement of a wide range of discrete emotions on the studied social media platform, which goes beyond traditional tools that capture positive or negative sentiment only. During the digital intervention, a substantial number of inauthentic and bot like behaviours was revealed, unbeknown to the case organisation. These accounts were found to be posting and amplifying highly emotional and potentially damaging content surrounding the case brand and its products. The study illustrates how emotion in the context of customer experience should go beyond typical categorisations, given the complexity of human emotion, while a distinction between bot and authentic users is imperative for CEM.}

By employing the difference-in-differences (DID) method, this study finds that manufacturing firms in regulated sectors are more likely to develop services than those in non-regulated sectors. However, manufacturing firms prefer to develop basic rather than advanced services. Additionally, resource slack positively moderates the effects of environmental regulations on servitization. This study provides policy and managerial implications concerning environmental regulations on manufacturing firms’ adoption of service-related environmental innovations.}

Especially, NTBFs rapidly respond to technological change, and their investment information is a significant criterion of technology valuation. Therefore, this study proposes a new technology opportunity discovery (TOD) framework that exploits text mining by deep learning and a knowledge graph (KG) by using three data sources: technology, NTBF, and investor data. First, a technology-classification model was developed using technical text data acquired using Doc2vec and logistic regression, and then this model assigned highly-relevant technology fields to NTBFs using NTBFs’ investor relation text data. Next, a KG that considers technology, NTBF, and NTBF’s investor was constructed to represent their relations for TOD by using the results of previous steps. Lastly, considering inter-connectivities of such factors, a TOD index that measures the potential of technologies was proposed. The accuracy and validity of the methods were demonstrated empirically, and an evaluation of emerging technologies identified by the analysis was provided. Our framework will be of great significance as a useful alternative to provide new insights for emerging technologies in the industry and market.}

In addition, the role of self-brand connection as a moderator and consumer engagement as a mediator is also examined. A large-scale survey was conducted with 485 consumers who follow brand pages at a popular social networking site. The findings reveal that experiential value has a positive impact on consumer engagement, while consumer engagement is positively associated with brand loyalty and satisfaction, which in turn leads to value co-creation.

The findings indicate that platform BMI type experiences a change process from Focus BMI to Complex BMI at different development stages. At different stages, platform BMI is highly interconnected because of the continuous accumulation and utilization of digital resources. The two drivers, external pressure and management cognition, act as trigger and filter, respectively, in the process of platform BMI. These results also suggest that platforms have successively formed three different value co-creation models in the BMI process.}

However, scholars have long expressed concern that open innovation also entails a dark side, which can result in value co-destruction. This concern highlights the importance of devoting attention to the perils of pursuing open innovation. Existing scholarship has given due credence to these perils by examining various associated risks and uncertainties. We observe that the extant literature is siloed and unorganized, which impedes future research. Positing that an endeavor to organize existing studies may enhance the pace of research in the area, we attempt to address this gap by reviewing the relevant literature. We thus utilize the systematic literature review approach to identify, synthesize, and critically analyze 80 related research articles. Based on this analysis, we present the bibliometric profile of the extant research and a typology of five risks in open innovation: data-related risks, people-related risks, firm-level risks, outcome risks, and other risks. In addition, we discuss a specific risk management approach for each of the identified risks. Beyond providing a lucid narrative of the extant literature, we also identify unexplored avenues and offer an overarching framework to conceptualize future research potential in the area. From a practical perspective, managers can utilize this framework as a risk assessment tool when engaging in open innovation. In sum, this review—one of the first of its kind—offers a valuable consolidation of the state of the art of open innovation risk research, which can meaningfully advance theory and practice in the area.}

Using mixed research methods with data collected from Danish IIs, we find that IIs' current use level of digital resources has a positive relationship with their intention of offering digital and data services, while the level of existing digital services demotivates or prevents IIs from providing them. We also find that the breadth of IIs' customers and partnerships is not directly associated with their intention to offer more digital services in the future. These findings are enriched with nuanced insights from a follow-up qualitative study showing that strategic partners do not provide the required support for intermediaries to develop and provide digital offerings. Instead, IIs rely on system integrators to equip themselves with the needed digital capacity to support their members/customers. The study contributes to the understanding of IIs’ business models linked to their service catalogue, particularly on digital offerings and their function as digitalization champions in a shifting paradigm of industrial digital transformation. Furthermore, it adds knowledge about open innovation by researching service offerings and relevant resources and capabilities of IIs as network organizations.}

Given this research gap, the paper aims at studying Industry 4.0 and sustainability with its three pillars. A systematic review of the literature has been performed to analyze the main topic, the pillars of sustainability mainly considered and last, the possible outfalls of Industry 4.0 on sustainability. From a theoretical point of view, this paper contributes to the systematization of literature at the intersection between Industry 4.0 and sustainability, while from a managerial point of view it sheds light on implications and opportunities arising from considering the outfalls of innovations coming from Industry 4.0 on sustainability and its pillars.}

This research proposes a fresh framework using social media data to improve demand forecasting accuracy, resulting in a cost-efficient inventory control strategy. Drawing upon the resource mobilization perspective in particular, this research quantifies the construct of CE from the view of input–output efficiency evaluation using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model, and then leverages CE to forecast consumer online demand and reconfigure inventory management strategy. Using a 71-week data set from a social commerce start-up in China, this research shows that this new framework dramatically increases demand forecasting accuracy and reduces operational costs in inventory management. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating the value of social media data in improving operational efficiency, particularly regarding inventory management.}

abstract = {Tens of millions of people worldwide – at a minimum – are victims of modern slavery (MS), including various forms of human trafficking, forced labor, and child labor. In the current digitization era, digital technology may be used to recruit or control MS victims, but it also has the potential to mitigate MS risks in supply chains. However, although scholars have increasingly focused on this social issue, the critical role of digital technology in MS risk mitigation remains unclear. This research aims to identify which digital technologies are adopted by focal firms to mitigate MS risks and explore how institutional changes affect technology adoption. We conducted a qualitative secondary data analysis by performing content analysis on MS statements for financial years from 2017 to 2021 issued by the top 50 firms selected from the Fortune Global 500 list. According to our coding results, we identified seven types of digital technology adopted by focal firms and key actors involved in digital technology adoption in the MS context to form an MS risk mitigation ecosystem. Based on the socio-technical perspective and institutional theory, we further proposed a conceptual framework to link the institutional pressures to digital technology adoption. We found that normative pressures from NGOs tend to promote high-complexity technology, whereas coercive pressures from governments tend to tolerate low-complexity technology. Mimetic pressures from competitors tend to promote low-complexity technology adoption. In this context, firms respond to government regulations more positively than to NGO initiatives. This paper is the first to explore digital technology adoption as a way of mitigating MS risks and to propose a conceptual framework to inspire managers, policy makers and other stakeholders.}

Although many researchers have tried to study technological evolution, their works have some limitations because they must consider not only technology evolution but also social evolution in a social system, such as social institutions, markets, and customer acceptance. In addition, previous techno-socio co-evolution studies mostly focused on case analyses based on a theoretical research framework. Thus, in this study, we propose a framework for analyzing co-evolution in terms of the technological-social aspect using topic modeling to analyze the evolutionary patterns of social and technological topics and performing time-series analysis of co-evolution using the HMM model based on the contents of technology and society. In this study, we collected technology-specialized news articles for 20 years for autonomous vehicles, which have been the biggest issue in technology and society in recent years. Using the HMM-based on the derived technological-social anchored topic, we derived the techno-socio co-evolution sequence and analyzed the evolutionary pattern of technological development after the emergence of new technology and the techno-socio co-evolution pattern leading to policy establishment. The techno-socio co-evolution pattern derived from this study will contribute to technology planning and policy establishment.}

We identified inter-age-group path differences in consumer involvement and purchase intention once the misleading claims in the advertisements had been highlighted. The results indicated the following: (1) Online botanical dietary supplement (BDS) consumption is a rational utilitarian-driven behaviour, with cognitive product involvement playing a dominant role in the decision-making. (2) Cognitive product involvement and affective advertisement involvement positively affect mature consumers’ situational involvement. (3) Situational involvement mediates the effects of product involvement and advertisement involvement on purchase intention; once misleading claims are highlighted to consumers, the consumers place themselves in a specific purchase situation and cautiously evaluate BDS product before consumption. (4) Middle-aged and older adults have different information-processing paths when faced with BDS purchases. Specifically, middle-aged consumers are more capable of identifying misleading information during their decision-making than are older adults; conversely, older-adult consumers are more easily swayed by health-evoking visual cues in advertisements, thus prompting them to purchase the advertised BDSs. Our findings indicate that consumer education is crucial and that consumers must be vigilant against being swayed by misleading advertisements. This study extends the model of consumer involvement and offers educational programmes of identifying misleading claims in advertisements that can be applied in middle-aged and older consumers to improve their risk perception within the context of online Chinese BDS advertisements.}

Firms follow up with these consumers by sending reminder ads to keep their products that consumers abandoned in their carts on top of their minds till their online search ends. Consumers vary in their degree of preference match with firms’ products; the higher preference mismatch, the longer a consumer searches online seeking a better matching alternative. Firms can infer consumers’ preferences based on their digital footprints during their online search and customize their reminder advertising campaign. The default strategy is to pursue all website visitors with a uniform reminder advertising campaign.

Although there are historical advantages, customer churn rate has been increasing in recent years. To better respond to market competition, national broadcast service providers such as cable network enterprises should recognize customer preference and forecast customer churn intention before the competition does. Based on a positivist approach, customer churn is related to watching intensity, consumption amount, and paying habits. Watching preference (as the exclusive resource) has only a moderate effect on customer watching intensity and customer churn. In order to explore the mechanism between variables and observe user retention strategies, in-depth interviews were conducted.

In contrast, contingencies related to the power of the LEM and the presence and interaction of buyers and sellers (consociality) may evoke a dark side of AI. Guided by literature on LEMs, AI, and agency theory, the current work establishes buy- and sell-side tensions that arise when LEMs deploy AI.

This work studies the moderating roles of innovative infusion of ChatGPT and ethical identity in the association between incorporating ChatGPT into standard processes with operational and market agilities. Data from a survey of IT executives were analyzed to validate our proposed hypotheses. We found that while the infusion of ChatGPT in an organization moderates the relationship between ChatGPT incorporation and operational agility, infusion does not significantly impact market agilities. In addition, we found that a firm's ethical identity moderates ChatGPT-enabled market agilities but not operational agility. We also found that both types of agility play mediating roles in improving firm performance. This study adds to the growing body of literature on dynamic capabilities by presenting and testing a theory on the influence of a firm's capability to incorporate ChatGPT on agility, firm performance, and the role of ChatGPT infusion and firm ethical identity.}

Therefore, motivated by a highly dynamic but at the same time rather unstructured body of literature, this review offers a systematic and critical analyses of studies related to Technology and Innovation Management (TIM) research that address convergence from a processual perspective. Four major strands can be identified: (1) drivers and patterns of convergence, (2) anticipation of convergence, (3) strategic reactions to convergence, and (4) convergent products. A key finding of this review is that most contributions have been inward oriented, i.e. understanding the dynamics of convergence. A consequence of this inner focus is that the scientific discourse on convergence has to some degree unfolded independently from its theoretical underpinnings. To this end, this review provides a comprehensive framework of convergence research, including current challenges and emerging themes to address these challenges. The resulting research agenda serves as a starting point to inspire future studies of relevance for theory and conceptual development as well as managerial practice.}

Moreover, we consider variances in effects across different post types and firm sizes. Applying advanced cognitive analytics and deep learning techniques, our analysis reveals a significant association between the emotions of fear and anger expressed in posts related to firm events or routine work and firm value, with more pronounced effects observed in small firms. Additionally, our machine learning experiments demonstrate that social executives’ emotions contribute to more accurate predictions of firm value than sentiments alone.

The artificial intelligence (AI)-powered digital technologies applications continue to emerge to enhance and improve novel ways of communication on social media platforms, particularly Instagram. Indeed, this has caused a change in the behavioral and social customer journey, where customers need to embrace a digital experience adoption. The AI applications primarily aim to study the shoppers browsing trend to draw new clients and expand businesses. Even the fashion industry has tapped into Instagram's business benefits in this fast-paced and competitive industry. With this quick and compelling way to capture shoppers’ attention towards fashion products, the purchase decision may differ between e-shoppers and conventional shoppers. AI seems to be extremely promising and has the potential to be a game changer for Instagram users, advertisers, and influencers. This study applies the Engel-Kollat-Blackwell (EKB) theory to investigate the effects of AI-based digital technology experiences on Instagrammers’ fashion apparel purchase decisions - perceived eWOM, perceived emotional value, perceived quality, perceived risk and perceived price. Based on data collected from Instagram users, the framework of this study was evaluated using structural equation modelling (SEM). Semi-structured in-depth interviews were also conducted as part of the research to get a more in-depth understanding of the profiles and behaviors of Instagram users. Our findings from both methodologies confirm that perceived emotional value, perceived quality, and perceived eWOM revealed a statistically significant and positive influence on Instagrammers’ purchase decisions for fashion apparel. Meanwhile, the importance performance matrix analysis (IPMA) identified perceived emotional value as the most important factor for Instagrammers, but the highest performance was perceived quality. This research has important implications for Malaysian online retailers and shoppers to adapt to the fast-changing digital transformation. Assuredly, this study makes a noteworthy contribution to attitudinal research on social media commerce within the fashion industry.}

This bibliometric study aims to make overall research scenarios on RRR & Supply chain by analyzing the published papers. For a collection of exclusive papers in this area, we rely on the well-known trustworthy database SCOPUS. The bibliometric study is done by the contents of publication and citation structure of influential papers, leading authors, institutions, and countries, citation structure of top ten journals, country analysis in the area of RRR & Supply chain research. Present study reveals that S.M. Gupta has the highest number of publications, the USA is the most influential country, the renowned ‘Journal of Cleaner Production’ has published the greatest number of papers, and the Institute ‘Huazhong University of Science and Technology’ has the highest number of publications in this field. Through data mining this work revealed that closed loop supply chain, industry, waste, review, policy, circular economy, and sustainability are mostly used keywords while highly cited articles frequently used keywords like supply chain management; closed-loop supply chain; reverse logistics; article; logistics; manufacture; costs; decision making; environmental impact; and waste management. This study will help to fill the research gap and show a roadmap for future research direction in this area.}

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of anthropomorphic appearance on consumer behavior and brand evaluation under different AI product types. It was conducted in China, a new but rapidly-growing country in the field of Internet, AI technology and AI product consumption. This study conducted four situational experiments with a 2 (anthropomorphic design: anthropomorphic vs. non-anthropomorphic) × 2 (product type: hedonic vs. utilitarian) between subjects’ experimental design. Data was collected from 1172 Chinese “Digital Natives” by using a structured questionnaire. The findings revealed that for hedonic AI products, anthropomorphic appearance improves consumers' purchase intention and brand evaluation through perceived entertainment, and intelligence level significantly moderates the mediating effect of perceived entertainment; while for practical AI products, anthropomorphic appearance improves consumers' purchase intention and brand evaluation through perceived usefulness, and intelligence level does not significantly moderate the mediating effect of perceived usefulness. There is no significant moderating effect of intelligence level on perceived usefulness. The study contributes to development and validation of a more comprehensive understanding and theoretical foundation of anthropomorphism, and furthermore explores the impact of anthropomorphic appearance on consumer behavior and brand evaluation under different AI product types. This study also provides insights for companies to apply anthropomorphic strategies.}

abstract = {The integration of products and services into a bundled product/service offering by manufacturing organisations is seen as a global trend in today’s competitive business environment. The shift of product-based manufacturers towards offering business solutions and value-added services to consumers is termed as ‘Servitization’. Contrary to the potential benefits expected by adding service activities to the offerings, advocates voice their concerns towards experiential problems and challenges in employing the servitization strategy – termed as ‘Servitization Paradox’. Nevertheless, the shift from product-based delivery to a service-based provision has the potential to significantly impact on developing sustainable and eco-friendly environment. To provide greater insights to the servitization phenomenon, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the servitization implementation in manufacturing organisations. In order to respond to the latter, we propose the following three research questions “Q1 – what are the different types of servitization strategies”, “Q2 – what are the different servitization definitions”, “Q3 – what are the potential benefits in selecting a servitization strategy?”, “Q4 – what are the challenges in transitioning towards servitization?”. A systematic literature review is carried out to understand the past trends and extant patterns/themes in the servitization strategy research area, evaluate contributions, summarise knowledge, thereby identifying limitations, implications and potential further research avenues. The key findings confirm servitization studies have contributed both conceptually and empirically to the development and accumulation of intellectual wealth to the manufacturing operations and supply chain discipline. Moreover, the findings clearly indicate the potential of servitization in transitioning manufacturing organisations (e.g. benefits) and utilising innovative technologies to generate business value. Nevertheless, some voices are backing further research/development in the area of servitization due to the several existing challenges.}

Followingly, we undertake 52 in-depth online qualitative surveys (employing a laddering approach) from UK HE employees to better understand the emotional and psychological consequences of technology adoption. The results highlight four distinct phases based on the functional and emotional impact of technology: secure, scrutinize, streamline, and sustain. We observe that several distinct positive (e.g., empowerment and self-efficacy), and negative (e.g., isolation and stress) psychological consequences emerge in each phase, which are concomitant with the transition from an emergency/rapid to planned/proactive technology adoption and integration. This study offers a framework demonstrating the impact of technology adoption on employee emotions and how these emotions change during the transition from rapid to planned technology adoption. Thus, given the importance of emotions within organizations, the implications of our work offer valuable insights for organizations transitioning from emergency to planned technology adoption in the future.}

The model is validated using PLS analysis and data from 397 health app users from China. The study finds that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, flow experience and behavioral change techniques are significant predictors of CI, and satisfaction mediates these effects. Health consciousness positively moderates the effect between perceived usefulness and satisfaction and negatively moderates the effect between perceived ease of use and satisfaction.

The paper discusses the relationships between AI and rapid developments in machine learning and sustainable development (SD). Specifically, the aim is to understand whether this branch of computer science can influence production and consumption patterns to achieve sustainable resource management according to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in the UN 2030 Agenda. Moreover, the paper aims to highlight the role of Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) in the cultural drift toward the spread of AI for SBMs. Despite the importance of the topic, there is no comprehensive review of the AI and SBM literature in light of SDGs. Based on a database containing 73 publications in English with publication dates from 1990 to 2019, a bibliometric analysis is conducted. The findings show that the innovation challenge involves ethical, social, economic, and legal aspects. Thus, considering that the development potential of AI is linked to the UN 2030 Agenda for SD, especially to SDG#12, our results also outline the framework of the existing literature on AI and SDGs, especially SDG#12, including AI’s association with the cultural drift (CD) in the SBMs. The paper highlights the key contributions, which are: i) a comprehensive review of the key underlying relationship between AI and SBMs, offering a holistic view as needed, ii) identifying a research gap regarding KMS through AI, and iii) the implications of AI concerning SDG#12. Academic and managerial implications are also discussed regarding KMS in the SBMs, where the AI can represent the vehicle to meet the SDGs allowing for the identification of the cultural change required by enterprises to achieve sustainable goals. Thus, business companies, academic research practitioners, and state policy should focus on the further development of the use of AI in SBMs.}

Thematic analysis offers a rigorous approach to analysis and enables articulating deeper and meaningful understandings of individual director experiences. Findings presented as a framework, indicate that DT impacts all board directors’ capabilities as four major aspects: gathering, interpreting and sharing information; board stewardship; blue-sky strategizing; and scoping predictive strategic priorities. Theoretical contribution is to Resource Dependence Theory (RDT) as an outcome-focused lens, which best explains a firm’s interest in digital technological advantage through board contribution and outcomes. In conclusion, practical insights for board members and regulators are highlighted.}

The contribution to literature is two-fold. First, we define a framework to structure usage data into cross-sectional features that could be included in predictive models. We study the impact of usage information on churn prediction performance along three primary components– timing, granularity, and expertise. The findings confirm the value of this data source and two of the three examined components, particularly in terms of AUC and TDL. Second, we provide insights into the carbon footprint of the entire modeling process required to integrate usage data into different machine-learning algorithms. Furthermore, to strengthen the robustness of our findings, we compare five common machine-learning algorithms in CCP. Consequently, this study uncovered unexplored aspects of usage data and practical implications for enhancing churn prediction in a B2B setting.}

Multiple factors are neatly associated with pharmaceutical R&D activities. Adverse drug reaction (ADR) is one of the main reasons for drug R&D failure. However, the current technology opportunities identification (TOI) approaches seldom try to identify pharmaceutical-specific technology opportunities from the perspective of ADR. Except that, pharmaceutical R&D activities are a complex process involving the interaction of disease, drug, and gene. Nevertheless, pharmaceutical TOI research often overlooks the relationships among various diseases, ADRs, drugs, and genes. In response, this article proposed a domain-specific multilayer network framework for pharmaceutical TOI from the standpoint of ADRs. Compared with previous research, there are three extensions. The first extension is identifying pharmaceutical TOI from the ADR's perspective. The second extension is identifying pharmaceutical technological opportunities based on multilayer networks. The last extension is integrating multi-source data in multilayer networks. Then, the proposed framework is applied to hyperuricemia drugs to prove their efficiency and effectiveness. This framework helps explain the complex relationships among diseases, ADRs, drugs, and genes. Furthermore, the analysis results provide interesting insight into pharmaceutical TOI and extend the multilayer network theory.}

However, the I4.0 concept also comprises broader changes in the company's business model (BM) through digital transformation, which deserves more attention, especially from the technology providers' perspective. As they are essential to advancing the digital transformation diffusion and creating I4.0 ecosystems, their business model innovation (BMI) in this context is a keystone for I4.0. Thus, we consider how changing factors in the I4.0 context affect the business model dimensions of technology providers. We analyze changing factors in the three main BM dimensions: front-end, back-end, and value proposition. We study ten I4.0 technology providers and explain the mechanisms of change involved in their BMI, explaining how and why such changes happen. The findings provide practitioners with insights to anticipate the necessary actions to manage and incorporate such changes, whether they rely more on data and IoT devices, new BMs such as training and consulting, dynamic pricing forms, new software/hardware, or service competencies. We also provide a detailed analysis of elements of change in the BM that can be used in theory to understand better the different digital transformation impacts in the Industry 4.0 context.}

Moreover, particularly at the post-entry stage, we still have a limited understanding of how MNEs identify, pre-empt, manage, and mitigate the various knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship risks found in foreign markets over the various stages of their subsidiaries’ life cycles within their innovative ecosystems. We argued that, in host countries characterised by substantial dynamic risks, MNEs are likely to adjust their risk management and mitigation strategies based on the experiences they gain in four distinct phases: pre-entry (when decisions on mode of entry are made), immediate post-entry, current status, and future strategies and plans. Within innovative ecosystems, these dynamics are compounded in emerging market contexts; in particular, those relating to FDI destined to other emerging markets. We contribute to the literature through a unique case study narrative obtained by drawing on multiple triangulated sources of data, including in-depth interviews and archival data, which led to nine key future research directions.

abstract = {Amidst the rapid transformations ushered in by digital technology, which forges comprehensive digital connections across research & development (R&D) networks, leaders of pioneering organizations are diligently predicting market shifts, leveraging insights from institutional and network theories. This research enriches understanding by exploring how the digital technology adoption focus of innovative organizations affects their position within R&D networks, integrating perspectives from both theories. It identifies market participation and market maturity as key moderating factors and assesses their differential moderation effects. Employing a panel dataset of 1654 records from 2010 to 2022, which scrutinizes industry-university-research (IUR) R&D endeavors in China, the analysis demonstrates that an organization's digital technology adoption orientation positively influences its network centrality but adversely affects its position in structural holes. Additionally, the study finds that market participation diminishes the positive relationship between digital technology adoption focus and both network centrality and structural hole bridging capabilities. Conversely, market maturity enhances the association with network centrality but weakens the capacity to bridge structural holes. Further analysis was conducted on the temporal variations and the relationship between digital technology adoption and R&D network centrality and structural holes within heterogeneous innovative organizations. The investigation concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of these findings, rooted in institutional and network theory insights.}

The enormous resources poured into their development consist of financial capital, but also natural, human and social resources converted into infrastructure and real estate. The latter act as physical capital storage and sites for the creation of digital products and services expected to generate the highest value added. Smart cities serve as temporary spatial fixes until new and better investments opportunities emerge. Drawing from a comprehensive range of publications on capitalism, this article analyzes smart city developments as typifier of 21st century capital accumulation where the financialization of various capitals is the overarching driver and ecological overshoot and socio-economic undershoot are the main negative consequences. It closely examines six spatial manifestations of the smart city – science parks and smart campuses; innovation districts; smart neighborhoods; city-wide and city-regional smart initiatives; urban platforms; and alternative smart city spaces – as receptacles for the conversion of various capitals. It also considers the influence of different national regimes and institutional contexts on smart city developments. This is used, in the final part, to open a discussion about opportunities to temper the excesses of 21st century capitalism.}

abstract = {In practice, fairness concerns always have significant impacts on the performance of IT service supply chain (ITSSC). However, the existing research on IT sourcing lacks attention to this issue. In this study, we consider an ITSSC with a software developer, a service provider, and client enterprises. The developer authorizes its software to the provider, and then the provider sells the software to the clients. The provider also provides clients with free pre-sale services before they purchase the software, and then the clients can purchase the extended warranty service (EWS) from the developer. Three scenarios are discussed in this study; that is, the supply chain members have no fairness concerns, the developer has fairness concern, and the provider has fairness concern. We find that in the latter two scenarios, the fairness concern has strongly negative impact on the quality of the pre-sale service, but weakly negative impacts on the price of the software and that of EWS. As a result, the fairness concern leads to a decline in the demand of the software and that of EWS. We also observe that the existence of a firm's fairness concern not only reduces its own profit, but also decreases the profit of the partner, which ultimately results in the loss of ITSSC performance. Furthermore, compared with the scenario where the provider has fairness concern, the loss of the performance is greater than that in the scenario where the developer has that.}

This study examines the benefits and challenges that online shopping carnivals bring to e-retailers as success metrics evolve. Based on the pre- and post-promotion dip theory, we investigate whether the surge in demand during online shopping carnivals is borrowed from preceding or subsequent periods. Our dataset contains information regarding consumer browsing and purchasing behaviors in an online B2C pharmaceutical retailer. Main findings from our analysis of China's Double Eleven, a super-sized online shopping carnival, confirm the existence of pre- and post-promotion dips conversion rates, while there are no significant cumulative adverse impacts on sales and orders before and after OSC. This outcome effectively alleviates concerns that OSCs could create operational challenges for retailers. We observe that the pre- and post-promotion dip effect manifests in changes in consumers' visiting behavior, including visit depth, visit length, and bounce rate. Exploratory analyses encompass the impact of online shopping carnivals on product returns, shifts in consumer groups, and the moderating influence of the shopping channel. We analyze the disparities in visit behavior between the PC and mobile channels and offer insights for channel-specific promotional strategies.}

Present a distinctive prediction model to calculate perceived helpfulness to avoid the three biases caused by helpfulness voting method that is widely adopted in research of perceived satisfaction; 3. Take advantage of the uncertainty of information entropy to effectively avoid the problem that the satisfaction of new product features cannot be accurately mined and analyzed on account of frequency and quantity. 4. Calculate the perceived satisfaction results on weighted basis and conduct competition analysis in comparison with the results of congeneric products to further refine the satisfaction result.

Anticipating innovation trajectories could help decision-makers develop new capabilities to take advantage of incremental and disruptive innovations. This paper maps the current innovation that is taking place in the electricity sector using a bottom-up approach by analyzing the value proposition pursued by startups worldwide. We compiled a database of 320 startups whose focus is the electricity sector. We classified these startups according to their business propositions in the context of megatrends disrupting the electricity sector. From analyzing this dataset, we find the following. Photovoltaic generation (PV) is the primary technology for decarbonization. Innovation within PV focuses on developing more resistant materials, panels that are easier to install, or maintain. These innovations do not need an updated regulatory-market structure of the industry to be deployed. Digitalization is the key disruptive/breakthrough innovation. It has the potential to reshape businesses and the regulatory-market structure. Storage technologies can be very disruptive for the power sector, but the innovation we observe in storage technology is incremental. This includes batteries that last longer, that charge in shorter periods of time, or that use other less expensive raw materials, or more energy density –more kilowatt-hours per kilogram.}

However, the current digitalization of manufacturing enterprises lacks upstream and downstream linkage. If the level of digitization of upstream and downstream enterprises differs significantly, it will increase transaction costs. Digital transformation with the help of industrial Internet platform has become a trend. For this reason, this study deeply explores the influence mechanism of digitalization collaboration of manufacturing enterprises under the empowerment of industrial Internet platform. This paper constructs a stochastic evolutionary game model with core manufacturing enterprise, supplier and local government as the main players. Consider stochastic differential equations to analyze the stability conditions of game subjects, and explore different incentive mechanisms on enterprise strategy. The results show that the data security of the platform and the network effect coefficients significantly affect the strategy selection results of the players. Additionally, the change of environmental noise affects the strategy evolution process of the subject, and the supplier strategy is more affected by environmental noise compared to the core manufacturing enterprises. Furthermore, the dynamic incentive effect of the government is better than the static incentive, which can better promote the digital collaboration of manufacturing enterprises. Dynamic penalties are less effective than static penalties. The study’s conclusions can provide a reference for the government to implement the gradient digitalization incentive policy and provide a theoretical basis for promoting digital collaboration in manufacturing enterprises.}

Design thinking practices have emerged as a prominent problem-solving approach offering innovation benefits during high uncertainties. However, in the context of high-tech ventures, more research is needed on linking the relationship between design thinking principles, innovation theories (effectuation and causation), and firm performance. The present study investigates how the design thinking principles influence innovation theories and whether it leads to improved high-tech venture performance. Based on a survey of 291 platform-based start-ups in India, the results show that design thinking ways are well integrated into the theories of effectuation and causation, facilitating the growth of platform-based ventures. However, the influence of effectuation and causation on platform-based venture performance is found to be mediated through the digital capabilities acquired by these ventures.}

The pharmaceutical supply chain processes are considered as the mediators and the emerging technology adoption barriers are proposed as the moderators. The study is evaluated using a survey of pharmaceutical companies in India. The findings indicate that manufacturing, distribution and consumption processes in the supply chain mediate the effects of emerging technologies on supply chain performance; however, mediating effects are weakened due to the presence of intricate barriers.

In this paper, we develop an understanding of AI readiness and adoption through a fuller appreciation of micro- and meso-empirical data that delineates the determinants of AI readiness and uncovers a set of strategic components that can help AgriTech firms better manage the readiness process for AI adoption. To do this, we employ a mixed-methods approach and elicit data from 236 e-surveys and 25 interviews from an important conference in the AgriTech field. Our findings have implications for research and practice to understand AI technological readiness.}

We propose a framework incorporating news sentiment and topics into the M&A target prediction model, utilising state-of-the-art transformer-based sentiment analysis and topic modelling approaches. We evaluate the textual features' predictive power using a real-world dataset of US and UK target and non-target companies from 2020 to 2021, with several experiments conducted to reveal the contribution of sentiment and thematic focus of news to M&A target prediction. A profit-based objective function is proposed to overcome the inherent class imbalance problem in the dataset. Our findings suggest that news-based prediction models outperform traditional statistical and single machine learning methods, indicating the need for more robust and less prone to overfitting ensemble learning methods. Additionally, our study provides evidence for the positive effect of news-based negative sentiment on the likelihood of M&A.

In this study, SE organizations are defined as all commercial or non-commercial product-service systems that capture and redistribute idle resources or assets in crowd-based networks through true sharing, pseudo-sharing, or collaborative consumption, and that use mediation platforms, that are most often electronic and accessible via the internet, to promote an efficient use of resources and value creation. Our findings, based on a framework for mapping types of innovation, suggest that previous studies focus mostly on how the business models of SE organizations impact cities and urban areas and contribute to sustainability. Moreover, process innovation and position innovation are the types of innovation most reported in the SE literature. The results show that the engagement of new social actors in innovation activities is essential in the SE. Some emerging topics for future research in the SE field include the co-creation of product innovation, network-based process innovation, technology-based service position innovation, and evasive innovation.}

In the meantime, ad-fraud undertaken by cybercriminals cost $42 billion in 2019 and could reach $100 billion by 2023. However, while digital advertisers continue to wrestle with how to effectively counteract ad-fraud, the topic of advertising fraud itself has received little academic attention. Here, we investigate this gap between practice and research through an exploration of ad-fraud communities. Our research implemented a multimethod approach for data collection in a longitudinal (18 months, October 2017 to April 2019) online investigation of this phenomenon. Integrating qualitative and quantitative analysis, we examined (1) internal interactions within ad-fraud communities and (2) ad-fraud communities’ performance and growth. Our online investigation extends our conceptual understanding of ad-fraud and explains how ad-fraud communities innovate. Our findings indicate that capabilities enacted by some communities foster requisite variety and enable the coordination of complex, iterative, and incremental dynamics (cocreation of artificial intelligence-based bots, customer involvement, and reinforcing capabilities). This research has both theoretical and practical implications for innovation in cybercriminal communities. Furthermore, we provide practical guidance for policy-makers and advertisers regarding how to improve their response to business threats. Indeed, a better understanding of how ad-fraud communities innovate enables organizations to develop countermeasures and intelligence capabilities.}

abstract = {The circular supply chain (CSC) paradigm advocates a shift in business practices from linear to circular models for the planet’s sustainability. CSC involves recovery processes that result in capturing additional value and reduction of carbon footprints in the supply chain. Industry 5.0 (I5.0) revolution involves a network of connected devices and systems across the supply chain to facilitate intelligent manufacturing as per customer-specific requirements. It can be an enabling tool for achieving sustainability via a circular economy. In the existing literature, there is an absence of a framework connecting the drivers of I5.0 and CSC. The present study identifies 16 potential drivers in the context of achieving I5.0 and CSC synergy from the literature review and in consultation with industry professionals and practitioners. To identify the criticality strength of drivers, a mixed model is constructed using the modified Total Interpretive Structure Model (m-TISM) and the Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC). The m-TISM arranges the binary interactions between the drivers, while MICMAC arranges the precise evaluations specific to the dependence and driving power of the drivers. The exercise results in a framework for handling efficiently the drivers of I5.0 and CSC to attain sustainable development. The results from the study reflect that ‘Management support for CSC and I5.0 transformation’ and ‘Organization readiness and expectation in the transformation to CSC and I5.0′ are the drivers with maximum driving power and hence should be given high priority in designing the implementation plan. Also, the driving element ‘Attitudinal transition of consumers towards CSC and I5.0 models’ is among the top-level drivers in the analysis, indicating the importance of creating awareness and attitude building in realizing this business process change. In the current global business environment of high competition and sustainability pressure, the study provides guidelines to company directors and supply chain strategists in achieving efficiency and sustainability objectives via I5.0 and CSC approaches. The proposed framework could also assist the various government and industry associations in formulating policies for I5.0, CSC and sustainable development.}

That is, their future responsibilities and skills are likely to change. Introducing the concept of specialized roles to summarize needed competencies, this research conducted a real-time Delphi study using an internet-based platform involving 47 procurement experts. As a result, the roles of the Data Analyst, Master Data Manager, Process Automation Manager, Supplier Onboarding Manager, System Innovation Scout, and Legislation Specialist were identified as essential Industry 4.0 PSM roles. For these roles, the probability of their occurrence, industry impact, desirability, and level of industry adoption are assessed. Based on emerging technologies in PSM and adopting a human-centered perspective, this research shows the need to focus on talent development to enable a technology-driven revolution. Thus, the contributions lay in the literature on Industry 4.0 and the PSM skills and capabilities domain, highlighting the required roles for Smart Working and effective Smart Supply Chains management as parts of the digital transformation journey.}

For this reason, the paper explores the effects of Industry 4.0 on the sustainable economy for 20 OECD countries for the period [2011–2021]. To do this, We utilize several variables to represent Industry 4.0 technologies. These include ICT patents, reflecting a high level of interconnectedness; environmental patents, demonstrating the green aspect of Industry 4.0; AI patents, which form the core of digitalization strategies due to their capacity for automation and operational visibility; and high-technology exports, signifying a country's advancement in the technology market. The main findings reveal a positive and significant impact of environmental patents and the number of researchers on economic growth and renewable energy consumption, while ICT patents and AI patents have a negative effect on the employment rate.}

Focusing on a three-player supply chain consisting of a government, a manufacturer and a retailer, the paper investigates the optimal production and subsidy rate of the supply chain considering consumer environmental awareness (CEA) is dynamic. The paper develops a differential game based model to explore the optimal production and subsidy rate considering government’s different goals of social welfare maximization and governmental utility maximization. Our study shows that the subsidy rate increases with the CEA under social welfare orientation but decreases with the CEA under governmental utility orientation. Moreover, we find that the subsidy policy under governmental utility orientation can target more consumer groups compared to the subsidy policy under social welfare orientation. The social welfare under the social welfare orientation is always negative, while governmental utility under governmental utility orientation is positive in some cases. However, under governmental utility orientation, the profit of the centralized supply chain is lower than that of the decentralized supply chain. Further, the limited subsidy under governmental utility orientation can avoid this disadvantage while achieving improvement in green quality.}

However, this paper presents a critical view, arguing that the success of a nudge is significantly influenced by a specific context, challenging the notion of it being a universal solution for organizational behavior modification. This paper highlights three primary concerns: the absence of a comprehensive behavioral change framework; an overemphasis on immediate effects and ad hoc successes at the expense of changing deep-seated motivations, decision-making capabilities, or organizational processes; and a tendency among managers to rely on anecdotal beliefs rather than robust evidence. The paper offers a framework for understanding these challenges and proposes organizational policies (training of managers and continuous organizational experimentation) to implement effective nudging strategies. This framework’s validity is supported by evidence from semi-structured interviews and focus group with industry professionals.}

abstract = {Scholars have explored the applicability of social media technology in diverse fields. However, its significance as a delivery tool in the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) motorcycle industry lacks literature. Motorcycles for product delivery are one of SSA's largest informal employments to generational cohorts. Motorcycles are crucial for product mobility and passenger conveyance in SSA, and it is currently the most outsourced logistics that drive the SSA online commerce ecosystem. With the financial challenges of the SSA motorcycle industry, generational cohorts of this economic sector have adopted social media technology for delivery purposes. Even though this phenomenon is realized among the predominated Generation (Gen) X, Y, and Z, no research has explored the area. However, motorcycle studies are based on actors, organizations, politics, forms of service regulation, safety, health, environmental impacts, and spatial patterns, creating a significant gap in social media adoption, usage, and importance. Therefore, the study aims to assess the effects of the factors influencing the recent adoption of social media technology for delivery operations and the difference in social media acceptance and application between Gen X, Y, and Z in the SSA motorcycle industry using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The novel findings show the theoretical extension of the adopted theories by introducing cohorts' technical know-how (TKH), which positively influences cohorts' social media adoption and application. It also confirms the differences in generational cohorts' technology intelligence and acceptance. Generally, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and attitude influence generational cohorts to adopt social media for delivery purposes. Cohorts' perceived risk was insignificant, and the predictors of the TAM and TPB model partially mediate the positive relationship between TKH and intention to use social media as a delivery tool. The study's findings have theoretical and business implications, which are discussed in detail in the conclusion. But generally, the findings will service as a guide for logistics companies to integrate a cost-effective technology into their system. It will help policymakers of the various African states to revise the ban on motorcycle usage for commercial purposes.}

Based on the exploratory case studies of 5 Finnish high-tech SMEs, we find that the case SMEs enacted different processes and utilized resources and capabilities creatively to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and leverage it as an opportunity. Findings indicate that agile adaptation and new opportunity utilization were the primary means of dealing with the disruptions the COVID-19 pandemic brought about. These findings indicate effective utilization of sensing and seizing capabilities and engagement with opportunity recognition and discovery to capture opportunities and deal with the impact of the pandemic on their businesses. The results further suggest that the outbreak of COVID-19 triggered a fight-or-flight survival instinct among B2B SMEs due to unprecedented levels of market uncertainty. As such, the sensing capability of B2B SMEs allowed them to identify the market threats and opportunities and understand the prevailing market situation. Accordingly, B2B SMEs seized the identified threats and opportunities by reconfiguring their business models and face-to-face and online operations. The digital technologies facilitated the online presence and promoted communication with existing and new customers. Interesting implications emerge from these findings.}

To understand how small and medium-sized firms have utilised Gen AI-based tools to cope with the market's high level of turbulence caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical crises, and economic slowdown, researchers have conducted an empirical study. Although Gen AI is receiving more attention, there remains a dearth of empirical studies that investigate how it influences the entrepreneurial orientation of firms and their ability to cultivate entrepreneurial resilience amidst market turbulence. Most of the literature offers anecdotal evidence. To address this research gap, the authors have grounded their theoretical model and research hypotheses in the contingent view of dynamic capability. They tested the research hypotheses using cross-sectional data from a pre-tested survey instrument, which yielded 87 useable responses from small and medium enterprises in France. The authors used variance-based structural equation modelling with the commercial WarpPLS 7.0 software to test the theoretical model. The study's findings suggest that Gen AI and EO have a significant influence on building entrepreneurial resilience as higher-order and lower-order dynamic capabilities. However, market turbulence has a negative moderating effect on the path that joins entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial resilience. The results suggest that the assumption that high market turbulence will have positive effects on dynamic capabilities and competitive advantage is not always true, and the linear assumption does not hold, which is consistent with some scholars' assumptions. The study's results offer significant contributions to the contingent view of dynamic capabilities and open new research avenues that require further investigation into the non-linear relationship of market turbulence.}

While an open business model focuses mainly on searching and integrating external knowledge to address key aspects of a firm's value proposition and offerings, an ecosystem-based business model refers to how a firm adjusts the critical components of its business model according to its position, role, and links in the ecosystem. However, an ecosystem business model involves activities and offerings from ecosystem actors that should be aligned to materialize a general value proposition. This platformization requires a profound yet little understood view on how firms transform business models through cognitive and managerial processes. To address this research gap, we employ a multiple-case study approach in four large firms. This study identifies a new business model transformation process consisting of three phases: 1) broadening view, 2) integrating, and 3) orchestrating. Our findings contribute to the literature by demonstrating the unique cognitive and managerial processes related to shaping the emergence of the ecosystem business model while simultaneously transforming the firm's business model to operate in ecosystems.}

abstract = {This paper proposes that institutional investor ESG activism affects corporate green innovation through two attention mechanisms: intra-firm allocation of attention and inter-firm integration of attention. Using the attention-based view within an agency framework, we explore the moderating roles of media coverage and industrial chain relatedness in attention mechanisms, and whether such moderating effects differ in digital and non-digital firms. Using a dataset of 2726 Chinese listed firms from 2007 to 2021, we find that ESG activism by institutional investors enhances corporate green innovation, and media coverage strengthens this positive linkage. The positive moderating role of media coverage is more impactful in digital firms than in non-digital firms. An unexpected finding is that industrial chain relatedness negatively moderates the influence of ESG activism on green innovation, but this negative moderation is alleviated in digital firms. These findings provide novel implications for firms as they address agency conflicts through shareholder activism and advance green innovation in the digital era.}

This study seeks to thoroughly understand the organizational context in which Artificial Intelligence (AI) would be implemented, through a systematic review and analysis of articles published (up to 2021) in 31 journals on information systems, business, management, and operations management. Seventy themes are identified from the literature and categorized into organizational, information systems, technological, and people dimensions for the antecedents, challenges, guidelines, and consequences of AI implementation in organizations. A conceptual framework for understanding AI implementation in organizations is also proposed. This study provides a research agenda to guide future research and facilitate knowledge accumulation and creation on AI implementation.}

To develop a thorough understanding of DI research domain and its themes, establishing a coherent overview of the theoretical intellectual structures in the DI literature is of utmost importance. In academia, DI has garnered considerable attention across a broad spectrum of literatures, creating a fragmented body of relevant literatures that must be consolidated. To achieve our objectives, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of 647 qualified articles published between 2000 and 2020 to identify the most significant building blocks (innovation structure, innovation technology, and innovation strategy) in the DI literature through key co-occurrence and co-citation analyses using the CiteSpace software. This analysis was followed by a systematic literature review of the 123 most influential articles, elaborating on the relationships between the hot topics within each block and elucidating how each block influences the others, to offer a comprehensive understanding of DI research. Through our study, we identified areas for further exploration and demonstrated how bibliometric and systematic literature review can be combined to provide a deeper understanding of complex fields of research.}

The empirical evidence collected from interviews with key stakeholders, practitioners’ forums, and public company documents yields two distinct approaches that differ in their potential for accelerating innovation and reducing the concept-product gap. From a contingency perspective, these two approaches are expanded into four distinct development process configurations, contingent on the business development stage, reliance on 3rd party platforms, availability of high volumes of data, investment level, organisational agility, and level of novelty. The resulting process typology could be used as a diagnostic tool for FinTech SMEs interested in effectively leveraging AI innovation. Using contingency theory, we further develop these insights into a new theoretical framework to explain how AI innovation development unfolds in FinTech SMEs and the rationale for different implementations. Our new process typology and theoretical model can help researchers investigate the mechanisms underlying technological innovation processes. We further identify the specific reasons why the potential of AI for creating new services and disrupting incumbents via digital startups has not been fully realised even in contexts with significant investment and support from public and private business development programmes. This field is still rapidly evolving, and thus, new areas for future research are also highlighted.}

Specifically, we examine (1) contact frequency between customers and service robots, (2) interdependence among service robots and human service employees, and (3) service complexity, moderate the relationship between service robots' capabilities and customer acceptance. With data collected from 997 customers who have past experience with service robots, we found that the effect of functional and social-emotional capabilities of service robots on customer acceptance are more salient when contact frequency is low rather than high, interdependence among service robots and service employees is high rather than low, and service complexity is low rather than high.

By integrating dynamic capability theory into business model research, we empirically investigate the influence of BMD on innovation performance. Based on the matched survey data and the objective performance data of 282 Chinese high-tech firms, we employed bootstrap tests to estimate the mediating effects of product innovation capability (PIC) and used hierarchical regression analysis to estimate the moderating effects of technological turbulence. The results show that novelty-centered BMD positively relates to innovation performance and that this link is partially mediated by radical PIC and incremental PIC. In contrast, efficiency-centered BMD cannot directly impact innovation performance, but can indirectly affect it through incremental PIC. We further find that the indirect effect of novelty-centered BMD on innovation performance via incremental PIC is stronger than that of efficiency-centered BMD. In addition, technological turbulence strengthens the positive effect of novelty-centered BMD on PIC while weakening the positive impact of efficiency-centered BMD on PIC. Our study thus provides high-tech firm managers with an in-depth understanding of how and when BMD drives innovation performance.}

Additionally, human capital herein includes social factors such as social capital, which research has demonstrated can be developed from intellectual capital, and vice versa. Findings from an experiment with 40 professional investors (resulting in 160 independent observations) suggested that belonging to a company's collaborative networks—where they would gain access to IA performance information—led them to adjust their investment risk assessments downward or upward in response to material weakness or strength disclosures pertaining to IA performance. Additionally, a laboratory experiment revealed that 121 novice investors who learned how to interpret and use their social networks to gain access to IA performance information also led them to adjust their investment risk assessments in response to material IA information deficiencies in target companies. The results showed IA knowledge can be learned and transferred to impact social change.}

Organizations do not want to compromise their ethical standards and compliance policies. Against this backdrop, the aim of this study is to examine if GenAI technology could improve the future performance of the organizations. This study deployed ethical dilemmas and environmental dynamism as two moderators acting on different linkages between adoption of GenAI and organizational future performance. With the help of literature review and theories, a theoretical model has been developed conceptually which was validated using PLS-SEM technique with the feedback of 326 responses from different types of organizations. This study found that the adoption of GenAI could improve exploratory and exploitative innovation under the moderating effects of environmental dynamism and ethical dilemmas. Moreover, it highlighted that the application of GenAI could improve organizational performance.}

The findings suggest that AI orientation promotes corporate climate actions, and that higher innovation capability reinforces this effect.

More precise definitions result from cascading down the meaning of the dimensions into the descriptors, from complex to simple concepts. Grouping the descriptors allows for more concise explanations without loss of precision. A unified definition establishes the body of knowledge of the discipline and advances business and science. It also supports the establishment of the CI profession and professional identity and serves as a guide for the effective establishment of the CI function. The development of CI theory has a significant impact on CI culture and may enable the society to address one of the greatest current challenges, information overload. CI education can only thrive if a clear definition and understanding is possible.}

abstract = {The literature on servitization and product-service systems calls for more robust evidence and theory regarding the concept of “sustainable servitization”, and how it balances sustainability, profits, and servitization. This study interprets sustainable servitization as an interaction of sustainability and servitization, investigating how servitization moderates the complex relationship between strategic emphasis on sustainability and company profitability. Using Computer-aided Text Analysis (CATA) augmented by machine learning, this study analyzes the annual reports of U.S. manufacturing companies from 1993 to 2019. The study uses objective profitability measures and longitudinal panel data. As the first contribution, the results show a negative direct relationship between manufacturing firms’ sustainability emphasis and firm profitability. As the second and primary contribution, the results demonstrate a positive moderating effect of servitization, with two inflection points, on the relationship between manufacturing firms’ sustainability emphasis and company profitability. This paper contributes to the literature by introducing the concept of sustainable servitization, discussing the interplay between sustainability emphasis and servitization and its effect on firm profitability in manufacturing firms’ transition toward sustainable business models. The present study is one of the first demonstrating the direct negative impact of sustainability emphasis on company profitability and the positive moderating role of servitization, highlighting the concept of sustainable servitization while cautioning about the sustainable servitization paradox in the context of manufacturing companies. For managers, the study demonstrates the importance of servitization in creating profits from sustainability initiatives. Value creation from sustainability strategies requires capability development from manufacturing firms.}

To address this gap, this study employs a multiple case study approach to uncover the varied processes and outcomes of implementing digital diversification programs in established firms. The findings reveal that established firms frequently refine and adjust their digital diversification strategies to achieve desired results. Specifically, related digital diversification strategies benefit from well-defined market segments, clear technological focus, and robust senior management support. In contrast, unrelated digital diversification strategies thrive through extensive exploration and experimentation with novel digital technologies and markets, reduced senior managerial intervention and increased middle- and lower-level management involvement. Semi-related digital diversification strategies, which incorporate elements of both related and unrelated approaches, often encounter tensions owing to conflicting traditional and new program execution methods, posing significant realization challenges. Key factors identified as instrumental in the success of digital diversification strategies include technology, markets, management & organization, and program execution. The study concludes by discussing the managerial and academic implications and offers recommendations for future research in this domain.}

With the objective to assess the quality and adoptability of education supply chain, a novel analytical evaluation model approach is proposed, based on quality function deployment and combinative distance-based assessment. To deal with uncertainty in the evaluation process, fuzzy theory is integrated into the model. To establish the house of quality matrix, technology-based stakeholders' requirements were identified and classified in four dimensions: economic and financial, technology adoption, sustainability, competencies. Moreover, nine supplier criteria were assumed. Based on expert evaluations, the results suggest that financial credit and supplier collaboration are the most prominent attributes to evaluate suppliers, while environmental commitment is sorted as the least important criterion. The results reveal that the three dominant suppliers, which provide the best response to the identified criteria, are providers of cloud service technology.}

Accordingly, we develop a model of AI integration based on Socio-Technical Systems (STS) theory that combines AI novelty and scope dimensions. We take an organizational socialization approach to build an understanding of the process of integrating AI into the organization. Our framework underscores the importance of AI socialization as a core process in successfully integrating AI systems and employees.

Despite the many benefits of unmanned convenience stores, consumers must inevitably shoulder the uncertainty that personal privacy information may be exposed through such smart technology. To address this heightened privacy concern, we adopted trust-based privacy protection model within the classic framework of information systems success in this study. To be specific, we explore how the information systems success qualities of unmanned convenience stores affect consumers' trust-based privacy protection, subsequently impacting consumer satisfaction, loyalty, and behavioral intention while considering the moderating effect of gender and emperience. In this study, we used 480 out of 525 responses to conduct path analysis using structural equation model. Our sample is drawn from respondents who have experienced major unmanned convenience stores in China. Our findings confirm that the information systems success qualities of unmanned convenience stores enhance trust-based privacy protection, leading to increased consumer satisfaction, loyalty, and behavioral intention, while gender and experience also play a significant role in the void between theories.}

Among these orchestration practices, some aim at bringing actors together, while others seek to align the behaviours of different actors. Yet, to date, the literature has paid limited attention to this specific subset of orchestration activities. This study proposes to look at those precise activities that seek to strengthen common norms between business actors. Our work draws on an in-depth abductive study based on 54 interviews with different actors of a distribution network. First, the findings reveal the existence of four common norms among the network actors. Second, they illustrate the specific roles played by distributors regarding the strengthening of those common norms.

Thus, the current study tests a moderated mediated model that investigates how perceived socio-technical congruence by partnering organisations enhances the effect of interorganisational information systems integration on forecasting information quality and market responsiveness. Using absorptive capacity and socio-technical congruence theory, first, the study examines the mediating role of forecast information quality on the relationship between interorganisational information systems integration and market responsiveness. Second, the study examines the moderating role of perceived socio-technical congruence. SPSS-PROCESS model was used for the analysis. The study contributes to knowledge by extending the applicability of socio-technical congruence theory to information systems and forecasting literature in inter-organisational context. The study points to the need for high levels of socio-technical congruence between partnering organisations to maximise the benefits accruing from interorganisational information systems integration.}

Updating a portfolio of AI applications relates to a firm's dynamic capability to respond to the changes of the market. We propose a set of four hypotheses in which the impact of updating the portfolio of AI applications on firm performance is mediated by business process agility. Additionally, we suggest that building explainability into the portfolio of AI applications when firms update their portfolio acts as a moderator to generate greater agility, which in return improves overall firm performance. Data from a survey of IT executives were analyzed to validate our proposed hypotheses. The results from the survey were also evaluated by a qualitative focus group session. This research is a significant contribution to the emerging literature on dynamic capabilities as it presents and tests a theory regarding the influence of the firm capability to update the portfolio of AI applications on agility and firm performance and the role of explainable AI.}

The modeling results show that platform economy improves enterprise value, as supported by the positive value of the regression coefficient. The positive impact was mediated by the technological innovation ability of the enterprises, with a mediating effect of 27.30%. The heterogeneity test results show that platform economy positively impacts the enterprise value of state-owned and non-state-owned enterprises, where the impact is more significant in the former.

Unfortunately, we also observe a hype where the models’ business deployability is reduced to simplistic technical metrics, namely, the model’s prediction accuracy. This study argues that this is a misleading oversimplification of the financial sector’s business realities as it ignores vital dimensions such as the model’s economic viability. Therefore, we develop a framework for evaluating the business deployability of UGDF models for consumer credit using a design science research methodology.

The web-based development of technology and the digital transformation needs of multidisciplinary markets simultaneously drive the increasing convergence and expansibility of information technology (IT). However, whether these two technological characteristics can contribute to the diffusion of early-stage IT and how they influence the further diffusion of IT that has already diffused on a large scale are yet to be thoroughly investigated. We argue that the impact of technology convergence on ITD is heterogeneous when distinguishing between low- and high-ITD scenarios, as is technology expansibility. Our quantile regression estimates use a dataset about Internet of Things (IoT) patents authorized by the Chinese Patent Office from 2009 to 2019. The results show that increased technology convergence benefits ITD in high-ITD scenarios but does not affect ITD in low-ITD scenarios. Technology expansibility negatively impacts ITD in high-ITD scenarios and positively impacts ITD in low-ITD scenarios. This study broadens the theoretical paradigm of “technological characteristics and ITD” from the domain perspective. It inspires information technology owners to formulate sustainable strategies related to ITD according to technology convergence and expansibility.}

abstract = {This study develops a technology and social capital process aided product innovation conceptual model based on dynamic capability and supply chain ambidexterity theory. The strategy of organisational ambidexterity in balancing technological and relational social capital factors between buyers and suppliers leads to a higher level of digital manufacturing capabilities and enhances buyers’ innovation potential, considering the sustainable practices in their processes to cope with Industry 4.0 manufacturing processes and sustainability challenges. The study empirically validates the model using data collected from 379 French manufacturing companies. This is the first study that examines how buyers perceive the role of blockchain technology in exploring and exploiting innovation management in the Industry 4.0 era. The study advances understanding on the theory of ambidexterity of supply chains in buyer–supplier relationships. The study results show the positive effect between internal integration and blockchain technology as well as relational social capital factors in buyer–supplier relationships. The findings underscore the critical role of relational and technological capital in buyer–supplier relationships, specifically to act as a catalyst for exploiting internal capabilities to achieve the innovation targets. The unique findings state blockchain technology mediation is dominant in exploiting the internal capabilities and benefits buyers' innovation orientation.}

The analysis input was represented by annual data from the EU from 2013 to 2021, and the indicators of the e-commerce companies (where B2C, B2B, and B2G represent one variable) were classified according to company size. Twelve e-commerce indicators were analyzed in total. The panel regression analysis confirmed that a higher rate of innovation is associated with a higher rate of e-commerce, which, in turn, is associated with a higher rate of economic development in countries. Most of the relationships explored were confirmed. Nevertheless, when specifying them, it is necessary to consider the specifics of B2C and B2B with B2G. The the cluster analysis demonstrated that Bulgaria and Romania are among the countries that should pay more attention to this issue.}

Although previous research has explored the impact of consumers' story plots, elements, types, and endings on story effectiveness, the connection between the audience and story protagonist is often of greater concern to consumers. This study examines how the geographical distance between audiences and consumers' story protagonists can prompt audiences to share a consumers' story. A dataset was collected from leading social platforms, and four scenario–based experiments were conducted, which demonstrated that the geographical distance between the protagonist and audience enhanced audience–protagonist similarity and interpersonal identity leading to a more positive willingness to share the story. Additionally, the effect of geographical distance on willingness to share is stronger when the story is based on true events; this effect is attenuated when the story is fictitious. The findings provide a proximal protagonist that advertisers can use in a story to prompt audiences to share consumers’ stories.}

Yet, despite this relationship, a lack of coherence and clarity around the input of technology for ASC has impeded to portray accurately the relative importance of digitization in ASC strategies. This study provides a comprehensive and integrative review of 90 articles on ASC. By so doing, we contribute to the discussion about digitization in the supply chain in several ways. First, the paper reports descriptively and analytically how technology was addressed within the ASC literature. Second, it maps a nomological network of ASC research. Third, it finds that technology appears as a necessary but not-sufficient enabling factor for ASC deployment. Finally, a research agenda is proposed to suggest future research avenues to improve contributions to ASC performance.}

To test the proposed model, a fuzzy comparative qualitative analysis (fsQCA) is employed, and different causal configurations are analyzed. The results show that no single condition limits the occurrence of product and process innovation. However, several causal configurations of sufficient conditions for innovation and an absence of innovation are identified.

Customer consumption is elevated when the firm successfully orchestrates its resource integration by providing better employee service, extending its business partnerships, and incorporating service innovation to improve its service delivery processes and customer database management.}

Previous studies have indicated that the anthropomorphic appearance of robots can elicit both favorable and unfavorable responses from consumers. However, the factors that moderate such responses are not well-understood. Therefore, the present research proposes that self-construal, an untapped topic, is a moderator. Long-term, frequent, and private interactions between consumers and social robots at home may result in consumers developing relationships with robots based on the trade-off between benefits and (psychological) costs. Through examining social support benefits and relational intrusion costs, three experiments and one text analysis demonstrate that independent (interdependent) self-construals prefer humanoid (mechanoid) over mechanoid (humanoid) SHRs due to the anticipation of net interaction benefits. This research contributes to the knowledge of the contradictory findings regarding highly anthropomorphic robots, explicitly enhancing the understanding of human-robot interaction, the “uncanny valley,” robot anthropomorphism, and social robotics. Moreover, this research offers a practical design approach to SHRs from a managerial perspective.}

This kind of correlation analysis of retail product sales does not reflect the information regarding the time or quantity of the sales. Product sales datasets contain rich information about the correlations between different products at different times. The co-occurrence of similar sales subsequences reveal that product sales are correlated in a specific time period. Therefore, searching for similar co-occurrence patterns can help analyze the temporary correlations between products. The search for similar subsequences can be viewed as motif discovery in time-series datasets. In the field of motif discovery, the matrix profile (MP) provides an overwhelming advantage in detecting motifs. In this study, our aim is to discover motifs using MP, and hence, analyze the temporary sales correlations between products. The results of our numerical experiments indicate what products customers will purchase at what time. As opposed to strong association rules, we name the correlation rules in this work as temporary rules (TRs). Our results also show that customers’ preferences are not stable and change with time. In the retail industry, TRs can help business owners make suitable product promotions at appropriate times. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that TRs can extract more interesting information and patterns than mining with association rules.}

Thus, we analyzed the evolution and utilization of contactless services during the three different time periods: pre-, during-, and post-COVID-19. The results indicated that in the post-COVID-19 era, a new normal of hybrid healthcare services would emerge. While some of the contactless services that have been practiced during the pandemic may revert to the traditional face-to-face services, those innovative contactless healthcare services that have been proven effective during the pandemic would be practiced or even advanced in the post-pandemic period due to the accelerating technological developments.

In today's digitalized world, technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart connected objects (SCOs) are moving to the forefront and have given rise to fundamental changes in consumers’ daily lives. During the context of COVID-19, the IoT and SCOs enabled people to better deal with the pandemic situation (e.g., control their health or use fitness indicators) (Gupta et al., 2021). The purpose of this study is to explain the acceptance and usage of SCOs and therefore extend the technology acceptance model (TAM; Davis, 1989) with other theories (i.e., uses and gratification, diffusion of innovation, privacy calculus), and thus new antecedents adapted to the SCO context. More specifically, in addition to the TAM's main variables (i.e., perceived usefulness, ease of use, intention to use, real use), we investigate the roles of concepts rarely investigated in innovation and new technology research, such as well-being, social image, privacy concerns, and innovativeness. We also study the differences in the adoption of SCOs between different user adoption stages, such as the early adopters, early majority, and late majority (Rogers, 1983). The data come from 702 respondents surveyed in a longitudinal study over three years of their acceptance and real usage. Structural equation modeling shows that the TAM variables remain relevant in the SCO context. The results show that utilitarian benefits are the main reasons leading to SCO technology acceptance, and well-being and social image lead to higher usage in the long term. However, privacy concerns are the main obstacles to the adoption of SCOs.}

abstract = {Mobile payment systems are increasingly seen as the lifeline of an economy and recognized as a harbinger of financial inclusion for the bottom of the pyramid (BoP). The present study aims to examine key antecedents of continued intention to use mobile payments by the BoP segment, which has shown increased usage of mobile payments. Whether this trend will lead to continued usage of the same is a moot point. To explore this, we collected data from 387 BoP respondents (auto drivers, cab drivers, local food vendors, street vendors, and others) and analyzed the data using structural equation modeling (SEM). Following the attribute-consequence-value approach of mean end theory (ACVMET), an empirical model is employed to test the effect of perceived value and service quality on continuance intention. We also examine the influence of perceived risk as a moderator in the relationship. Findings suggest that service quality is influenced by attribute-based variables that impact perceived value and continuance intention. The significant moderating role of perceived risk is also confirmed. The implications of the study for mobile payment service providers have been discussed.}

Complex challenges, such as sustainability and digitization trends, push these B2B firms to embrace new innovation methods that help them manage disruptive change. Service design thinking has emerged as an innovation management practice emphasizing a human-centered innovation process of user interactions, creativity, and learning mindsets. In this article, we aim to evaluate the challenges and develop a research agenda on how service design can effectively enable stakeholders' engagement during the B2B innovation process. We argue that to advance service design opportunities for stakeholder engagement, we need to address the unique complexities and challenges of stakeholder engagement during innovation from a systemic and dynamic process perspective. From a systemic perspective, we zoom in on the building blocks of stakeholder engagement and address multi-level stakeholder engagement platforms (i.e., innovation networks). From a dynamic process perspective, we treat stakeholder engagement as an emerging process and zoom in on the temporal and relational connections and hybrid orchestration to allow for both structural and emerging stakeholder engagement during innovation. We develop a stakeholder engagement journey in which we integrate service and innovation stages and propose how service design activities can support and facilitate the aforementioned challenges and complexities. Finally, we identify concrete research questions and, accordingly, develop a research agenda for future research on stakeholder engagement in B2B innovation trajectories.}

This research investigates the value of official website information in the credit risk evaluation of SMEs. To study the effect of different kinds of website information on credit risk evaluation, we propose a framework to mine effective features from two kinds of information disclosed on the official website of a SME—design-based information and content-based information—in predicting its credit risk. We select the SMEs in the software and information technology services industry and find that including content-based information in models significantly improves the prediction accuracy. Specifically, the depth and dynamics metrics of the content-based information convey SME performance and mitigate the information asymmetry between SMEs and financial institutions.}

Although several research studies have been carried out to analyze consumers' satisfaction using survey-based methodologies, consumers' satisfaction has not been well explored in the event of the COVID-19 crisis, especially using available data in social network sites. In this research, we aim to explore consumers' satisfaction and preferences of restaurants' services during the COVID-19 crisis. Furthermore, we investigate the moderating impact of COVID-19 safety precautions on restaurants' quality dimensions and satisfaction. We applied a new approach to achieve the objectives of this research. We first developed a hybrid approach using clustering, supervised learning, and text mining techniques. Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) was used to cluster customers' preferences. To predict travelers' preferences, decision trees were applied to each segment of LVQ. We used a text mining technique; Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), for textual data analysis to discover the satisfaction criteria from online customers' reviews. After analyzing the data using machine learning techniques, a theoretical model was developed to inspect the relationships between the restaurants’ quality factors and customers' satisfaction. In this stage, Partial Least Squares (PLS) technique was employed. We evaluated the proposed approach using a dataset collected from the TripAdvisor platform. The outcomes of the two-stage methodology were discussed and future research directions were suggested according to the limitations of this study.}

Strategy D(S) means that the manufacturer and retailer set different(same) retail prices for online and offline channels in the two sales periods. The main purposes of this research are to identify the manufacturer’s and the retailer’s optimal two-period pricing strategy and explore how consumers’ channel preference, price competition, and market change affect the strategy equilibrium. We derive and compare the equilibrium outcomes by establishing four game models: (1) Model SS, both the manufacturer and retailer adopt Strategy S; (2) Model SD, the manufacturer chooses Strategy S while the retailer selects Strategy D; (3) Model DS, the manufacturer chooses Strategy D while the retailer selects Strategy S; (4) Model DD, both choose Strategy D. The research findings demonstrate that most prices increase as the market change rate raises, except for the first-period prices under Model DD, which remain unchanged. Under the different prices settings, a shrinking market would impel supply chain members to utilize a skimming pricing strategy, while a growing market drives them to select a penetration pricing strategy. Different from traditional wisdom, Strategy D would always benefit the manufacturer, while it may hurt the retailer and the whole supply chain under certain conditions. Accordingly, either Strategy DS or DD may be the Nash equilibrium. After considering the consumers’ channel switching behavior, the retailer has more incentive to adopt Strategy S in a shrinking market.}

A machine learning model for predicting the success of a firm was developed, incorporating industry characteristics. Data were collected from 218,207 companies in Crunchbase from January 2011 to July 2021. After data preprocessing, six machine learning models were used to predict startup success and identify features significant for the prediction. Feature importance was also calculated to determine how each feature affects startup success prediction. The results indicate that media exposure, monetary funding, industry convergence level, and industry association level are significant for determining startup success.}

Motivated by the large volume of literature, this study makes a tertiary review of Industry 4.0 (i4.0), identifying the main concepts, methods, and technologies. The study is guided by three research questions: What are the literature reviews on i4.0? What are the research questions of these reviews? What are the main results of i4.0 reviews? The reviewed articles are systematic review articles indexed in the Scopus and Web of Science databases. This study presents a descriptive analysis of the review articles (46 articles) and a second descriptive analysis of the references cited in them (1542 articles). In content analysis, we grouped the articles into three classes: conceptual articles, articles on enabling technologies, and articles that address operations management in i4.0. The reviewed articles show the multidisciplinary nature of the topic and the still relative scarcity of studies on its application in companies.}

Consequently, the novel concept emerges of innovation that maintains sustainable growth by harnessing the vigor of soft innovation resources (SIRs). Pioneering endeavors can be observed at the forefront of the global ICT leaders. World R&D leader Amazon has been harnessing the power of users that seek SIRs. This functions as a virtuous cycle, leading to the transformation of R&D by fusing a unique R&D system with a sophisticated financing system. With this orchestration, Amazon leverages the expectations of a wide range of stakeholders, and takes the initiative of stakeholder capitalism in which stakeholders bet on Amazon's prospecting future. This paper attempts to elucidate the driving force of this notable accomplishment, taking Amazon's recent challenge in developing advanced digital fashions (ADFs) successively as prospecting SIRs. Since fashion reflects the change in socio-economic and cultural life, the fashion industry is in the midst of dynamic global change in the digital economy, which necessitates a digital solution. Based on a co-evolution analysis of the development trajectories of Amazon and the fashion industry, it was demonstrated that Amazon has secured a digital solution by developing ADFs successively, and that this success can be attributed to learning orchestration externality. Thus, broad stakeholders’ involvement betting on its challenge, expecting the future prospects of Amazon and the fashion industry, can be expected. Non-contact society accelerates this expectation toward on-demand ADFs manufacturing. These findings give rise to suggestions regarding a new concept of R&D and subsequent neo -open innovation in the digital economy.}

These studies have also found that dependency on partners increases when supply materials are scarce. However, research is scant on how this relationship changes in the face of exogenous forces such as the COVID-19 pandemic, keeping in mind the ethical perception considerations. This study aims to bridge this gap in the literature by studying how buyers and sellers leverage collaboration and resource-sharing to tide over pandemic-like situations similar to the current COVID-19 pandemic while considering their ethical perceptions. We conduct a multi-methodological study consisting of an industrial survey and an interview-based thematic analysis. In the first phase, we collect primary data using a structured questionnaire and conduct a covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) analysis. In the second phase, we conduct a post-hoc test. We find that non-regular suppliers will share strategic resources with buyers during uncertain times (e.g. COVID-19 pandemic) if they have a high ethical perception of the buying firm and share a candid relationship despite being their irregular customers. Our findings propose that B2B firms should maintain healthy relationships with alternative suppliers to build trust and avoid supply crises in times of disruptions.}

abstract = {The role of organizational leaders has transitioned over time, from being supervisory to strategic. This trend has been reflected in the literature, with research related to strategic leadership has risen swiftly in quantity but distributed across divergent academic fields. With increased automation and the move to a digital economy, organizational resources' leadership and strategic use are of critical significance. Hence, it is an appropriate time to put forward a wide-reaching review that identifies, summarizes, and integrates the already produced research while highlighting limitations in the field and future paths for research. We identified relevant articles published between 1985 and 2020. Applying systematic and content analysis, we highlight the core theories and methodologies used and propose a new all-encompassing strategic leadership model. This review served to identify significant gaps in the knowledge in terms of the theoretical orientation and the main content being studied.}

But what reveals the true potential of Industry 4.0 is the established connection and communication between computers and machines that allow making decisions without any human intervention. The network formed by these interconnected machines, and the generated considerable amount of data, marks the actual value of Industry 4.0. Looking at the main features of Industry 4.0, we find many similarities with blockchain technology. The key drivers for Industry 4.0 and blockchain are data management, connectivity and digitization. Additionally, decentralization and distribution are considered as shared architectural features. This paper seeks to open new horizons on the potential of blockchain technology as an empowering tool for the 4th industrial era. We are first investigating the fundamentals of Industry 4.0, its challenges, barriers and limitations, and finally exploring areas where blockchain technology can bring new features and add value to the deployment of Industry 4.0.}

In this research, the consumer's viewpoint was applied. Furthermore, the extended Push-Pull-Mooring (PPM) model was integrated into the multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) approach to investigate the elements impacting the consumers' attempt of shifting to the store-to-store pickup service developed by e-commerce platforms. Besides, the development of the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) was for the investigation into the reciprocal effects of evaluation dimensions and factors and the development of an influential network relation map (NRM). The DEMATEL-based Analytic Network Process (DANP) was used to calculate the influential weights of these dimensions and factors. It could be seen from the NRM that the first dimension that required improvement and adjustment ought to begin with a push and subsequently a pull, mooring, switching intentions, and inertia. The influential weights from the DANP highlighted inertia as the most impactful dimension, with mooring coming in second. Meanwhile, push held the lowest significance. The next discussion focuses on the theoretical, managerial and practical implications.}

To fill this gap, this paper uses computer-aided textual analysis to explore the current practices of CTTI4.0 in the UK context. It also uses quantitative analysis to examine the impact of CTTI4.0 information on financial performance. The analysis shows that strategic investment decision-making (SIDM) practices for CTTI4.0 have accelerated over the period, and these practices vary in industry sectors. Furthermore, it finds that CTTI4.0 disclosure has a positive impact on financial performance. In addition, it finds that environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices moderate the relationship between CTTI4.0 disclosure and financial performance. This indicates that firms with better ESG performance tend to be more engaged in CTTI4.0 disclosure and better financial performance simultaneously. Our findings offer insights to decision-makers and regulatory bodies regarding the current practices of CTTI4.0 and its potential economic impact. Paper type: Research paper.}

Although they are often regarded as laggards in the general progress towards adopting digital technologies, the pressure to cut costs and to review existing business models have prompted the industry forerunners within the process industries to reassess their business operations. One way to tackle this issue is to source information from the emerging startup landscape. To shed light on the importance of digitalization within the process industries, this paper provides a novel perspective using startup information. Therefore, it examines the interaction dynamics between the process industries and other industries. By centering on emerging interactions with information technology (IT)-related industries, this study further focuses on identifying the different digitalization efforts of the process industries and explores their varying degree of digital affinity. Our results indicate that not all process industries can be regarded as laggards in terms of incorporating digital capabilities. “Biotechnology”, “Pharmaceutical”, “Food and Beverage”, “Energy” and “Oil and Gas” demonstrated a higher IT-affinity, thus presenting themselves as digital leaders within the process industries. Judging from the IT-interaction preference, each segment of the process industries has adopted a unique pathway towards unlocking digital transformation opportunities.}

The study's findings show that translation plays a significant role in the process of symbiotic strategies promoting the construction of e-waste online recycling business ecosystems. This research proposes that translation is an important action for the implementation of the symbiotic strategy. The different symbiotic strategies need to be implemented in different translation ways. Platforms derived from an Internet company (PDICs), which prefer a mutualistic symbiotic strategy, usually adopt value cocreation translation through the following four steps: scenario definition, benefit sharing, emotional connection, and digital empowerment. Platforms derived from a recycling company (PDRCs)with a predatory symbiotic strategy adopt value capture translation through four steps: pain point identification, benefit allocation, the reputation effect, and rule reconstruction. We found that the difference in translation action triggers a difference in the structural elements of the business ecosystem. Then, two types of e-waste online recycling business ecosystems, embedded and central, are constructed.}

This study adopts a comparative research approach and investigates direct strategies adopted by various food supply chain actors to mitigate the impact of covid-19. This study compares how retailers Checkers, Woolworths, and Pick n Pay have adapted their business models to remain resilient during COVID-19 lockdown. The results show that the food supply chain remained resilient even with demand management challenges at the lockdown. Food supply chain issues came under a spotlight as borders and production plants were shut down or restricted to contain the spread of the virus. This study establishes that the food shortage is primarily caused by panic buying at the beginning of lockdown, causing shock in the supply chain cadence. The other aspect of food security issue is attributed to food availability and socioeconomic problems resulting from loss of income. On sustainability, there are fears that control measures such as packaging (increased use of plastic), cleaning chemicals, waste and sanitisation of space to maintain hygiene as required for covid-19 can undermine the gains towards preserving the environment.}

Based on Yelp data for restaurants in New York City, we show that a restaurant’s relatively higher popularity over its competitors increases the number of negative fake reviews it receives. The positive impact of relative popularity on negative fake reviews is weakened by the restaurant’s reputation and competitors’ popularity. The effect is weaker for chain restaurants than for independent restaurants. This study examines the generation mechanism of negative fake reviews from a competition perspective and emphasizes relative popularity as a motivator behind such reviews. Implications for review system design and restaurant management are provided.}

This dynamism also succeeded in transforming the COVID-19 pandemic period into a springboard for new innovation, leading to Amazon's notable growth notwithstanding the pandemic. An empirical analysis using a techno-economic approach focusing on Amazon's endeavor to develop a series of advanced digital fashions (ADFs) and online-based luxury brands (neo-luxury) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted. Amazon became a global apparel leader based on learning orchestration externality through developing a series of ADFs that emerged co-evolution with neo-luxury corresponding to the cultural shift to a new age of meaning. The focal driver of design-driven innovation is meaning, and meaning-seeking innovation emerges as a self-propagating generative function. Amazon has been advancing Amazon Web Services (AWS) as an innovative, advanced composite cloud infrastructure. This infrastructure incorporates a generative function and develops a cloud-based fashion platform by integrating all stakeholders in one place. Given the common key function, the self-propagating generative function, AWS, and neo-luxury resonate and induce co-evolution between them. This co-evolution emerges as growing seamless switching. Thus, a new perspective of innovation toward a non-contact society can be explored. This paper aims to reveal a theoretical and empirical demonstration of this dynamism, which gives rise to insights for pioneering a new frontier beyond current business models toward a non-contact society after the COVID-19 pandemic ends.}

The government, which has a stake in every innovation, should respond by providing a favorable business environment.

However, the relationship between government subsidies (GS) and companies' innovation efficiency is unclear. Based on a three-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and a Tobit-regression model, this study analyzes the relationship between government subsidies and innovation efficiency accounting for the influence of environmental variables on innovation performance. There were several main findings: (1) Using a three-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model, the first-stage efficiency is far from the production frontier. After removing external environmental variables and random disturbance factors, the third stage efficiency increased notably due to the increase of pure technical efficiency. Government support and regional innovation atmosphere positively influence the innovation efficiency. This paper further classifies the 119 companies into four categories based on pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency. (2) Drawing upon the Tobit-regression model, the paper reveals that government subsidies have positive influence on the innovation efficiency of metaverse listed companies. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of government subsidies in innovation efficiency and their important implications for policymakers.}

We choose sun, rain, temperature, and air quality index as the main weather variables. We use the average number of items per order and the average price of each item in each order as indicators of consumer behavior, and use store daily sales as an indicator of retail performance. We found that under rainy weather, people will buy more products with higher item prices in one order. When temperature rises, people will buy fewer products with a lower item price in one order. In addition, sunny weather and rainy weather have a positive impact on daily sales than cloudy weather. Air quality has a negative impact on daily sales, while temperature has a positive impact on sales. Finally, we study the impact of weather on different product categories. We find that the results depend on the product category characteristics.}

In our study, we address the following research questions: Does negative news have a greater impact than positive news on consumer sentiment change? Does news affect sentiment change to a greater degree when pre-news sentiment matches the news valence? Does the type of company (either B2C or B2B) matter? Our empirical findings show that consumers overreact to negative news and negative pre-news sentiment intensifies such overreaction, leading to negative herding. Further, negative pre-news sentiment is even more damaging for B2B companies than for B2C companies.}

We used the discounted cash flow (DCF) model to measure retailers’ revenue, which established that the optimal pricing and replenishing strategy could maximize the retailers’ profit. Besides, the findings were compared with the traditional profit model. Moreover, numerical experiments and sensitivity analysis were provided for decision support to retailers. Overall, this study validates that inflation significantly affects the pricing and replenishment strategy, and the DCF model is more suitable to evaluate the profits of perishable food.}

More specifically, this study identifies and examines the role of external stakeholders at each stage of the innovation process, and the resulting dynamic knowledge flows that help improve the process of urban crowdsourcing in the development of smart city solutions. Depending on the complexity of the innovation project, findings identify three primary stakeholders (citizens, public authorities, and private and public firms) and three secondary stakeholders (NGOs, universities, consulting companies). Results show at which of the four steps of urban crowdsourcing they intervene.

By drawing on insights from Diffusion of Innovation Theory and Theory of Planned Behaviour, we investigate which attributes of innovation along with managerial, organisational and environmental factors, contribute to a favourable attitude and an increased likelihood of innovation adoption. Our analysis reveals that while the perceived attributes of innovation such as its relative advantage and compatibility are major determinants of attitude formation and adoption expectation, pro-digitalisation beliefs, innovation-oriented organisational culture and environmental context factors such as high population and rates of new residential growth are critical in translation of positive attitudes to increased likelihood of adoption. Hence, in addition to perceived attributes of innovation and managerial characteristics, our findings also highlight the importance of organisational and environmental factors to the adoption expectation, and thus provide a more nuanced understanding of pre-adoption phases of innovation.}

The theories of organizational learning and dynamic capabilities are applied to identify the responses of start-ups to failure and their implications in terms of learning. Six response strategies were identified: external monitoring, internal evaluation, resource acquisition and mobilization, value creation and capture, team-level entrepreneurial, and organizational learning. These response strategies are grouped into the three dynamic capabilities dimensions: sensing, seizing, and transforming. These strategies are relevant for start-ups to overcome difficulties and continue their growth and innovation. They also offer a guideline for start-ups to develop strategies for systematic learning from failures.}

Although many companies are eager to adopt these technologies as a means to increase productivity, some concerns have been raised about the cost impact of the transformation, and its effect on the workforce. A growing body of literature is studying these phenomena but according to our review of it, there is no longitudinal perspective over 25 years illustrating the relationship between the attitude of companies to robotics and principal business indicators. This investigation uses an innovative machine learning model comprising an automated nested longitudinal clustering performed in two stages, and it is applied over a large sample of 4,578 companies from the Business Strategy Survey conducted by the Spanish Ministry of Finance and Public Administration. The findings of this research are novel in this field not only because of the longitudinal modelling applied in two stages but also because of the understanding of how companies’ characteristics and performance evolve over time depending on their degree of adoption of robotics. This knowledge is relevant for companies to understand the impact of their transformation to robotics. It also allows for the development of strategies that boost the efficiency of the companies, provides them with tools to protect them from negative financial events, and leads to an optimal sizing of their workforce.}

The mediating effects of basic knowledge coupling, complementary knowledge coupling, and extended knowledge coupling are verified through empirical tests. The results show that artificial intelligence significantly positively impacts the innovation performance of enterprises in relation to the development of green technology and its decomposition variables (efficiency and progress of green technology).

A key to the quick growth and success of relatively less popular apps is that they should make their way to the limited list of apps recommended to users of already popular apps; however, the focus of the current literature on consumers has created a void of design principles for app developers. In this study, employing a predictive network analytics approach combined with deep learning-based natural language processing and explainable artificial intelligence techniques, we shift the focus from consumers and propose a developer-oriented recommender model. We employ a set of app-specific and network-driven variables to present a novel approach for predicting potential recommendation relationships among apps, which enables app developers and marketers to characterize and target appropriate consumers. We validate the proposed model using a large (>23,000), longitudinal dataset of medical apps collected from the iOS App Store at two time points. From a total of 10,234 network links (recommendations) formed between the two data collection points, the proposed approach was able to correctly predict 8,780 links (i.e., 85.8 %). We perform Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis to identify the most important determinants of link formations and provide insights for the app developers about the factors and design principles they can incorporate into their development process to maximize the chances of success for their apps.}

We select 20 developed and 20 developing nations based on the data available from the World Bank, United Nations, and Stanford-Human-Centered AI data repositories. We initially identified 33 factors influencing AI readiness in business for both sets of countries. The XGBoost regression results imply that the AI readiness of developing countries is marginally more predictable than that of developed nations. The outcome of the XAI indicates that three influential AI readiness factors - scientific research output, internet infrastructure, and public consumption expense are common and behave similarly for both developed and developing countries. The research findings have significant practical implications for monitoring and augmenting the end-to-end AI ecosystem to leverage the true potential of digital transformation. Predictive modeling with adequate interpretation helps to identify the impact of the crucial levers of AI readiness in business.}

An exhaustive literature review is conducted to identify the main criteria affecting social, economic and environmental sustainability in the photovoltaic energy supply chain, and to explore the potential impact of Industry 4.0 on sustainability. Subsequently, three Fuzzy Inference Systems combining quantitative and qualitative data are built to calculate the supply chain's social, economic and environmental sustainability. Experts' opinions are used to identify the impact of Industry 4.0 technologies on the three pillars of sustainability for each supply chain stage. Finally, a novel sustainability index, Sustainability Index 4.0, is formulated to compute the overall sustainability of the photovoltaic energy supply chain in seven countries. The results show the applicability and usefulness of the proposed holistic model in helping policy makers, stakeholders and users to make informed decisions for the development of sustainable renewable energy supply chains, taking into account the impact of Industry 4.0 and digital technologies.}

This notable potential has attracted attention and has resulted in a growing number of studies on blockchain platforms, cloud-based platforms, and other digital technology platforms. However, DIS adoption and execution is a complex process as it depends on various success factors and barriers and affects numerous capabilities and performance outcomes. Moreover, various information systems and management theories can be utilised to underpin these relationships. Our study aims to conduct a systematic literature review that uncovers dynamic capabilities, barriers, enablers and outcomes of DIS with blockchain and cloud-based platforms, illustrates the relationship between them, and discloses methods and theories applied in supply chains. We discuss different use cases of blockchain and cloud-based platforms for DIS in various business functions in supply chains. Particularly, we reveal six DIS-powered capabilities, five performance outcomes improved by the DIS, eight main barriers, and nine enablers of DIS implementation. The lack of theoretical underpinning and causal empirical studies is identified as an important gap in the literature. This study also presents precise future research directions that can help address these gaps.}

We develop a theoretical framework with two compartments; one for observing the changes in core business model components and the other one for identifying the resisting, enabling, and driving factors affecting the transformation process. The interviews with the key informants in the business unit of the company revealed several changes that have occurred in the core business model components. The new subscription-based pricing and sales models significantly changed the way the company creates and captures value. The development and operations of the platform required new know-how and new skills, implying the importance of running the new one as a separate business model. Among other implications, our findings also highlight transformational leadership as a significant driver of business model transformation, which can be supported by establishing a business level market intelligence body undertaking the strategic management up to date in established companies.}

Despite well-intentioned efforts by policymakers, the transformation of traditional agricultural systems into smart farms remains a formidable challenge. Drawing on technology acceptance literature and Prospect Theory (PT), this article explores, compares, and prioritizes the factors that influence IoT smart farming adoption, considering both the expected gains and losses. Survey data collected from 265 farmers in Thailand was analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM) to test our hypotheses. The results demonstrate that IoT smart farming is significantly influenced by both the perceived expected gains from its adoption and the perceived expected losses from climate change in the case of not adopting IoT smart farming. However, in contrast to PT, the impact of losses is not greater than that of gains. This article offers valuable insights that are essential for shaping sustainable farming practices and informing policy frameworks in the face of mounting challenges posed by climate change.}

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) has become one of the most popular technologies in the context of customization. However, little is known about whether, how and why the use of VR affects consumers' willingness to purchase customized products. Applying the “affordances–psychological outcomes–behavioural outcomes” framework and organismic integration theory (OIT) in this study, we propose and test a model of the motivations of customer inspiration and customization intention. Our model was empirically tested through a survey of 421 customers with experience using IKEA's VR customization in three cities along the southeast coast of China. The results suggest that design affordance in VR during a customization process involves three dimensions: aesthetics, functionality, and symbolism affordance. Specifically, we find that customer inspiration mediates the relationship between design affordance in VR and customers' customization intention. Moreover, consumers' technology readiness positively moderates the relationship between design affordance in VR and customer inspiration. This study therefore highlights the important role of customer inspiration in customizing products or services and expands the research on design affordance in the context of VR.}

abstract = {An education system consists of imparting knowledge, assessing the learners, collecting feedback, analysing it, and taking proper measures to improve it. All these measures ultimately improve learner satisfaction which gets reflected in the learner performance and makes the course popular. Due to the corona pandemic, educational institutes and universities have shifted their activities online. In such a scenario, it is challenging to identify a course's popularity and the factors that make it popular. In this work, the authors have performed aspect-based sentiment analysis of learner feedback to identify the essential aspects of creating a popular course. The traditional methods for analysing feedback for sentiment analysis require manual intervention and are tedious. The authors have proposed a framework that identifies learner reviews' aspect level sentiment polarity and selected the significant aspects impacting a course's popularity. Experimental work is conducted over a large-scale real-world education dataset containing around 110 K learner comments (referred to as Educational Dataset now onwards) collected from Coursera1 and learner data from academic institution MSIT2. Different word embeddings viz., FastText, Word2Vec (Word2Vector), GloVe (Global representation of Vectors), and user-created embeddings are used for CNN (Convolution Neural Network) and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) models. These models are further compared with BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers), EvoMSA (Evolutionary Multilingual Sentiment Analysis) and ELMo (Embeddings from Language Model) classifiers to find the method that works best for identifying the aspects that impact the popularity of a course. Based on the experimental results over the collected Dataset, BERT based model provides the best results with an accuracy of 94.27%}

The present paper aims to map this growing literature to understand how SCC can contribute to the achievement of broader Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Via a systematic review of literature (SLR), the paper maps key themes at the intersection of SCC and sustainable development. Relying on nine key themes, the study presents novel insights into the domain of SCC for sustainable development. The results of the SLR reveal that collaborative innovation, collaborative process and product development are key mechanisms driving SCC. However, the extant literature has not devoted much attention to the effectiveness of SCC mechanisms or their performance. Further, the current study posits that more effective SCC strategies can boost the sustainable operational performance of the supply chain (SC) by enhancing capacity building and resource utilisation. Based on the contingency approach, this study offers a novel framework linking SCC to SDGs. The study thus has the potential to help managers and practitioners identify strategic fields of action for achieving SDGs.}

Therefore, we first introduce social bots in the realm of communication and information management by using a profound literature review. Second, by building on mediatization theory and strategic communication, we introduce the concept of deep strategic mediatization. By surveying the attitudes towards and usage of social bots of leading European communication professionals (n = 2,247) from 49 European countries, we thirdly offer first indications how diverse European organizations in different European regions use social bots. Results indicate, that leading communication professionals in Central and Western Europe as well as Scandinavia perceive highly ethical challenges, while in Southern and Eastern Europe professionals are less skeptical regarding the usage of social bots. Only 11.5 percent (n = 257) declare their organization uses or are making plans to use social bots for strategic communication. They are used primarily for identifying and following social networks users. This refers specifically to the usage of digital traces for strategic communication purposes e.g., to identify topic area opinion leaders or social media influencers. However, this represents only a small minority of the sample – leading to the conclusion that only a small minority of organizations already practice deep strategic mediatization.}

If a particular technology is in vogue and seen as a “hype,” clients are under pressure to buy the technology while, at the same time, skepticism about its claimed benefits might be reinforced. Finding a balance between optimism and skepticism is essential. In this qualitative case study, we examine how an oil and gas supplier company in Norway deals with different pressures when adopting and subsequently implementing digital twin (DT) technologies. DTs offer the promise of creating a digital representation of the physical assets that can keep production facilities operating efficiently and optimally and, as such, have been heralded as enabling the next frontier of productivity improvements. Our results reveal a set of different pressures promoting the decision to adopt the hyped technology. Yet, when descended to the local context, the hype status of DTs evokes multilevel perception segmentation that hype interpreters maneuver by building trust. Based on this analysis, we propose a framework of trust-building mechanisms that contribute to a more nuanced understanding of adoption of hyped technologies and enable practitioners to deal with hype-induced perception obstacles.}

Results indicate that fit in DHRM is a double-edged sword. While fit in the algorithmic recording is positively related to perceived insider status, fit in the automatic analysis is negatively related to competence mobilization. Furthermore, the relationship between misfit in DHRM and employees’ cognitive responses is moderated by leaders’ influence tactics in terms of leader empathy and coalition influence tactics. This study enriches research on DHRM by examining fit from a dyadic perspective.}

The SDGs set the agenda for trends in corporate social responsibility (CSR), which will gain momentum in the coming years; and businesses are the key agents of countries for the development of this agenda. The importance of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and family businesses in the economy of a country is unquestionable; however, there are very few studies on CSR that focus on MSMEs and even fewer that focus on family MSMEs. To fill this gap, this work seeks to ascertain whether the relationship between CSR and economic performance (EP) is significantly different for family and nonfamily MSMEs. To analyze the data, Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) is applied to the sample of 96 Spanish family MSMEs and 182 Spanish nonfamily MSMEs. The study presents an unprecedented finding: when making equal commitments to CSR, family MSMEs obtain a greater impact on their economic performance arising from CSR actions than nonfamily MSMEs. These findings have practical and theoretical implications for CSR in MSMEs. First, we found that when taking into account the economic, social and environmental dimensions for family and nonfamily MSMEs, CSR targets economic performance simultaneously. Second, family businesses have an additional incentive to become involved in CSR actions since these actions will be reflected to a greater extent in their economic results than those of nonfamily businesses.}

The mechanism analysis suggests that SCC affects corporate employment through factor substitution rather than job creation by promoting digital capitalization and capital and technological factor substitution. Further analyses indicate that SCC primarily reduces the number of low-skilled and non-production employees and has a stronger impact on local private, old, and industrial firms. We also find evidence of labor reallocation effects of SCC. Overall, the results highlight the trade-off between promoting SCC and mitigating employment challenges and the role of data as a new production factor in the digital economy era, providing important policy implications for stakeholders.}

In the digital transformation journey, specific digital skills and capabilities at the microfoundational level are essential to achieve success. The psychological foundations of the employees should be aligned in favor of digitalization to successfully gain competitive advantage. Not many studies are available to understand individual capabilities and skills at the microfoundational level. In this background, the aim of this study is to investigate the role of individual capability at the microfoundational level, including the leadership role along with technology capability like an AI-enabled CRM system, towards digitalization.

abstract = {The structural transformation of retail is challenging for many small cities. Rather than seeing the retailer as a sole player, this article considers retail in small cities to be shaped in a retail eco system consisting of many different actors besides retailers such as municipalities, landlords, business/city organisations, customers/citizens. The key contribution of the article is to provide new perspectives on the challenges and management of retail in small cities by applying a metaphor from the culture and fine arts sector, orchestration. The article is based on a combination of in-depth interviews and participant observation at three small cities in Sweden. In total, 38 interviews have been conducted with representatives of retailers, municipality, business/city associations and landlords. The general aspects of retail eco system as an orchestra are presented according to Klein and Kozlowski, (2000) multilevel constructs: compiled (bottom-up), composite (top-down) and emergent (culture, history). Thereafter, a number of orchestration techniques, structured around Pine and Gilmore, 1999 dimensions of experiences are presented. The article shows that the future of retailing in small cities is not merely dependent on the retailers, but on collaborations with other retailers, landlords and municipalities. An understanding of consumer culture and development of entrepreneurship culture and networks is crucial for survival and prosperity. Furthermore, rather than copying strategies developed both in and for metropolitan areas, there is a need to build on and strengthen the characteristics of the local retail eco system and the community brand identity.}

Particularly, the advancement of technologies has further given birth to a novel form of social platform as blockchain-enabled social media (i.e., SocialFi), which is growing both in size and number of users. Accordingly, the rapid development of these blockchain-enabled social media firms illustrates the requirement to better understand the reasons behind this increase and the innovative practices and strategies of firms in this emerging field. Using the case of Pixie – the world’s first fully functional decentralised photo and video sharing social network based on blockchain technology, this insight paper identifies a conceptual model of blockchain-enabled social media that is useful for illustrating the successful business strategy and operations of firms. Particularly, the identified model employs four pillars of innovation as fundamental technologies, governance and operations, incentive mechanism design, and organisational structure and performance. Based on this crypto economy social media model, the study further presents the main challenges, discusses the implications based on agency theory, as well as highlights several directions for future research associated with blockchain-enabled social media.}

abstract = {Due to recent technological advancements, social robots are becoming increasingly prevalent in the consumer space. ChatGPT, a virtual social robot, has captured significant attention from the mass media and academic practitioners alike since its release in November 2022. This attention arises from its remarkable capabilities, as well as potential challenges it poses to society and various business sectors. In light of these developments, we developed a theoretical model based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and a consumer value typology centred around consumer experiences to examine the influence of experiential factors on the intention to use ChatGPT and subsequently collaborating with it for co-creating content among business managers. To test this model, we conducted a survey of 195 business managers in the UK and employed partial PLS-structural equation modelling for analysis. Our findings indicate that the efficiency, excellence, meaningfulness of recommendations, and conversational ability of ChatGPT will influence the behavioural intention to use it during the priori acceptance stage. Based on these findings, we suggest that organisations should thoughtfully consider and strategize the deployment of ChatGPT applications to ensure their acceptance, eventual adoption, and subsequent collaboration between ChatGPT and managers for content creation or problem-solving.}

In addition, we describe the real motivations for banks to explore Blockchain, and problems they face. In order to have a good understanding of the industry, a qualitative method was adopted, and sixteen experts were interviewed. It was identified that knowledge hiding in Blockchain was common and the rationale behind was analyzed using the TPB (Theory of Planned Behavior) approach. The analysis results suggested that knowledge hiding was due to affective, behavioral and cognitive evaluations. The interviewees also provided several recommendations and success factors to overcome current issues in Blockchain adoption. Therefore, four important propositions have been developed. Finally, this article suggests how financial services should respond to this new technology and how to manage knowledge sharing in a more structured way.

However, population aging may also force companies to improve corporate governance, benefiting green innovation activities. However, existing literature on the influences of population aging on corporate green innovation activities is extremely limited. To respond to the research gaps, this study develops a theoretical framework of population aging-green innovation (PA-GI) that considers the role of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and changes in the industrial structure. After that, this study scrutinizes how population aging affects corporate green innovation activities through the case of Chinese listed companies. This study argues that population aging boosts corporate ESG performance, and such pro-environmental ESG initiatives support corporate green innovation activities. Moreover, population aging also promotes changes in the industrial structure, which can encourage corporate green innovation activities. Finally, companies in regions with high environmental regulation intensity and a high degree of digitization are most likely to experience the benefits of population aging in green innovation activities.}

Previous studies have linked firm digitalization to innovation performance; however, less attention has been given to ambidextrous innovation and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which play a vital role in economic development. Based on a knowledge-based view (KBV), this research investigates the relationship between digitalization and ambidextrous innovation in Chinese publicly listed SMEs. We found that digitalization promotes radical innovation more significantly than incremental innovation of listed SMEs. We further observed that firm digitalization and highly educated employees with a master's degree or above have a complementary effect on radical innovation, and the financial background of firms' top management team (TMT) members strengthens strengthens this complementary effect. This study not only enriches the digitalization–innovation performance relationship literature, but also contributes to the KBV by tying together three vital elements (technology, people, and relational networks) in the KBV and examining their relationships with ambidextrous innovation. It also has implications for managers of SMEs related to increasing the innovation returns from digitalization endeavors.}

This research found that technological, social, environmental, economic, regulatory and operational factors influence water utilities. New challenges are emerging around using legacy IT systems, aging infrastructure, environmental impact and sustainability, data management, data analytics and cybersecurity knowledge and skills, customer and community engagement, government reporting requirements and regulatory compliance. Water utilities are continuing to respond to influencing factors and address emerging challenges, and as a result, system interconnections are increasing, resulting in complexity and uncertainty. Methodological gaps exist in representing water utilities from a broader lens as a CPHS to identify and evaluate multiple influencing factors, their interconnections and impacts and evolving risks for supporting decision-making. Gaps also exist in strategic planning for technology adoption and data management. Future research requires a focus on identifying and mapping increasing system interconnections, modelling their emergent behaviour and understanding the implications of water utilities evolving as CPHSs.}

However, a holistic review of blockchain application in building a cyber-secure supply chain remains elusive, which can impede the advancement of the field when competing arguments are made, and pure replications are initiated. Therefore, the present study carries a systematic literature review to assess the state of literature review on the significance of blockchain in developing a cyber-secure and resilient supply chain. A systematic review of 122 peer-reviewed papers published between 2012 and 2022 has been conducted using a structured methodological approach. Further, the Theory, Context and Methodology (TCM) framework has been applied to suggest avenues for future research. Our analysis reveals six dominant themes related to blockchain and its adoption, blockchain application for resilience, blockchain application for cyber-security, blockchain and its role in intermediation, disintermediation and reintermediation, challenges of blockchain adoption and benefits of blockchain applications in the supply chain. Although the role of blockchain application in the cyber secure and resilient supply chain has been recognised, very little attention has been given to contextual factors affecting its adoption and consequences on key performance parameters. The present study contributes to the literature by synthesising the prime findings of reviewed papers and the managerial implications, thereby giving a holistic view of the existing research and presenting an array of future opportunities for firms to adopt blockchain technology in the supply chain.}

The systematic review of the available scientific literature revealed limited but rapidly growing coverage of the phenomenon by scientific studies, which have mainly focused on the role of a few digital technologies (above all, the Internet of Things), studied in isolation. The research has mainly adopted an empirical, case-based methodological approach, mostly investigating the industrial equipment, automotive, and IT industries and focusing on the role of digital technologies for the implementation of intermediate and advanced services.

Given that social ventures not only have limited resources but are also a relatively new form of entrepreneurship, they often require help of intermediary organizations, actors in social entrepreneurship that aim to deliver some level of social innovation in the context they work in and assist social entrepreneurs to build their capabilities and diffuse innovative ideas. These intermediaries also play various roles in supporting the development and growth of social business ecosystems by linking and mediating different actors to build a community of social innovators. While some of these are typical roles of accelerators or incubators in technological entrepreneurial systems, other mediating and networking roles are closer to those of intermediary organizations in the social economy. Due to the fragmented nature of the studies that investigate these issues from a particular theoretical and practical perspective, there is a lack of systematic and comprehensive analysis of the diverse roles of intermediaries in broader innovation ecosystems. To address this gap, this study adopts the innovation systems approach and examines the various “ambiguous” roles of intermediary organizations in support of social entrepreneurship. By highlighting the particular functions attributable to the nature and characteristics of social business, this study also suggests how technology can facilitate the development of sustainable social innovation systems.}

The proposed model involves three major steps. First, we use an attribute selection algorithm to identify the key factors that contribute to the profitability of a specific location. Second, we evaluate the similarity between the candidate site and the existing stores by using an improved grey comprehensive evaluation method. Finally, we use a kernel regression model to predict the sales potential of the candidate site. A case study of a well-known international restaurant chain is used to illustrate the application of the proposed data-driven model. The results indicate that our proposed model helps to accurately select the most profitable locations.}

Drawing on an extensive single case study in the regional media industry involving 59 interviews with one service provider and its customers, this study explores the digital transformation of the provider’s value proposition and how this process was collectively enacted by the provider and its customers. This study develops an empirically grounded framework illustrating the key value proposition transformation drivers, provider and customer sense-making practices, and value element reshaping implications. Overall, this study advances contemporary digital transformation and value proposition research by demonstrating how the process of digital transformation changes the nature and content of the value proposition and how managers can facilitate this process.}

The growing complexity of supply chains, characterized by over-dependencies on geographically dispersed partners across different regions, increases risks related to managing these relationships and highlights the importance of collaboration and balancing the power dynamics between SC partners. Previous studies have shown that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) can be considered the weakest link in terms of digitization and balance of power. This article aims to analyse how buyer-seller power relations moderate the relationship between the adoption of digital technologies in supply chain management (SCM) processes and innovation performance in the context of SMEs. Data were collected from manufacturing SMEs operating in Portugal. The results support the assumption that the use of digital technologies in processes related to SCM has a positive effect on SMEs innovation performance. The results also suggest that non-mediated power and reward-mediated positively moderate the relationship between the adoption of digital technologies and innovation performance, while the impact of coercive-mediated power was not confirmed. The article contributes to theory and practice by advancing the literature and guiding managers in the challenging task of carrying out digital transformation initiatives, considering their relationship with the power dynamics in the complex context of SMEs.}

First, we show how relational coordination via the adoption of disruptive technologies, like online analytics, digitalization, artificial intelligence and data-driven decision-making, promotes the quality of interactions in high-involvement work systems contexts vis-à-vis face-to-face social exchanges. Further, technologically-mediated relational coordination improves employee trust, improving individual performance and functional effectiveness outcomes.

However, the journey to harness AI for CBM is fraught with challenges as firms grapple with the lack of sophisticated processes and routines to tap into AI's potential. The fragmented literature leaves a void in understanding the barriers and development pathways for AI capabilities in CBM contexts. Bridging this gap, adopting a capabilities perspective, this review intricately brings together four pivotal capabilities: integrated intelligence capability, process automation and augmentation capability, AI infrastructure and platform capability, and ecosystem orchestration capability as drivers of AI-enabled CBM. These capabilities are vital to navigating the multi-level barriers to utilizing AI for CBM. The key contribution of the study is the synthesis of an AI-enabled CBM framework, which not only summarizes the results but also sets the stage for future explorations in this dynamic field.}

On the other hand, innovation capabilities both in terms of introducing new products and new services are of outmost importance to gain competitive advantage. Technology adoption and firm innovativeness are often interrelated, but this relation is not well understood, and in particular, the way in which digital technology adoption, product and service innovation, and competitive advantage are related to process industries has not yet been investigated. This paper develops and operationalizes a conceptual framework for product and service innovation, thereby incorporating digital technology adoption. Through an exploratory study, using quantitative data from the European Manufacturing Survey (EMS)-2015, we analyze data from 747 cases in the process industries from D, NL, A, CH, and DK. Our main findings show that companies with higher levels of digital technology implementation (breadth and depth) can introduce more radical product and service innovations. Companies with both radical innovations and service innovation make significantly greater use of their implemented technologies’ potential. Radical product innovation also yields higher returns on sales, but contrary to our assumptions, service innovation in process industries does not. We find that, in the low-tech sectors, digital technologies are used to generate product and services innovations which then translate into higher performance. In contrast, in the high-tech sectors, digital technologies have a direct impact on performance and are thus rather accustomed to realizing the efficiency gains not primarily used for innovation.}

Based on value network theory, this paper investigates whether cooperation is a critical influencer of supplier performance and examines how suppliers in CIPs can achieve and maximize value capturing under the customer value dominant condition. Large-scale data is collected from >110,000 CIPs suppliers from 2010 to August 2018 on Kaggle, one of the most well-known crowdsourcing platforms. According to econometric calculation results: 1) Suppliers' predominant capabilities and resources contribute to their workforce and financial performance improvement. 2) Excessive competition intensity has a negative impact on suppliers' performance. 3) The cooperation between suppliers is extremely important for their performance. More detailed, the accumulation of cooperation experience, the increase of partners and the heterogeneity of members in the organization have positive impact on suppliers' workforce and financial performance. The results demonstrate that for suppliers in the CIPs platform, cooperative is more optimal than competitive. The cooperation is more significant when the needs of customers are gaining more and more attention. Therefore, suppliers should explore a more flexible way of cooperation to achieve value capture. Subsequently the value balance between demanders and suppliers can be achieved.}

It is expected that this new paradigm, which employs digital tools for coordinating all value chain interactions, will significantly improve product quality, process efficiency and international competitiveness. While Industry 4.0 options raise high hopes among policymakers, it is often overlooked how ambivalently upcoming changes are viewed by industry actors themselves. This paper shows how the historical roots and context conditions of an industry shape and at times significantly hamper future prospects of technology driven progress. In our case, context refers to industry specific development trajectories, market challenges, actor constellations, and value chain characteristics, as well as local conditions prevailing in industry clusters. We explore the case of technical textile production in Germany, where Industry 4.0 elements are just starting to transform the industry's internal and external operations. Based on empirical mixed methods research in three textile clusters including a stakeholder workshop, we identify major factors that shape the implementation of novel digital production technologies and draft three narrative future scenarios. Finally, some policy recommendations are derived.}

Among the three stressors (information overload, information irrelevance, and group member value unfit) that we identified in the qualitative content analysis, information overload, information irrelevance and group member value unfit were found significantly influence fatigue, which further leads to the user's intention to leave and mute the group in the quantitative study.

Despite the growing prominence of digital servitization, we have yet to understand how such changes are being framed, reframed, and unfold in industrial firms. To this end, we undertake an in-depth longitudinal exploratory case study of an industrial firm to understand the organizational framing and reframing activities vis-à-vis digital servitization. Our findings identify how motivational, diagnostic, and prognostic framing gradually unfolds over distinct phases. Specifically, our findings reveal the occurrence of frame incongruence among different groups of actors, compelling the firm to engage in strategies and tactics to achieve frame alignment. Notably, we identify that management engages in the alignment processes of frame extension, translation, and clarification, which creates a space of workable certainty. While transient in nature, this state of workable certainty serves as a catalyst in propelling the firm forward in its pursuit of a digital servitization strategy. By shedding light on the process of digital reframing that firms undertake in order to materialize their digital servitization strategy, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of this phenomenon. Moreover, we raise pertinent managerial implications for firms embarking on the path of digital servitization, emphasizing the imperative of continuous attention to the ongoing framing and reframing processes accompanying such change endeavors.}

To this end, we created a method using techniques like topic modeling and text analysis to sort and group ideas. Then, we tested this method on data from crowdsourcing contests in Italy in 2021. In particular, considering the literature on intermediaries, we focus on intermediation in crowdsourcing to improve the decision-making processes in those initiatives where searching activities are intermediated by digital platforms, besides other human intermediaries. This method makes it easier for seekers to handle multiple ideas, and it also helps them find better-quality ideas. Moreover, from a theoretical point of view, our method could lead to better results in crowdsourcing challenges because it groups ideas based on their content without being influenced by the organizers' pre-existing knowledge or biases. This means that seekers might discover new and unexpected topics or solutions they hadn't thought of before. From a practical standpoint, for managers organizing crowdsourcing events, this method is valuable because it not only saves time and effort but also potentially uncovers innovative and diverse ideas. Additionally, the method includes a feature that shows how much participants interact and share knowledge, thus implementing the concept of “transactivity”, which, to the best of our knowledge, hasn't been used in crowdsourcing studies before. This can help crowdsourcing organizers better understand which contests are more effective at encouraging collaboration and knowledge sharing among participants.}

Specifically, this study focuses on the effects of social media analytics on four phases of competitive intelligence to improve the dynamic capabilities within manufacturing SMEs. Social media analytics are better used in certain large companies but less acknowledged in SMEs. However, limited empirical studies have used the dynamic capabilities approach and examined the causal links between social media analytics and competitive intelligence processes. A survey was conducted among 140 manufacturing SMEs in Quebec to obtain a better understanding of this relationship. Accordingly, a closed-structured questionnaire was distributed to the SMEs’ chief executive officers and managers. The data collected were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Our research findings show that social media analytics positively affect four phases of competitive intelligence, especially the phases of collection and analysis.}

It is established that organizations can enhance their performance via process and product innovation; however, the psychological foundations of TI, and the way this affects employees, are underexplored in the organization and management literature. Drawing on organismic integration theory, we aim to enrich the field of innovation and employee branding studies by examining the role of innovation capabilities in employees' motivation at work and wellbeing, which results in employee brand ambassadorship. A mixed-method approach is employed. Study 1 uses a case study to explore how employees acquire knowledge as part of their exposure to TIs. A research model that captures the underlying mechanism of how TI capabilities influence employee brand ambassadorship is then developed based on findings in Study 1. Based on Study 1 results, Study 2 conducts surveys (n = 300) to test the hypothesized framework in high-tech organizations with employees in China. Results show that both product and process innovation capabilities increase employees' psychological empowerment and autonomy, which subsequently increase their psychological wellbeing. Further, employees satisfied with their jobs are more likely to act as ambassadors for their organizational brands.

Whereas SDG 8 is premised on strengthening relational contracts between an organization and its employees, the adoption of AI has the opposite effect, detracting from the very nature of decent work.}

abstract = {Online fresh retailing enriches people's shopping choices and provides convenience to reduce the risk of infection during the pandemic. Online reviews contain consumers' attention, requirements and sentiments, and in-depth analysis of this information has guiding values for service optimization. To better understand this information, a requirement analysis idea based on the attention and sentiment distribution of online reviews was proposed, namely importance-Kano analysis. Seven different customer requirements were found, including express delivery, cost performance, communication, freshness, flavor, specification and packaging. Flavor and freshness are the most concerned attributes, and they and other attributes all influence satisfaction in their unique ways. Consumers care a lot about the shopping experience and product quality and they have a high degree of product involvement in fresh products. Service improvement should be considered as a systematic project, and the influence of competitive environment, category differences and technological development should not be ignored. A service optimization model was developed based on the concept of total quality management, which was constructed by three layers including supply chain, operation management and consumer experience. The systematic analysis is conducive to in-depth understanding of the complexity, systematical and timeliness nature of fresh product operation management.}

However, designing an appropriate program is difficult because each customer's heterogeneous purchase behavior is difficult to capture. Therefore, we simultaneously modeled purchase frequency and amount through a marked point process approach while considering program effects and customer characteristics. The results clarified that the points pressure effect was particularly strong among customers who originally visited the store infrequently and had not attained the threshold set up in the customer tier program many times in the past. In addition, we found that the three-tier customer tier program was superior to the two-tier program with respect to the operating income in supermarkets.}

abstract = {In its recent form, Artificial intelligence (AI) is an ensemble of technologies, which can be defined as machine-based systems for effective enterprise automation and influential decisions”. If businesses that use AI can potentially reap a competitive advantage, the optimal exploitation of such a complex ensemble of technologies remains uncertain as well as requires to have competitive access to complements such as data or new skills. Existing models of organizational use of technologies often ignore either the dynamics of competitive interactions (which can lead to pre-emption or epidemic diffusion) or the role of uncertainty, or both. In the case of AI, one type of uncertainty is particularly important: uncertainty about the technology's use cases (i.e., what to do with it). This paper proposes to apply a real options perspective to the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) adoption framework in order to uncover important patterns in the use of AI among firms. The results are threefold: (1) we find evidence of significant epidemic effects in AI use, (2) uncertainty moderates epidemic effects, and (3) the impact of uncertainty depends on its source: an uncertain AI use case reduces herd behaviours while uncertainty about use case returns still favours them. These results highlight the importance of exploration and collective learning in the diffusion of emerging and complex technologies, especially when companies struggle to identify the most profitable use cases for the technology.}

The results show that digital transformation can significantly increase total factor productivity but decrease firm performance by increasing the operational cost rate, reducing total asset turnover, and increasing management expenses. Managerial myopia can significantly amplify the negative effects of digital transformation. Low- or high-digital transformation is not conducive to firm performance, whereas median-digital transformation can significantly improve firm performance. The more labor-intensive enterprises, the more negative the effect of digital transformation on firm performance. This study enriches and supplements the resource-based view and upper echelons theory and extends the research on the economic consequences of digital transformation based on the context of developing countries.}

How are NATs playing a role in providing an innovative offering for the social good? Where does it take place in society? How can SI be deployed in society to reach out to the populace? and, Why SI is required for society? By employing the triangulation approach, we provide a comprehensive framework recognizing the different contexts under which SI takes place in society, explaining the possible outcomes and suggesting the boundary conditions. We then provide the generalized propositions on the proposed relationship in the SI framework.

The manifestation of servitization varies across industry sectors, as it began from the manufacturing industry with rapid expansion into the digital economy enabled by the advancement of digital technology. Servitization innovation denotes the innovative approaches by which servitization is organized from the organizational governance perspective. Despite the steady increase in scholarly attention and accumulated body of knowledge on servitization, it remains unclear what are the archetypes of servitization innovation and what are the differences between the actors, mechanisms and instruments for servitization innovation. This paper aims to synthesize the received wisdom and contemporary understandings on servitization innovation by undertaking a systematic literature review of the field. From the technology-oriented perspective, we articulate the characteristics of servitization innovation within a pure manufacturing context and a digital context by proposing a typology of servitization innovation, namely organic, relational, and system. We conclude this review by presenting future research directions to further develop servitization innovation, especially within the context of technological innovation.}

A conceptual model drawing on social presence theory was developed to interpret the paths through which the anthropomorphic features of AI chatbots influence users' intentions to reuse OHC services. A total of 502 valid responses were collected through an experimental survey and analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results suggest that all the proposed anthropomorphic features of AI chatbots can enhance users perceived social presence and facilitate their communication quality with and trust in AI chatbots directly and/or indirectly, eventually leading to a high intention to reuse OHC services. In addition, the influence of perceived social presence on trust and communication quality was more significant for those experiencing relatively mild symptoms of the disease than for those experiencing intense symptoms. This study contributes by proposing a framework from the perspective of anthropomorphism and social presence to understand users' behavioral intentions in the OHC context. The findings of the empirical analysis have key implications for the improvement of OHC services.}

Drawing on dynamic capability theory and exploratory qualitative interviews with senior ‘elite’ executives from five of the world's largest multinational firms, the study outlines a new conceptual framework for digital transformative capability development. The integrative framework demonstrates how the three core capabilities of digital sensing, digital seizing, and digital reconfiguring manifest through associated capabilities of Strategic Sensing, Rapid Prototyping, Organization Structure, Business Model Transformation, and Cultural/Mindset Transformation. Internal and external contingencies are proposed as moderators of the relationship between IIoT and emerging technologies, and digital transformative capability development.

abstract = {Personalization drives value co-creation and willingness to pay for customers. Consumers are keen to receive personalized services but have various willingness to pay for the personalization process. The willingness to pay is influenced by motives for customer purchase behavior and personalization expectations in a specific context. It also depends on disposable income and the availability of resources, as well as the severity of requirements. The results indicate that customers comprise a heterogeneous market concerning their personalization expectations and willingness to pay. The paper proposes a customer typology based on a conceptual framework that includes personalization, willingness to pay, customer philosophy, and novelty-familiarity continuum. By analyzing data from thirty-eight semi-structured interviews, six customer types are proposed, namely: Budget Adventurer, Family Explorer, Relation Seeker, Relaxation Seeker, Delight Seeker, and Must-Have Customer. The findings suggest that revenue managers should understand customer personalization preferences for each type in order to develop effective pricing strategies.}

However, with the advent of digital technologies, a new kind of product innovations gained importance: digital product and service innovations (DPI). As a consequence of their idiosyncratic characteristics, the usefulness and validity of existing product innovation management concepts cannot be transferred to the context of DPI without further ado. Accordingly, this study reinvestigates the role of IT-C in the specific context of DPI. Therefore, we begin with a differentiation of DPI from traditional, non-digital product innovation. Then, we propose that IT-C affect the performance of DPI projects via two paths. First, based on the notion that DPI rely on the use of innovative IT, we assume that IT-C directly impact DPI performance. Second, following prior research that has argued that the performance contribution of IT-C is mediated by other organizational intermediaries, we assume that IT-C also indirectly contribute to DPI performance through their positive influence on other organizational capabilities. One such organizational capability that mediates the influence of IT-C on DPI performance is a firm’s DPI capabilities (DPI-C). DPI-C allow firms to deploy their digital resources for DPI purposes and, thus, are an important antecedent for DPI performance. To test our assumptions, we use partial least squares–structural equation modeling technique and analyze survey data collected from DPI projects across different industries in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.}

Based on LDA model, the paper investigates the factors on value co-creation in the carpooling services and how multi-stakeholders participate in this process. Through a thematic analysis of 5502 valid answers from a Chinese Q&A online community, we indicate that the carpooling services comprise multi-stakeholders such as users, platforms, governments, and the public, each playing distinct roles in the process of value co-creation. While the traditional perspective highlights the dyadic interaction between users and platforms as the primary driver of value co-creation, the roles of governments and the public are increasingly significant. Our findings are conducive to enriching the theory of value co-creation in shared mobility, and provide practical insights for its future sustainable development.}

The findings indicate that peers' participation choices in DIF have a positive impact on the individual's participation choices in DIF, primarily through an information transmission mechanism. Moreover, the regional economy effects are explicitly demonstrated since the progress of DIF in more advanced communities may produce a unidirectional spillover effect on less advanced communities. Based on these results, policy implications are recommended to enhance financial education and construct financial wellness programs.}

Based on provincial panel data from 2011 to 2021, this paper uses fixed effect model and spatial Durbin model to test the impact and spatial effect of high-tech industrial agglomeration (HIA) and regional green development (RGD). Research has found that: (1) China's overall RGD level is relatively high, presenting a spatial pattern of “central region>eastern region>western region”. (2) HIA and RGD have a significant spatial correlation, exhibiting a “high high” or “low low” spatial clustering feature. HIA has a promoting effect on RGD in both the province and surrounding provinces, with a significant positive spatial spillover effect. (3) HIA significantly improved the RGD levels in the eastern and central regions, but played a hindering role in the western regions. (4) The impact of HIA on RGD varies in different stages of development. The two stages of HIA have significantly promoted the improvement of RGD levels in both the province and surrounding provinces, and the “2016–2021” stage has a stronger promoting effect than the “2011–2015” stage. Finally, based on the research, this article proposes some relevant policy recommendations.}

Patent landscaping is a crucial task required during the early stages of an R & D project to avoid the risk of patent infringement and to follow current trends in technology. The first task of patent landscaping is to extract the target patent for analysis from a patent database. Because patent classification for patent landscaping requires advanced human resources and can be tedious, the demand for automated patent classification has gradually increased. However, a shortage of well-defined benchmark datasets and comparable models makes it difficult to find related research studies. This paper proposes an automated patent classification model for patent landscaping based on transformer and graph embedding, both of which are drawn from deep learning. The proposed model uses a transformer architecture to derive text embedding from patent abstracts and uses a graph neural network to derive graph embedding from classification code co-occurrence information and concatenates them. Furthermore, we introduce four benchmark datasets to compare related research studies on patent landscaping. The obtained results showed prominent performance that was actually applicable to our dataset and comparable to the model using BERT, which has recently shown the best performance.}

Based on the upper echelons theory and strategic orientation theory, we propose that the diversity and average education level of TMT positively impact firms' digital orientation. The average age and tenure of TMT have a negative impact on the digital orientation of firms. The overseas and financial backgrounds of TMT members have a positive impact on the digital orientation of firms. Our hypothesis was tested using large-scale longitudinal data and computer-aided text analysis methods from Chinese listed companies.

One of the key management processes that affect sustainability is the SC operations planning since its fundamental role in achieving a balance between supply and demand in a sustainable manner. Moreover, in an uncertain and dynamic environment such as the textile sector, it is necessary to provide a certain learning capability to the operations planning techniques used to increase the speed and quality of response of the textile SC to unexpected situations. In this context, mathematical programming models, heuristics and artificial intelligence techniques have proven their validity to achieve sustainable, robust and smart supply chains. Despite their potential, neither a conceptual framework (CF) nor a literature review have been detected to support the development and study of such models in the textile supply chain operations planning. In view of these gaps, this paper proposes a CF for supporting the sustainable and smart operations planning of the textile supply chains in a dynamic and uncertain context based on a set of dimensions, categories and elements that reflect the specific characteristics of the textile sector. Firstly, a tentative CF is predefined based on other generic works on SC operations planning in uncertain context and the own authors’ knowledge. Secondly, a structured literature review based on this CF has been made resulting, at the same time, in the updating of some of its dimensions, categories and elements to reflect some textile specific characteristics. Consequently, the CF is not only predefined but also logically derived from the literature analysis. The results of the literature review show that there is a great opportunity to contribute to making textile supply chains more sustainable, smart, flexible, robust and resilient in dynamic and uncertain environments.}

An integrative framework, based on the service-dominant logic and nudge theory, conceptualizes smart nudging as uses of cognitive technologies to affect people’s behaviour predictably, without limiting their options or altering their economic incentives. Several choice architectures and nudges affect value co-creation, by (1) widening resource accessibility, (2) extending engagement, or (3) augmenting human actors’ agency. Although cognitive technologies are unlikely to engender smart outcomes alone, they enable designs of conditions and contexts that promote smart behaviours, by amplifying capacities for self-understanding, control, and action. This study offers a conceptualization of actors’ value co-creation prompted by AI-driven nudged choices, in terms of re-institutionalizing processes that affect agency and practices.}

This study draws upon the theory of competitive advantage to investigate the influence of Internet convergence at different stages on manufacturing enterprises' competitive advantage. Using unique hand-collected patent data from Chinese manufacturing listed firms between 2005 and 2018, we found that technology convergence and market convergence enhance manufacturing enterprises' competitive advantage, while business convergence weakens the competitive advantage. In addition, the mechanism tests indicated that technology convergence, business convergence, and market convergence all contribute to the formation of product differentiation advantages that are difficult to imitate and enhance manufacturing enterprises' competitive advantages through product differentiation. Conversely, business convergence and market convergence harm cost control, and thus, reduce enterprises’ competitive advantage. The findings imply that emerging markets need to enhance their Internet convergence strategy.}

Furthermore, the spatial Durbin model indicates that intelligentization has both horizontal and vertical technology spillover effects on technological innovation. Specifically, the intelligentization of horizontal- and forward-linked industries has positive impacts on technological innovation in the focal industry. Additionally, technological innovation exhibits significant spatiotemporal dependence, as manifested by the negative spillover effects of prior technological achievements in other industries on current technological innovation in the focal industry.}

In addition to reviewing the literature as a whole, our study investigated the time-dependent co-evolution of research sub-streams. We examined the relative influence of publications and canonical papers (algorithmic historiography) within and between three separate time spans (bibliographic coupling). We found that business model foundations draw from three major business sub-disciplines—strategy, entrepreneurship, and innovation—whilst new frontiers (e.g., Industry 4.0, sustainability, and networks) offer an opportunity to increase the inter-connectedness of business model research. Finally, we discuss contemporary topics and future avenues for business model research.}

Based on the results of an original survey carried out in 2019, we investigate these links for a sample of 711 manufacturing MSEs located in Johannesburg. We estimate the relationships sequentially, firstly estimating the relationship between digitalization and innovation, and secondly the relationship between innovation and productivity. Our results show that selected digital communication technologies including the use of social media and of a business mobile phone for surfing the internet have a positive effect on innovation, and that innovation conditional on the use of these technologies has a positive effect on labor productivity. The findings suggest that public programs aimed at fostering inclusive digitalization must consider the types of digital technologies that are most accessible and beneficial to small firms, including those operating informally.}

Although IS may offer gains, extant research lacks empirical evidence on their effectiveness in customer value creation when used independently – discrete structures – and in combination with OS and distributors – hybrid structures. This study aims to assess the value creation performance of IS in discrete and hybrid structures. Results from regression estimations of 13,210 B2B customers over two years in a single-firm research design unveil how IS increase value creation when used independently; yet, using IS together with OS or distributors in hybrid structures, decreases performance. IS are more effective in historically less valuable customers and less complex sales processes. This study advances knowledge on multichannel IS structures’ effectiveness in value creation, helping sales managers allocating resources across channels.}

Adopting an experimental between-subjects design across three studies, this research showed that VR does not necessarily outperform static pictures in facilitating mental imagery when consumers have high (vs. low) product knowledge. However, the negative impact of product knowledge is reduced when consumers engage in shopping for experiential rather than task-focused orientations. Moreover, high (vs. low) -involvement products also play a role in reducing the negative effect of product knowledge on VR effectiveness. This research address the gaps in the literature by demonstrating the efficacy of VR retailing in the context of product knowledge, shopping orientation, and product involvement. For marketers, this research shows that VR should be used with discretion, considering the product types, consumer shopping orientations, and product involvement.}

We conducted a chronological network analysis considering the growth of these four dimensions and the connections between them. We also analyzed keywords and the main journals publishing on these four smart dimensions. We show that the literature has mainly been devoted to the study of Smart Manufacturing, although attention to the other smart dimensions has been growing in recent years. Smart Working is the less explored dimension, with many opportunities for future research. We show that research opportunities are concentrated in the interfaces between the different smart dimensions.

These core drivers are as follows: 1) scanning the environment and recognizing opportunities, 2) iteratively adjusting the business model with an asset-light structure, 3) achieving operational excellence through digitization, 4) building an efficient and entrepreneurial workforce combined with leadership and vision, 5) leveraging internal resources to strengthen positioning and expand the market, 6) attracting capital to facilitate growth realization, and 7) cultivating organizational agility and a transformation culture. While core drivers one to five imply a processual nature, the sixth and seventh core drivers serve as a foundation for MRBS. Moreover, this study outlines several areas of tension within the process of MRBS. Therefore, the study provides valuable insights for scholars and practitioners.}

We find ESOPs significantly reduce corporate financial fraud. This is because of stock ownership of non-executives rather than executives. The underlying mechanisms are heightened internal monitoring and external monitoring through which ESOPs curb executives’ opportunistic behaviour. Our results are robust to parallel trend test, placebo test, PSM approach, instrument variable test, and considering omitted variable concern, partial observability problem, model specification, stock market crash, and industry effect. Our additional analyses indicate that the effect of ESOPs on corporate financial fraud is more pronounced when firms with weaker corporate governance, poorer information environment, less powerful executives and higher-intensity and broader-based plans. Collectively, our results indicate that ESOPs play a role, as an alternative corporate governance mechanism, in mitigating financial fraud.}

The objective of this research is to investigate how corporate foresight and competitive intelligence, considered as parts of an anticipatory system, create knowledge. Our main contribution lies in arriving at a better understanding of these processes in the mainstream of knowledge creation grounded in the SECI model. To this end, we followed a longitudinal case-study methodology for more than eight months within a leading bank in Morocco. The findings show that while the competitive intelligence unit focuses more on commercial and competitor intelligence targeting hence other banks market strategies, the corporate foresight unit tries to identify the bank market weak signals and major trends in the banking sector. Knowledge creation is mainly triggered in the social interaction context in the competitive intelligence unit, while the externalization phase involving interacting Bas is critical to knowledge creation in the corporate foresight unit. The results also confirm the presence of a black hole strategy problem and a lack of coordination between competitive intelligence and corporate foresight processes, thus highlighting the need for dynamic integrated anticipatory systems.}

The regression results show a positive and significant relationship between robots and firm innovation.

The latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling technique is applied to extract latent topics from the negative posts. Then, a new opportunity evaluation framework for handling consumers' complaints is developed to discover important and emerging product topics. Topic engagement analysis based on user engagement indicators is used to measure how well the user attention to each negative topic, while topic emergence analysis based on the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) is to measure the topic emergence level. Further, this research formulates a new product strategy map that prioritizes negative topics for developing product improvement strategies. Finally, KeyGraph based on the chance discovery theory is applied to further explore product opportunities based on less frequent but important terms in the collected textual data for enhancing consumer experience. A smart home application is used as a case study. Ten topics are extracted and several critical topics are identified, such as “after-sales services”, “home security systems“, and ”media streaming devices“. In addition, through KeyGraph analysis, several product strategies are recommended, including offering quality after-sales services, increasing product and service reliability, and providing seamless integration of various home devices. The developed methodology can help firms discover critical product topics and provide insightful information for developing product improvement strategies.}

In contrast, SF is conducted to estimate sales revenues of the firms. In the past, DP usually focused on optimizing resource allocation while SF is roughly based on historical data. In reality, DP and for the upstream motherboard and SF for the firm closely rely on the estimation of sales volumes of the downstream computer products. Meanwhile, the dynamic interactions between the main competitors significantly influences the performance of SF. To highlight the impacts of demand uncertainties and dynamic interactions, this research presents a novel framework to overcome difficulties: (1) demand uncertainties arising from seasonal variations and cyclic trends in computer products are captured, (2) DP and SF consider the change of product volatility, (3) the dynamic interactions between the MB and computer products are considered to elicit managerial insights. Experimental results show that the presented framework successfully achieves the above-mentioned goals and has potential to be generalized to other industrial components.}

Drawing on the dynamic capability view, this study aims at exploring the relationship among supply chain dynamic capabilities (SCDCs), supply chain integration (SCI), supply chain resilience (SCR), sustainable competitive advantage (SCA), and sustainable supply chain performance (SSCP). The study collected 325 usable responses from healthcare supply chain organizations in the developing country of Pakistan, including hospitals, pharmaceutical manufacturing firms, surgical and equipment manufacturing firms, etc. Structural equation modeling using Smart-PLS v.3.3.2 was adopted for the data analysis. The results indicate that SCDCs positively influence SCI, SCR, SCA, and SSCP. This study finds that SCA, SCI, and SCR mediate the relationship between SCDCs and SSCP. This study contributes by aligning the SC dynamic capabilities for supply chain visibilities (i.e., sensing, learning, and coordinating) in the healthcare context. It has examined the impacts of SCDC, SCI, and SCR collectively rather than addressing them piecemeal. Sensing, learning, and coordinating capabilities through frequent collaborative meetings offer healthcare firms SC integration, allowing them to respond to the changing environment quickly and resiliently, further improving their SCA and SSCP. Since disruptions are inevitable, healthcare organizations must turn uncertainties into opportunities and activate a dynamic and resilient strategy to absorb stress. SCA and SSCP improve when SCDCs/SCR and disruptions are properly balanced.}

After a careful review of the most recent economic papers, we offer an alternative theory on the cost of privacy and data protection regulations. We have observed that the characteristics of the regulation lead not only to the amplification of costs that have been traditionally assigned as variable costs by the literature, but also of costs that used to be fixed but have been outsourced in the digital economy, meaning that significant new variable costs might trigger diseconomies of scale. At the same time, privacy and data protection regulations have created incentives that are making the dominant firms insource, in what seems to be a way back to increased sunk fixed costs for these firms. Having all that in mind, we claim that the perception of deterrence and compliance costs has affected how firms might decide to incur higher risks to avoid costs. Although compliance costs are high, we claim that an efficient implementation of the regulation avoids much of these costs. Our claim is supported by evidence that a relevant share of the regulatory costs are now variable costs, leaving room for at least two efficient strategies that medium-sized firms might implement in order to avoid them. First, firms can lower the volumes of data that they use without significantly impairing the predictive functions of their algorithms. Second, firms can invest in security at a comparatively lower degree than dominant firms considering their lower exposure to strong regulatory action.}

abstract = {Businesses harness the power of natural language processing (NLP) to automate processes and make data-driven decisions. However, NLP raises concerns on a number of fronts due to its potential for disruption, which can be addressed with the assignment of responsibility. Therefore, responsible NLP (RNLP) can be designed as a principlist framework to ensure NLP systems are used in an ethical manner. The study proposes a principlist framework with the formulation of eight principlist ethical principles to ensure NLP is safe, secure and reliable for responsible decision making and subsequently results in social benefits. Using snowball sampling, data are collected from 15 informants, who represent senior-level positions in diversified industries. The analysis is performed with qualitative research methodology. The result produces two ethical practices. First is the adoption of RNLP as a disruptive technology for ethical decision making for social benefits and second is the creation of a culture of responsibility.}

This paper presents the application of Emotional Text Mining (ETM) in the field of brand management. ETM is an unsupervised procedure aiming to profile social media users. It is based on a bottom-up approach to classify unstructured data for the identification of social media users’ representations and sentiments about a topic. It is a fast and simple procedure to extract meaningful information from a large collection of texts. As customer profiling is relevant for brand management, we illustrate a business application of ETM on Twitter messages concerning a well-known sportswear brand in order to show the potential of this procedure, highlighting the characteristics of Twitter user communities in terms of product preferences, representations, and sentiments.}

We aim to define collaborative configurations of ecosystem actors in digital servitization based on their value creation and capture and their social base of collaboration. We propose four configurations of inter-firm collaboration, based on the level of joint value creation activities and value capture interdependence among the actors: expanded business, enhanced business, platform business and symbiotic business. We analyze how these different collaboration types operate based on a multi-case study approach using the Social Exchange Theory (SET) to examine actors' interactions. We focus on four elements of SET: trust, commitment, reciprocity, and power. We found that trust, commitment and reciprocity are related to value creation and capture dynamics, while power is mostly affected by other external factors. These four elements allow to define the operationalization of the four types of inter-firm collaboration in digital servitization ecosystem. We contribute to the theory showing how service and digital suppliers interact with the servitized product firm in the ecosystem. Managers can learn the elements involved in different business models and collaboration arrangements for the provision of servitized digital solutions aiming to better decide the servitization strategy they want to follow.}

The study of UX helps to integrate customers' potential needs into the product's design. Because customer reviews in e-commerce are not structured and categorized, it is necessary to analyze UX based on customer opinions systematically. This study tries to structure UX in a product's positive/negative context through a neural network-based self-organizing map (SOM). As a result of analyzing 10,482 reviews on wireless earbuds in BestBuy, an electronic product e-commerce platform, it was confirmed that it is a suitable method for categorizing user experiences between reviews and deriving important factors. In particular, the difference in core UX elements by positive/negative context of the product was verified based on the star rating. The results of this study are expected to contribute to product improvement and business improvement that reflect customer needs by companies or designers who design products for end-users.}

Using Crist-Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (csQCA), the study took a holistic approach to the emerging topic of humanoid robots, and proposed a QCA-based conceptual framework. The results revealed that consumers will always demonstrate a strong intention to visit a robot-operated store when the configurations of HRT and retail assistance performance or HRT and social intelligence are present (sufficient conditions). Most importantly, consumers will never demonstrate a strong intention to visit the store in the absence of HRT (necessary condition). This study serves as an example of new alternative analytical methods, such as large-N csQCA applications, to traditional multivariate analyses.}

This research seeks to understand whether and how consumers perceive and process such a rhetorical figure. An exploratory qualitative approach is taken in two studies by using semi-structured interviews to explore consumers' reactions to different types of ads with food visual metaphors. The results reveal the predominance of congruency as a key processing mechanism of the ad at three levels: (a) between the food pictorial metaphor and the brand product category, (b) between the food visual metaphor and the brand itself, and (c) between the visual metaphor and the headline. Moreover, the food appetizing dimension, ad creativity, aesthetic appreciation of the ad, and consumers' aesthetic sensitivity are all revealed to play major roles in attitudes toward the ad.}

We choose the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework as the benchmark model and quantify the importance of supply chain factors by comparing the prediction accuracy of the benchmark model using only the TOE framework with an extended model combining supply chain factors with the TOE framework. Based on data collected from 629 Chinese firms, we find that Support Vector Machine stands out among all machine learning algorithms: the complete model including both supply chain and TOE factors reaches an accuracy rate of 89.3 %, while the model including only TOE factors has an accuracy rate of 83 %. Based on a 10-fold cross-validated paired t-test, we further confirm that incorporating supply chain factors can significantly improve the prediction accuracy by 6.34 % over the benchmark model. Our results indicate that TOE factors are insufficient to understand and predict BT adoption; supply chain factors also need to be considered.}

A longitudinal field study reveals that capability development demands induce changes to institutional foundations; then, as institutions change, further capabilities can be developed, all of which may instigate wider market innovation outcomes. This study conceptualizes this intricate, iterative process, as well as its evolutionary market innovation outcomes. The proposed three-level capability model can guide firms striving to offer new and innovative services.

Furthermore, the study measures the degree of improvement in the lives of the elderly more intuitively using the consumption upgrade metric and examines the impact of the digital economy on the lives of the elderly. The findings indicate that digital economic development has made a remarkable contribution to the scaling up the elderly population's economic structure and material affluence. The results of propensity score matching and the instrumental variables approach remain robust. The digital dividend for senior individuals is mainly delivered through more convenient payment, lower search costs, and more social interaction. Moreover, elderly individuals living in bigger cities with high human and physical capital or digital and media literacy enjoy more digital dividends. Therefore, while supporting the digital economy's development, the government should prioritize and spend resources on elderly individuals who enjoy fewer digital dividends to realize the equality of digital rewards. The study's findings can provide a new perspective on the overall balanced development of the digital economy and help stimulate the development of the elderly market by releasing digital dividends.}

The solution proposed considers both the investment for missing components and the transportation costs between hubs and takes into account constraints on the overall number of items produced, the budget for new component orders and the minimum lot scheduling thresholds. Moreover, to avoid the increment of obsolescences due to raw material orders, the MILP model bounds purchased components to a percentage of used ones. A real worldwide dataset provided by a fashion company, market leader in the design, manufacture and distribution of fashion, luxury, sports and performance eyewear, was used to test performances and repeatability of the mathematical model under different configurations. The results obtained show a huge positive impact on the financial results.}

This matrix assists in identifying how various AI applications may augment or automate human intelligence, thereby helping to resolve prevailing OI challenges. It provides guidance on how organizations can use AI to establish, execute and govern exchanges across the OI stages. Finally, we lay out an agenda for future research.}

In this qualitative case study, two Finnish smart cities were examined by employing an ecosystem value balance framework to identify how the value proposition is created and what types of value can be captured during the early phases of the ecosystem. The results show that at the very beginning of the life cycle, monetary, epistemic, and social investments are required. The earliest values captured are epistemic, social, and functional. Prominent financial value is seen as a potential value, but to achieve it, the ecosystem should have a common purpose, successful external communication, low entry barriers, seamless internal information sharing, and plenty of co-operation between the ecosystem actors.}

Set in France, this study identifies how food-trucks harnessed technology to support sustainable social business. We use triangulation to collect and analyse data from consumers and food-truck owners/managers on their perceptions of the value proposition and its limitations. Framed by the lockdown, we unpack the challenges faced by society and investigate ways in which food-trucks provide a sustainable alternative for eating out. We contribute to theory on social business and social innovation by acknowledging the socio-technical synergy existing in the specific context of food-trucks. The study acknowledges social equation as a key success element and validates the principles of social business in a new context.}

Amongst other advances, Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies are having a growing impact on society; they have become a significant part of family business resources to create more sustainable environments and exploit new opportunities. However, few studies have analysed the impacts of I4.0 on responsible environmental management and society in the context of a family business. To take a step toward filling this gap, this study has employed a system dynamics model to evaluate the impacts of I4.0 on the clean production processes of family businesses in an emerging economy and to describe I4.0 practices on determinants of ethical behaviour and environmental management. Implementation is conducted in the packaging sector to analyse the impacts of I4.0 on CO2 emissions, total packaging waste recovery and societal responsibilities on family businesses in Turkey. The results show that ethical business development contributes toward enhancing corporate social responsibility and environmental management systems in an I4.0 context. The findings can inform the efforts of managers, governments and decision-makers to analyse and manage the societal and environmental impacts of their activities to create a more sustainable environment for family businesses.}

In response, enterprises increase their investments in process innovation (PI) to balance revenue generation and cost reduction while simultaneously accumulating knowledge. Exploring the relation between LCE and PI is crucial to guide enterprises in effectively balancing these inputs, as well as to examine the role of government regulations on carbon emissions in motivating enterprises to enhance their efforts. This study proposes a dynamic optimal control model integrating PI and LCE within the dual-carbon policy framework, considering the effect of knowledge accumulation (KA). Moreover, it evaluates changes in inputs and benefits under profit-optimal and social welfare-optimal conditions. Finally, a comparative analysis is conducted using numerical simulation and emulation. The findings indicate complementary and substitution effects between the two inputs: the KA effect enhances input stability, and the impact of social incentives consistently outweighs that of monopoly incentives. Furthermore, CT and CS policies exhibit cross-impacts on enterprise returns and the two inputs.}

This study focuses on public attention, which is seldom discussed as an influencing factor of wastewater treatment, although it has increased in recent years due to the rapid development of Internet technology. Herein we verify that not only public attention related to wastewater but also wastewater treatment performance among provinces has stable spatial correlations. A Spatial Durbin model is used to investigate the impact of public attention on wastewater treatment. The results show that, for the local province, public attention will help improve wastewater treatment by promoting government to enact laws and regulations. At the same time, public attention in the local province will improve the wastewater treatment of its surrounding provinces, even if there are no regulations or public attention there. Therefore, the public could be a very effective supervisor of environmental issues. In view of these results, policy recommendations are proposed, which can be applied to improve China's wastewater treatment. In the future research, exploring the different impacts of the public's positive and negative attitudes will be conductive to evaluate environmental management in great detail.}

Review analysis follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. In order to help better screen, diagnose and monitor such disorders, ML identifies early onset of substance intake as predictors of disorders. The study measures identified in the articles (N=26) illustrate the exclusive use of ML to bring out insights of substance use disorders. Brain-related factors, behavioural phenotypes, and functional differentiation of the brain can express a great deal about disorders. Findings also identify the insights into various research levels, classification techniques, performance measures, challenges, and future directions related to use of ML. Random forests models are largely used for better performance. In addition, the diversity of interviews, questionnaires, brain imaging and the latest digital tools is part of this review. A longitudinal study with clinical validation could open up new models to explore substance use disorders.}

Based on a survey of 551 US respondents, we identify four necessary traits and five combinations of traits that predict adoption. We contribute to consumer psychology theory by advancing the understanding of the motivational mechanisms of consumers’ adoption of autonomous vehicles that are triggered and operationalised by personality traits and conceptualising innovativeness as a complex multidimensional construct. From a managerial perspective, our findings highlight the significance of incorporating elements that are congruent with target customers’ personality traits, when designing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative products.}

Secondly, in 2015, robotics accounted for a 5% increase of SME productivity level (2% in 2008). Thirdly, between 2008 and 2015, SME labor productivity models have progressively granted greater relevance to multi-factor productivity components (knowledge flows and the use of robotics) and human capital. Finally, robot use has generated new complementarity relationships among the explanatory factors of labour productivity. In already-robotized SMEs, the knowledge spillover relates with more favorable effects of capital deepening and exports and to human capital in the non-robotized SMEs.}

The emotional content of customers' self-reported communication on social robots deployed across international hotels is categorized through Plutchik's wheel of emotions by using advanced text analytics techniques to track and analyze its evolution over time. Findings show that consumers generally express positive emotions towards social robots. Trust, anticipation and joy are the most frequently expressed emotions. Empirical results from multivariate regression analysis indicate that joy has the greatest magnitude and that anticipation and surprise do not significantly influence consumers' opinions and comments. Negative emotions are less frequent but have a significantly negative impact, which might be considered by hotel managers willing to introduce social robots.}

Everyone experiences it in various situations, including buying food. Nonetheless, although buying something to share with others is quite common in our daily lives, most consumer research on buying focuses on the condition of “self-use” rather than “sharing.” The main purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of promotional offers on consumers' purchase decisions when buying food for self-use/sharing with others. The authors conducted four experiments to answer the main research questions. The results indicated that consumers prefer “price discounts” over “bonus packs” when the shopping task relates to self-use due to their concern about “loss reduction.” In contrast, they prefer bonus packs over price discounts when the shopping task relates to sharing with others because of their focus on “extra gains.” In addition, consumers’ perceived responsibility is a moderator. When perceived responsibility is low and the purchase is for self-use (sharing with others), price discounts (bonus pack) are favored over bonus packs (price discounts). However, when perceived responsibility is high, consumer preference to promotional offers are not significant different either in self-use or sharing with others condition. It seems that role of responsibility is influential when the shopping task relates to self-use. This study not only contributes to a deeper understanding of consumer psychology but will also be beneficial to practitioners in designing effective promotional strategies that consider motives for food shopping.}

Financial theory has traditionally emphasised the economic importance of access to external resources for fostering a start-up ecosystem; however, little attention has been paid to finding fair value for technology ventures. This is a challenging issue, as their growth is rather non-linear and has a capital structure complex because of various fundraising rounds with different classes of shares, which differ in terms of their rights, and thus, the degree of investor protection. We address this problem by proposing a novel start-up valuation model based on liquidation preferences. The main idea behind this model is that the issue of any preferred equity within a follow-up financing round is used as an opportunity to value common shares, and thus, the value of the wealth of its shareholders. After implementing the model on specific contract terms in a case study, our approach provides decision makers with significantly more accurate results than those achieved by post-money valuation, which is a widespread practice in the venture capital industry. Our model contributes to the redefinition of established valuation models, provides guidance to founders, investors, and managers, and supports better decision-making regarding the allocation of scarce resources in technology-oriented industries.}

Using machine learning models in this field might be beneficial but requires some unique considerations in how organizations govern, assure, audit, and support the use of AI. While substantial work has been done on AI ethics, organizational implantation studies are rare and often anecdotal, particularly in HR. In this article, we would like to better understand the common ethical considerations and organizational responses for developing AI for HR use and how different organizations engage with them by comparing two case studies. This paper begins by reviewing AI ethical issues specific to HR and describes the common mitigation strategies proposed in the literature. After this introduction, case studies are illustrated, and the organizational responses in both cases are analyzed. The discussion section shows that although the organizations were aware of the AI ethics issues, their responses varied and depended on different governance and self-regulation mechanisms that might have impinged their ability to proactively engage with ethical issues. A second finding is that the organization used only a relatively small set of mitigation strategies proposed in the literature, and we propose several reasons for this. These insights might be important to various organizations deploying or developing AI for HR use that want better governance, assurance, and audit mechanisms to responsibly address the ethical issues raised by AI in this field.}

In this article, we introduce the Quantum City metaphor—grounded in fundamental notions of quantum mechanics—as a new conceptual lens for investigating urban complexity. We then build upon the metaphor, theorizing a set of assumptions grounded in three fundamental concepts of quantum theory: relativity, uncertainty, and duality/parallelism. Finally, we propose an empirical conceptualization of Quantum Cities based on the concrete adoption of quantum technologies to deal with urban complexity. This is achieved through a systematic literature review of scholarly records on quantum technologies in the context of social sciences, emphasizing related urban problematics and challenges. Principal component analysis and agglomerative hierarchical clustering reveal two types of quantum technologies most useful for city planners and managers: quantum communication and quantum computing. Accordingly, we perform a qualitative thematic synthesis of related scholarly records, emphasizing the negative and positive aspects of both types of urban quantum technologies.}

abstract = {Natural disasters have caused significant financial and economic losses. One prominent way to combat these losses is crowdfunding. Donation-based crowdfunding platforms have been the backbone for disaster relief operations (DRO), but the engagement of donors with these platforms needs significant attention. This study aims to understand how gamification is used as a tool for understanding the behaviour of donors on crowdfunding platforms for DRO. The study uses the Civic Voluntary Model (CVM) to propose the conceptual framework and collects empirical data from 321 respondents to test the hypothesis. The study uses information quality and voluntariness as moderating variables and the model also controls for ownership of the crowdfunding platform and previous experience of donation. The results confirm that gamification positively impacts the behaviour of donors, which then leads to higher participation in crowdfunding channels. Both information quality and voluntary behaviour of donors have significant moderating effects that help in understanding the behaviour of donors and their participation in crowdfunding platforms. The results indicate that previous experience of making donations does not have a significant impact on the behaviour and actions of donors. The study thus brings a fresh perspective to using game mechanics along with understanding the quality of information on crowdfunding platforms to attract and sustain donations in DRO.}

Corporations are integrating sustainable practices at the business process level via Sustainable Enterprise Resource Planning (S-ERP). However, a recognised shortfall of S-ERP systems lies in their potential inability to integrate sustainability metrics across all business functions holistically. To navigate this limitation, our study introduces the application of Transaction Cost Theory (TCT). By treating business processes as input-output systems, we apply this theory to quantify sustainability likelihood and overall losses. This novel approach bridges the gap, allowing for the comprehensive integration of sustainability metrics across all processes. The essence of our methodology is to leverage static input data collected by S-ERP regarding environmental impact and to extrapolate this data to provide a broader understanding of potential losses and gains. We've tested and validated this approach through two comprehensive case studies; one is about sustainable product design and development, and the other is about the sustainability evaluation of modular versus conventional construction methods. The results inform the formulation of robust sustainability policies at the business process level for systems akin to S-ERP, paving the way for more sustainable business practices.}

It also creates more opportunities for business to achieve sustainable success; however, both scholars and managers are still having relative difficulty in fully grasping customer behavior in terms of technology acceptance during the Industry 4.0. This study aims to investigate the possible factors that drive Chinese customers' willingness to utilize facial recognition payment. The findings showed that factors such as perceived enjoyment, facilitating conditions, personal innovativeness, coupon availability, perceived ease of use (PEOU), perceived usefulness (PU), and users' attitude are main drivers of customers' decisions to use facial recognition payment. Also, we found that gender differences exist in the adoption of facial recognition payment. Facilitating conditions have stronger effects on men's attitude towards usage, while coupon availability shapes female users' perception of usefulness more powerfully. By testing the extended technology acceptance model (TAM), this study seeks to gain more insight into technological change within society. Overall, investigation of the drivers of customer intention to use facial recognition payment, and exploration of their internal relationships will fulfil theoretical requirements and lead to a better understanding of customers' technology acceptance behavior, which in turn will provide greater theoretical and practical guidance for scholars and managers.}

A detailed secondary data analysis of the country-specific systems is presented, followed by the analysis of patents and companies in both countries to understand better how the development, management and transfer of technology affected the different factors and the global patterns. An effective approach of acquiring technology for local enterprises as well as market development entry mode for the foreign technology holding companies are both identified. Accessing technology through licensing, entering joint ventures, or acquiring knowledge-intensive companies can be identified as common and often successful industry approaches.

In the inference model, we analyzed the determinants that affect the business performance and R&D investment performance of SMEs in PPINs, using generalized linear models. The prediction model utilized a machine learning based ensemble model and the method of linking heterogeneous DBs based on privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM). The findings of this study indicate that while PPINs do not have a significant effect on business performance, they do have a positive correlation to R&D investment. This study also proposes two prediction models for forecasting increases in R&D investment by SMEs, which is considered to be an indicator of PPIN performance. These two models can be respectively used in cases where the features of the companies targeted for prediction can be known in advance and in cases where the features are unknown.}

Digital innovation challenges established product-centric companies whose innovation management capabilities are insufficient to manage the reconfiguration and transformation necessary for digital innovation and technology. Recent research has introduced different concepts of for example, digital readiness, digitalization capabilities, and digital innovation readiness. However, these concepts have two shortcomings for use in practice and empirical research: most concepts are theoretical in nature, with limited empirically validated measures. As such, this study takes a dynamic capability view to synthesize prior literature on the organizational antecedents of digital innovation and develops a framework for the micro-foundations of digital innovation capability. By applying a mixed-method approach, existing concepts are extended through qualitative research and then translated into a multi-dimensional measurement instrument. This multi-item operationalization is then subjected to scale validation using quantitative research methods. The results show that a company's digital innovation capability is founded upon seven micro-foundations – digital focus, digital innovation process, digital mindset, digital innovation network, digital technology capability, data management, and overcoming digital innovation resistance – that facilitate established companies in sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring digital innovation.}

Required data are collected with a quantitative approach and two self-designed questionnaires were distributed to customers and employees of commercial banks in China. The gathered data were examined using the structural equation modeling technique. The results of this study reveal that the perceived usefulness (PU) of FTPs has positive and significant impacts on customer satisfaction, low expectation of bank employee assistance, bank's service quality and employee work efficiency. Additionally, the perceived difficulty of use (PD) of FTPs has negative and significant impacts on customer satisfaction and low expectation of assistance. Interestingly, there is a positive and significant relationship between PD and banks' service quality and work efficiency, meaning that the service quality and work efficiency can reduce some shortcomings of using FTPs. This study recognizes the need to enhance the understanding of FTPs on non-financial firm performance. This is the first study that helps commercial banks in China understand the perception of FTPs from both customer and employee perspectives.}

Moreover, it proposes, develops and tests empirically a comprehensive extended version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in the context of DPDSs, leveraging perceived privacy risks and trust. Using a panel of UK consumers, we find that perceived trust positively influences both usefulness and ease of use. These constructs, in turn, positively affect attitude towards using DPDSs, which ultimately increases the intention to use DPDSs. Privacy risk does not moderate any of the investigated relationships, thus suggesting that trust is a key underlying mechanism enhancing the acceptance of DPDS. Hence, theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.}

Therefore, we theorize and examine how ITI capability affects NPD performance taking into account market knowledge as a mediator and the innovation process formality as a moderator. We provide empirical evidence that ITI capability is not only directly and positively related to NPD performance, but also indirectly by means of market knowledge. The results further show that the innovation process formality weakens this relationship. Overall, this study extends the understanding of how ITI capability influences NPD performance and it can be helpful for managers who seek superior NPD performance.}

A statistical technique called small area estimation (SAE) is utilized to improve the accuracy of the estimates. It involves using both the 2016 Community Survey (CS2016) and the Population Census 2011 (PC2011) and applying methods such as the log-transformed spatial Fay-Herriot (FH) and the hierarchical Bayes spatial FH models. According to the results, the digital statistics estimates generated by the SAE methods at the local municipality level are more precise and efficient than the direct design-based estimates. In other words, combining the CS2016 and PC2011 datasets with the spatial information resulted in more precise estimates. The results also indicate a digital divide between men and women. Specifically, South African men tend to use the internet more than women. However, disparities in cell phone ownership have diminished at the national level, and the gap in some local municipalities, such as Kheis, Midvaal, Kgatelopele, Thabazimbi, and Karoo Hoogland, is >30 %. The results provide evidence of the digital gender divide within South African households at the local municipality level. Indeed, as the Fourth Industrial Revolution is now underway, the analysis of digital statistics can provide policymakers with a clear picture of South Africa's readiness level to welcome this revolution.}

abstract = {This research proposes and tests mechanisms for defining and identifying the critical online consumer reviews that firms could prioritize to optimize their online response strategies, while incorporating the latest artificial intelligence (AI) technology to deal with the overwhelming volume of information. Three sets of analytical tools are introduced: Heuristic Processing, Linguistic Feature Analysis, and Deep Learning-based Natural Language Processing (NLP), to extract review information. Twelve algorithms to classify critical reviews were developed accordingly and empirically tested for their effectiveness. Our econometric analysis of 110,146 online reviews from a chain operation in hospitality industry over seven years identifies six outstanding algorithms. Firm value rating, comment length, valence, and certain consumer emotions, in addition to past comment-response behavior, are found to be superior in predicting incoming review criticality. However, the service attributes such as urgency to reply and the feasibility of actions to take are not as informative.}

The Internet of Things (IoT) enables new business opportunities for data-driven transformation in organisations. The emergence of the IoT concept has resulted in numerous definitions, with earlier references primarily focussed on the technological aspects. This has hindered the broader diffusion of the term IoT as, arguably, the definitions do not integrate other non-technological elements of IoT and focus more on business and service provisions. To resolve this, our research identifies the most significant building blocks required in designing an IoT system. This is accomplished through a methodological review of 122 definitions and their consolidation into a novel definitional framework. The definitional framework unifies the traditional technology focus of the earlier definitions and integrates additional elements that are likely to increase the adoption of a comprehensive definition to support the development of future business applications. Furthermore, the framework serves as a reference set for scholarly societies and standards organisations who, in the future, can be tasked with formulating a definition of IoT, as has been the case with the NIST definition of Cloud Computing, which was preceded by several academic studies on defining the term.}

Consequently, how data-centric B2B platforms create value (i.e., who they involve, what activities they allow to do, and how they manage sides' relationships) remains unclear. To address this gap, this paper analyzes the cases of three data-centric B2B platforms (i.e., MindSphere, Skywise, Open-es). Authors (i) categorize the sides managing data on these platforms (i.e., clients, providers, enablers), (ii) identify how these sides relate to perform data acquisition and manipulation activities, and (iii) illustrate the specific governance mechanisms supporting these relationships. Finally, a model discusses the goals, the transactional and innovation behaviors, and value creation mechanisms in data-centric B2B platforms. By adopting a value creation perspective of data-centric B2B platforms, this paper contributes to both theoretical and managerial debates surrounding B2B platforms.}

However, due to the many obstacles of financial burdens, technical thresholds, and talent shortages, digital transformation has become a challenging task for entrepreneurial Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs). Additionally, many competitive digital transformation solutions on the market cause confusion when enterprises must choose one. This study drew a new information error-driven T-spherical fuzzy cloud algorithm to evaluate digital transformation solutions of entrepreneurial SMEs and support its selection. First, an evaluation index system for the digital transformation solution of entrepreneurial SMEs was established from four aspects. Then, a new concept of a T-spherical fuzzy cloud was defined to represent the evaluation information of the indicators. Additionally, a T-spherical Fuzzy Cloud Weighted Heronian Mean (T-SFCWHM) operator was used to aggregate the evaluation information. Afterward, an evaluation and selection decision framework for the digital transformation solution of entrepreneurial SMEs based on the T-SFCWHM operator was developed. Further, a practical example was given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, a discussion of the findings in our study was conducted, and the conclusions were summarized.}

Owing to the government intervention and consumers’ low-carbon preferences, the market share is influenced by the carbon emission reduction technology improvement of the supplier and manufacturer and the low carbon advertisement of the retailer. We then construct the differential game model of three-echelon supply chain from the perspectives of decentralized, governmental intervention, supplier cost sharing and governmental intervention, and retailer cost sharing and governmental intervention. Main results are as follows: (1) the manufacturer and supplier's active investment in emission reduction technologies and retailer's advertisement will consistently increase the profits of supply chain members; (2) given that the government subsidizes the manufacturer's carbon emission reduction technology through tax exemption or tax reduction, the manufacturer will always fall into a prisoner's dilemma once the government's carbon emission limit exceeds a certain threshold range; (3) consumer preferences will have a positive effect on manufacturer and supplier's emission reduction strategies, whereas it has nothing to do with retailer's advertisement, and retailer's investment in advertising only depends on manufacturer's subsidy policy; (4) compared with decentralized scenario, Pareto improvement can always be realized whether the manufacturer chooses to cooperate with the supplier or retailer. Our results can provide theoretical basis for the carbon emission strategy of three-echelon supply chain members in low-carbon environment.}

They are positive toward the potential profit margin, which is considered higher than that of incumbent competitors. However, these models are creating unique challenges, such as limited assets and sustainability restrictions, that traditional organizations are unlikely to face. Thus, building resilience against threatened disruptions should be addressed to solve these challenges. Nonetheless, to date, there is limited systematic scholarly inquiry into how organizational resilience in platform-based sharing business is achieved. This study uses a case study method to explore the resilience mechanism of platform-based sharing economy ventures by emphasizing the role of absorptive capacity. Findings demonstrate that continuous absorptive capacity facilitates three cycled resilience stages: anticipation of changes, minimization of vulnerability and exploitation of shared resources, and winners take all.

A cross-theory approach is used to highlight the connections between ambidexterity and knowledge management theories as a basis to explore the benefits of K-AMB capabilities for SMEs. The study investigates how the focus on knowledge exploitation by SMEs limits innovation which can be reconciled using cloud computing by creating multiple ambidextrous knowledge opportunities. In relation to cloud computing and knowledge ambidexterity, the study is the first to measure the effects of a temporal lag in the K-AMB processes resulting in enhanced employee-driven innovation. The results showed that over a 12-month period, employee-driven innovation was significantly amplified from the application of cloud computing that supported more sophisticated ambidextrous processes of knowledge management. The results significantly shift mindsets about the revelatory value of cloud computing to promote K-AMB in SMEs. We draw novel insights to the theory of ambidexterity by proposing that digital technologies and employee innovation contexts lie side-by-side and play an important role in building K-AMB capabilities in SMEs.}

Despite its proven capabilities, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) can flourish only if users in the medical sector willingly use these devices in their daily routine work. Drawing on behavioural reasoning theory and its implication in explaining user behaviour, this study aims to shed light on hospital practitioners’ reasons for and against resistance to IoMT. We proposed an integrative theoretical framework that combines system, information, and individual positive and negative factors to understand and explain clinical users’ scepticism and resistance toward IoMT. We benefit from a multi-analytical approach including symmetrical (net effect) and configurational analysis to test this theoretical framework. Our study contributes to the literature by proposing new insights into IoMT users’ decision-making, considering a dual approach that simultaneously explains positive and negative pathways toward scepticism and resistance. Empirically, this study advances our knowledge of users’ resistance rationality that could lead to improved managerial policies for introducing and successfully implementing IoMT technologies in hospitals.}

They do not operate from the office space or from the corporate setting. Frontline employees directly interact with their customers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many frontline employees experienced numerous challenges as most of the places there were full or partial lockdown imposed by the government agencies and the frontline employees could not be able to directly connect with their customers. Not many studies are there which investigated the issue of resource integration, dynamic capabilities, and engineering management abilities of the frontline employees such as technological capability, emotional intelligence, and psychological capability which perceived to influence the frontline employee adaptability and organization performance. In this background, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between frontline employee adaptability and organization performance during COVID-19 pandemic from technological, emotional, and psychological perspectives. With the help of dynamic capability view and different adaptability theories, a theoretical model has been developed conceptually. Later the conceptual model has been validated using partial least square – structural equation modeling technique considering 412 respondents from frontline employees of different organizations in Asia and EMEA. The study found that frontline employees’ dynamic capabilities and engineering management abilities significantly and positively impact employee adaptability which in turn impact the performance of the organization mediating through employee job satisfaction and employee performance.}

In order to quantitatively measure people's evaluation of data utilization, we used contingent valuation method (CVM) in a survey by questionnaire of 5986 people to find out their willingness to pay for data utilization. The results of the empirical analysis show that all hypotheses were supported. We can obtain the following two policies and service providers implications. First, there is a privacy paradox with respect to data utilization, so the service providers need to create an environment where people can choose the level of data utilization. Second, it is necessary to design a rule that takes diverse values into account.}

A top-down approach is adopted to construct a financial proxy-based sentiment index completed with sentiment extracted from automobile news and customer reviews. The paper uses a text mining approach to holistically measure customer sentiment's impact on investor sentiment and stock prices. The study was initially performed at the overall individual stock from the Nifty Auto NSE but focused on the top three passenger vehicle manufacturing companies i.e., Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, and Eicher. It was found that the sentiment index was augmented with news and customer reviews allows predicting more accurately NIFTY AUTO stock price movements. This implies that customer sentiment is a major driver of investor sentiment which in turn impacts the stock market and the firm value. Thus, the present study is an integrated approach to holistically measure customer sentiment's impact on investor sentiment and stock prices.}

Accordingly, a theoretical model was constructed to analyze 2555 valid questionnaires collected from 16 districts in Shanghai, revealing the following results: (1) Subjective norms and perceived behavioral control indirectly affect WSB only through offline behavioral intentions; (2) PGE and IP have direct and indirect effects on WSB through both on- and offline behavioral intentions; and, (3) Under the moderating effects of house prices and age in megacities, PGE and IP exhibited irregular and U-shaped effects, respectively. In addition, the results indicate spatial differences in WSB as a function of the neighborhood (stranger, acquaintance, and semi-acquaintance neighborhoods) and as a driving mechanism (weak mobilization–strong participation, strong mobilization–strong participation, and strong mobilization–weak participation). These findings provide a reference for formulating targeted waste separation policies, improving social mobilization mechanisms, ensuring timely information dissemination, and achieving sustainable household WSB.}

By utilizing the data of additional reviews (ARs), an innovative social media module for customers to express follow-up opinions that complement their initial reviews, we examine the impact of MR treatment on the customers' AR valence. We leverage the insight that the observability of MR at the time of the responded customer posts an AR is a crucial condition to the impact of the MR, and thus regard the observability of MR as an exogenous treatment for model identification. Fixed effects models with extensive control variables are proposed to estimate the MR treatment effects. The results show that MRs have significant positive impacts on customers' satisfaction in ARs. Further explorations show that the positive impacts are mainly due to the positive effects of MRs on nonpositive initial reviews (MR-Ns), suggesting that MR-Ns are an effective management tool for customer complaints. Moreover, this study identifies MR delay as a boundary condition for the internality of MRs because MR delay negatively moderates the positive impacts of MRs. Therefore, companies should promptly respond to customers' negative opinions in their reviews. This study is among the very first to clearly identify the internality of MRs on the responded customers’ satisfaction. We show that the existing results on the externality of MRs are not directly applicable to the internality of MRs, highlighting the novelty of this study. The obtained new insights provide practical guidelines for companies to adjust their intervention strategies on e-commerce platforms.}

To address this gap, this study investigates international alliance partnerships in the Japan-Taiwan context, emphasizing external resources and inter-firm linkages as competitive advantage sources. It examines resource management and alliance portfolio configuration within traditional industries, specifically Japanese-Taiwanese alliances in China's automotive and machine tool manufacturing sectors. Findings shed light on the intricate nature of alliance portfolio configuration in traditional manufacturing, involving careful partner selection and resource adjustment through exploitation and exploration. The research offers valuable insights into dynamic alliance development and factors influencing innovation. It presents three propositions and identifies trust, equity commitment, firm capabilities, proactiveness, alliance resource redundancy, and domain segmentation as driving factors. This study contributes to theoretical and empirical knowledge, examining research implications while acknowledging limitations. Future research directions should address these limitations and examine further avenues, deepening our understanding of the complexities involved in driving innovation through interorganizational relationships in industries that lay the foundations for economic growth.}

Hence, the present study proposes a framework for analyzing I5.0 enablers for achieving sustainability by integrating human values with technology. To achieve the objectives, this study was conducted in three different phases: 1) through extensive review, the list of criteria and enablers was identified; 2) Pythagorean fuzzy Delphi was used to validate the enablers against criteria; 3) a hybrid approach of Pythagorean fuzzy analytical hierarchy process-combined compromise solution was employed to calculate the weights of selected criteria and determine the ranks of enablers. A sensitivity analysis was then performed to check the robustness of this framework. The findings show that the criterion of personal customization obtained the highest weight followed by human-machine collaboration, which will create a smart cognitive environment for humans. Human intelligence is used in more important places, which will help society focus on developing social values. The authors also put forward seven propositions about adopting I5.0 enablers for best results, taking examples from existing case studies and helping industrialists adopt I5.0 methods.}

Applying a crisp-set qualitative comparative analysis to 130 smart city initiatives in Switzerland, we develop a three-dimensional framework of business models for digital sustainability. The framework comprises 12 theoretically possible business model types, representing distinct business model configurations. We contribute to the digital sustainability and the microfoundations literatures by analyzing, explaining, and classifying the diversity of digitally enabled business models in the context of smart cities.}

Using data collected from 409 Chinese manufacturing firms during the COVID-19 pandemic, and by disaggregating business networks into two dimensions—network breadth and network depth—our findings show, firstly, that both network breadth and network depth are positively correlated to the organizational resilience capacity of firms; secondly, that these relationships are mediated by firms’ ambidextrous learning; and thirdly, that the positive effects of network breadth and network depth on organizational resilience capacity are stronger when the firms’ digital technology levels are higher. Furthermore, through additional analysis, we find that the positive impact of business networks on organizational resilience capacity is stronger for non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs) than it is for SOEs, and also that the moderating effect of digital technology on the relationship between business networks and organizational resilience capacity is greater for non-SOEs than it is for SOEs. These findings provide new insight into how a firm's business network, in combination with its ambidextrous learning and level of digital technology, affects its organizational resilience capacity development, which helps it survive a crisis for future sustainable development.}

We propose a five-actor model and argue that one stakeholder - the consumer - is a central driver of sustainability. Consumers’ sustainability-focused behaviors drive the market for sustainable products and services, leading to sustainable firm and investor behavior. Beyond a conceptual model, our empirical study shows that innovations in social and environmental dimensions drive customer loyalty to the brands. Consumers aware of the consequences and risks associated with unsustainable consumption tend to consume more responsibly. Service firms integrating a stakeholder perspective into the design of their service systems perform better on the triple bottom line.}

Digitalization refers to the use of information and communication technologies (ICT), which has resulted in an easier way of acquiring goods and services but at a larger scale. Meanwhile, online shopping and unconventional promotions have also changed individual lifestyles. While the world is demanding broader actions against climate change, how and to what extent the digital transformation of modern society can affect consumption and its associated emissions is an important but uncertain question to address. This paper takes China as an example and explores households' digital activities and consumption behaviors from a nationwide survey. As a result, we demonstrate that wider digital adoption was overwhelmed by larger embedded carbon emissions, mainly from consuming larger scale of non-basis goods and generating indirect carbon emissions. Although the overall association between digital adoption and the household carbon emissions was positive, this article finds that digital adoption indeed promoted pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors which further declined the emissions. Likewise, city's digital development declined the positive impact of digital adoption on the household direct emissions. Furthermore, empirical results show that social network, social trust and local satisfaction played significant roles in leading lower household carbon emissions in the digital era. Thus, this study has important policy implications for China's commitment to carbon neutrality in 2060 from demand side.}

Therefore we propose and demonstrate a hierarchical model that selectively combines topics at varying levels of generality. The resultant analysis, which is based on non-negative matrix factorization, reveals four distinct branches of technology forecasting work, composed of seven distinct topics. Each topic and branch are examined individually through a detailed examination of terms and keywords. Representative works and authors in each of the branches are also identified. The method enables the examination of the complex structure of knowledge in a scientific journal in a succinct representation.

Using the case of the Nigerian digital financial ecosystem, which comprises about forty-three organisations, this study traces and explores the stages of ecosystem emergence: initiation, envisioning, enacting, momentum, control/optimisation and enlivening. The results show that the Nigerian digital financial services (DFS) ecosystem emerged from the need to leverage strategic partnerships across several industries for efficient value creation and delivery. The emergence of the DFS ecosystem, though organic, evolved without any form of design intentionality by the operators and regulators, as most relationships and interactions were loosely coupled. The study highlights the need for ecosystem actors such as governments and regulators to provide more clarity on incentives and ecosystem rules in order to overcome the limitations imposed by system-level and institutional barriers that constrain its legitimacy and growth and the launch of new initiatives.}

Vehicle insurance accounts for a large part of the income of insurance companies, and retaining regular clients has proved economical, making car insurance clients’ churn management a priority. Meanwhile, clients’ churn will determine companies’ financial status and reflect the service and management level of the company. This paper proposes a new model, i.e., combined the Cox model with variable penalties (Lasso, SCAD, and MCP) to model the clients’ churn problems and determine the crucial factors that affect clients’ decisions, based on their personal information and behavior data, which are provided by a large insurance company in China. This model is proved to be successful in identifying the client churning and making comparisons among the penalties. The variable penalties model reveals the most important factor about clients’ churn problems, which can provide a reliable basis for the product development of insurance companies. MCP creates the greatest sparsity but consequently loses some information. We suggest using SCAD in the model, as it balances the sparsity and information reservation. Furthermore, a new approach is proposed to building a dynamic threshold of churning probabilities, which companies can use to manage their clients more flexibly. In this way, clients who are prone to churn can be identified in advance, and the maintenance cost of client management can be reduced accordingly.}

In this article, we present the findings of a case study on the way algorithms can be exploited in the electrical sector to shed light on these issues. We then develop a framework to theorise how the organisational mechanisms associated with absorptive capacity influence the way algorithms can be exploited to convert data into relevant knowledge for operational decision-making. Our emerging framework reveals that to convert data into relevant knowledge for operational decision-making, the involvement of line employees and liaison roles are required to introduce system-level knowledge that algorithms are able to capture less effectively. Additionally, more formalisation is needed in operational work to ensure the quality of the data that feed such algorithms. Finally, socialisation tactics facilitate the convergence between the knowledge produced from algorithms and the experiential knowledge of line employees.}

With an aim to assess the current landscape and inform future research, our review summarizes and analyzes the methodological techniques and approaches used for categorically coding Instagram-based data about tobacco. By using relevant keywords, a literature search was performed in June 2021 within three databases – Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed – identifying 304 articles. PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematics Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were adopted to direct further analysis and reporting. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were used by two reviewers to systematically assess the eligibility of studies resulting in 27 studies. Key characteristics (product studied, focus of the study, details about data collection, and coding and coded categories) from each study were extracted and analyzed in detail. E-cigarettes were the most frequently investigated tobacco product followed by the hookah/water pipe, cigars/cigarillos, betel nut, and Heated Tobacco Products (HTP). As the data source, Netlytic and Instagram's API/website were commonly used. The coding methods broadly encompass human coding and machine-learning techniques. As a rich and organic source, Instagram-based data is valuable for the surveillance of various forms of tobacco as well as substance use. Open and simpler data collection tools are needed as collecting Instagram data has become challenging. Blending hand-coding with machine-learning techniques may advance future research to classify broader representation and understand nuanced behaviors around tobacco portrayals on Instagram.}

These accounts, though, are largely anecdotal, and the volume of academic research in the area has remained rather confined. To address this paucity of insights, particularly after the onset of the pandemic, which has brought the healthcare sector to the fore, we conducted a qualitative study among healthcare providers (doctors, nurses, and other clinical staff). The key objective of our study was to identify the perceived barriers and other inhibiting factors that impede individuals’ adoption and continued usage of e-health innovations. We conducted our study in the United Kingdom and analyzed the data using the classic approach of manual content analysis. Through these efforts, we identified barriers from the perspectives of healthcare providers (task-related, patient-care, and system barriers), healthcare organizations (threat perception and infrastructural barriers), patients (usability and resource barriers), and end-users in general (self-efficacy, tradition, and image barriers). Our study makes a noteworthy theoretical contribution by proposing a conceptual framework for resistance to e-health innovations that is grounded in innovation resistance theory (IRT). We also make some useful suggestions for practice that have the potential to accelerate the diffusion of e-health innovations.}

Conversely, in other industries – with the exception of those producing commodities – the firms that achieve superior returns are those that use IT to support differentiation.

Although ICSAs are highly valued by enterprises, consumers have lower continuous interaction intention for them. The initial response content will largely affect consumers' continuous interaction intention, which directly determines the ICSAs' efficiency. Therefore, making an effective strategy for ICSAs' initial response has become a focus for enterprises. Previous studies mainly investigated ICSAs from the perspective of the complete interaction, and ignored the initial interaction. Based on the theory of computers as social actors and the stereotype content model, this study investigates the impact of ICSAs' initial response content (functional content vs. social content) on consumers' continuous interaction intention. Through two online scenario-based experiments, the results show that initial response content has a significant influence on consumers' continuous intention. The initial response content impacts consumers' trust and affect through perceived warmth and perceived competence, which further influence consumers’ continuous interaction intention. Furthermore, the functional response content has a greater impact on perceived competence, while the social response content has a stronger influence on perceived warmth. In addition, the effect of initial response content on perceived warmth and on perceived competence are moderated by interaction initiation modes. These findings enrich the literature on ICSAs and offer practical implications for e-retailers seeking to make effective initial response strategies.}

abstract = {This study focuses on the production phase of drug development and examines approaches and their progress indicators for enhancing the quality of pharmaceutical products and attaining consistency in Pharma 4.0. The research is conducted in three interconnected stages. In the first stage, a scientometric approach is incorporated into a detailed analysis of past studies, utilizing bibliometric analysis techniques. Following this, a narrative literature review is conducted based on the outcomes of the first stage to gain deeper insights into the selected technologies. Approaches for effective quality improvement include incorporating Quality by Design (QbD) for product and process development, utilizing Process Analytical Technology (PAT) in pharmaceutical processes, and adapting Real-Time Release Testing (RTRT) for quality control of raw materials, semi-products, and final products. While each of these approaches should be effectively implemented, integration with others is also necessary to maintain consistent quality. In the final stage of this paper, the authors make the first attempt to present a future-oriented integrated quality consistency system under the Pharma 4.0 philosophy, which encompasses effective production for quality improvement and consistency.}

In fact, during the crisis numerous digital redesigns of businesses occurred to pursue both continuity and competitive advantage. Among these, the food retail sector has undergone under the pressure of the crisis intense digital changes, which, however, have not yet been investigated under the theoretical lens of BMI. To fill this gap, the paper analyzes the digital actions taken during the pandemic crisis by two large food retailers, namely Walmart and Carrefour. Covering a wide temporal interval of the pandemic evolution and reviewing multiple geographical markets, the authors interpreted the grocer's digital responses to the crisis in terms of innovation in value creation and capture mechanisms. As a result, three phases of digital BMI have been reconstructed, each characterized by specific mechanisms of value creation and capture experienced by the two grocers during the pandemic. Leveraging these findings, the paper proposes a model capable of defining how digital BMI takes place in response to crises. Results broaden theoretical knowledge and practical suggestions on digital BMI in terms of enabling factors, actionable value mechanisms, and future business opportunities.}

However, customers are often reluctant to grant data access. Although prior research has identified lack of data access as an inhibitor of digital servitization, the peculiarities of data exchange in digital servitization have not been considered until now. Therefore, it remains unclear which intra- and interorganizational challenges emerge within and between providers and customers that lead to lack of data access. This study uses paradox theory to address the complex and multi-faceted phenomenon of data access in digital servitization. Specifically, 40 in-depth interviews with managers across a wide range of industries revealed four paradoxes inhibiting data access and comprising one overarching interorganizational paradox in the form of (1) the need for access vs. the need for shielding, and three intra-organizational paradoxes in the form of (2) product-focused identity vs. digital-focused identity, (3) data appreciation vs. data depreciation, and (4) goodwill perception vs. opportunism perception. To address each paradox, this study also provides a comprehensive set of coping strategies. The findings may help providers facilitate their digital servitization efforts by addressing the identified data access paradoxes that they and their customers face.}

As a value co-creation strategy, the innovative design of smart PSS involves multiple stakeholders, and the decisions in the concept design stage are especially crucial for its success throughout the whole lifespan. However, recent studies have focused on developing the design methodology or decision approaches for it, with an absence of the systematic decision framework for smart PSS innovation design. Most of them held the customer-centric viewpoint without considering the aspect of multi-stakeholder collaborative innovation. To fill the gaps, this study proposes the UNISON framework of model-based innovation for smart PSS design from the perspective of collaborative innovation, to assist its innovative design and decision-making in the concept design stage. To illustrate the structured procedures and demonstrate the validity of this framework, it was applied in an empirical study for the innovative design of smart drainage equipment-service system. Moreover, the performance of the proposed framework has been discussed from both theoretical and practical aspects. This study can provide systematic guidance for developing smart PSS innovative design strategies to facilitate multi-stakeholder collaborative innovation.}

Attractiveness represents the appealingness or interestingness of news to an individual, while timeliness indicates the recency of news. Existing research on news click prediction models has ignored those two important variables. There is a lack of exploration and understanding of how to represent them in a predictive model and how effective and valuable they are to the prediction performance of a model. To fill these gaps, in this research, we propose a deep news click prediction (DNCP) model that integrates attractiveness and timeliness of news in an attention-based deep neural network for predicting news clicks. We also propose new measures for those two variables. Empirical evaluation using two real-world datasets shows that the DNCP model outperforms a variety of baseline models. The findings of this research provide several novel research contributions and practical implications for improving news click prediction.}

To profit from digitalization, providers and customers tend to move away from transactional product-centric model to relational service-oriented engagement. This relational transformation is brought about through digital servitization. However, current knowledge about how providers and customers transform their relationship to achieve benefits from digital servitization is lacking. This paper addresses that knowledge gap by applying the relational view theory to a study of four provider-customer relationships engaged in digital servitization. The results provide evidence for four relational components – complementary digitalization capabilities, relation-specific digital assets, digitally enabled knowledge-sharing routines, and partnership governance – that enable providers and customers to profit from digital servitization. A key contribution is the development of a relational transformation framework for digital servitization that provides an overview of how the four relational components evolve as the relationship progresses. In doing so, we contribute to the emerging servitization literature by offering key relational insights into the interdependence of activities throughout the transformation phases of provider-customer relationships in digital servitization.}

This study investigates how the varying degree of anthropomorphism in robots affect customers’ perceived service quality. A research model with associated hypotheses was developed based on affect-as-information theory. The study collected data from 455 randomly selected customers who were served by either a mechanical robot (automatic on-demand coffee maker) or an anthropomorphic robot (travel information assistant). The results of the study showed that anthropomorphism has a significant positive impact on intimacy between robots and humans, intimacy has significant positive impact on customers’ perceived service quality, and intimacy has a mediating role on the relationship between anthropomorphism and service quality.}

The platform with operational data of each retail store can effectively help retailers select marketable products and then improve their operational efficiency. We first investigate the motivation of retailers in accepting the platform digital empowerment (PDE) and joining the platform. We find that the retailer should join the platform and choose PDE only when the sales effort cost coefficient is high and the effect of sales effort on demand is weak. Second, we investigate the influence of the number of retailers on the platform network effect and find that the more retailers on the platform, the more profits the retailers and the e-commerce platform will make. Besides, the retailers’ sales efforts and the PDE level will increase. Third, we study the PDE decisions under the unconstrained and decentralized control system (DC), the decentralized control system with revenue sharing contract (RS) and the decentralized control system with profit sharing contract (PS), respectively. We find that the platform’s profit in PS is the highest among these systems if the sales effort cost coefficient is high. Furthermore, for these systems, the PDE level under DC is always the highest if the effort cost is low; otherwise, the PDE level under PS is the highest. In addition, the sales effort under DC is always the highest if PDE is employed, that is, nether RS nor PS can effectively promote the retailer’s sales effort.}

The PSS providers in our study applied both internal and external governance mechanisms to regulate value co-creation. Internally, they relied on formal organisational setups and informal coordination between product, service and digital divisions. Externally, they had strong relational governance mechanisms supported by appropriate contractual governance mechanisms. As frontline (field) interactions became an important factor for realising value co-creation, PSS providers also attempted to develop individual-based psychological governance to complement group-based relational governance. Our findings reveal five challenges in managing the governance mechanisms: (1) orchestrating all digital resources and capabilities, especially managing the incompatibility and isolation of different digital tools in product and service divisions; (2) managing all relations in one platform that can embrace customer relationship management (CRM), supplier relationship management (SRM) and form relations with emerging actors such as authorities; (3) designing appropriate contractual governance to measure co-created value from economic, societal and environmental perspectives, and govern data ownership and security; (4) managing the interplay between contractual and relational governance mechanisms during PSS agreement implementation; and (5) developing psychological governance for frontline staff. We direct PSS providers towards essential aspects that require attention when developing governance mechanisms by identifying these challenges. Moreover, identifying such challenges will allow policymakers, practitioners, and scholars to jointly develop standards, policies and guidelines in these increasingly prevalent ecosystem business arrangements.}

But in India and other third world countries, healthcare monitoring is poor compared to other countries in the world, in spite of it being affordable. The global healthcare smart wearable healthcare (SWH) devices market is expected to rise up at a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 5.6% and by 2020 it is expected to reach 25 Billion (GVR Report, 2016). The growing incidences of lifestyle diseases, sedentary lifestyle, busy work schedules, technological advancements in healthcare monitoring devices, and increased usage of remote devicesseems to be some of the important factors fuelling this growth. Some of the major players in this segment are Abbott Laboratories, Philips Healthcare, Life Watch, GE Healthcare, Omron Healthcare, Siemens Healthcare and Honeywell International Inc. etc. But in spite of the healthcare monitoring devices are being predicted to be technologically innovative and providing advanced as well as basic health care monitoring features and available in various price ranges based on the features, we wanted to empirically study the attitude towards adoption of such devices in India. India has traditionally been having a very lackadaisical attitude towards healthcare monitoring. In such a context, what would be the factors influencing the adoption of SWH devices. Remote health monitoring can enhance the nature of wellbeing administration and to lessen the aggregate expense in human services by maintaining a strategic distance from pointless hospitalizations and guaranteeing that the individuals who need critical consideration get it sooner. This empirical investigation would provide a detailed insight as to how these wearable Internet Of Things devices would bring about a revolution in the healthcare industry. It would also provide the future prospect of IOT devices in this sector and how the probability of increase in its usage can be increased with time. The paper explores intrusiveness (INTR), Comfort (C), perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (EOU) of SWH devices. The study hypothesized the Impact of PU and EOU, INTR and C on attitude and intention to use towards adoption of SWH devices. Partial Least Square Structured Equation Modeling (PLS – SEM) methodology was applied to explore the relationships between the concepts and hypothesis. The data was collected from 273 respondents. The age group of the respondents was between 25 and 40 years. The results indicated that intrusiveness and comfort do not have a significant direct impact on Intention to use BI (Behavior Intention) BI SWH devices. At the same time Intrusiveness had a significant impact on PU of SWH devices and Comfort has a strong significant impact on PU and EOU of smart wearables. The research has strong implications in the current emerging context of smart wearables, their design and effectiveness. Also the research can have lasting implications on elderly health and well-being. There are very few empirical studies in the area of SWH devices. Most of the studies till now are conceptual studies or providing technology architectures and frameworks. The research in this area is still at a very nascent stage and very few studies have been done to explore the use and adoption of SWH devices.}

Unlike other approaches, we recommend combining external and internal company data sources for the purpose of enhancing the performance of forecasting algorithms using multivariate LSTM with the optimal hyperparameters. In addition, we also propose a method to optimize hyperparameters for hybrid algorithms for detecting anomalies in time series data. The proposed approaches will be applied to both benchmarking datasets and real data in fashion retail. The obtained results show that the LSTM Autoencoder based method leads to better performance for anomaly detection compared to the LSTM based method suggested in a previous study.

Based on the analysis of existing models, an innovation management model has been proposed in this paper that makes it possible to analyze the process of co-creation in companies in this sector. The results obtained indicate that the generation of added value in ICT services requires the implementation of co-creation processes in which different actors are involved. In this context, customers, partners, and suppliers play an important role, while this is not the case with universities.}

We analyze multiple case studies of blockchain projects implemented in supply chains in developing countries to assess product quality, environmental accounting and social impact measurement. We have developed seven propositions, which describe how blockchain can help address a number of challenges various stakeholders face in promoting sustainable supply chains in developing countries. The challenges that the propositions deal with include those associated with an unfavorable institutional environment, high costs, technological limitations, unequal power distribution among supply chain partners and porosity and opacity of value delivery networks.}

We identify several ways by which the digital transformation may provide a context favourable to autistic workers. This includes creating new opportunities, valuing their performative abilities, cognitive differences and creativity, removing stereotypes and biases during the recruitment and improving the management of psycho-social risks. Neurodiversity management also contributes to the digital transformation by closing the digital skills shortage, shaping algorithms of artificial intelligence and providing a competitive advantage for innovation. Most importantly, neurodiversity management provides an effective model of inclusion that can mitigate the development of inequalities associated with the digital transformation.}

However, existing studies have neglected to explore the evolutionary and development of cross-boundary innovation models from a process perspective. In particular, the induction and summary of the enterprise digital cross-boundary innovation path will provide guidance for the innovation and development of SEMs, which has become the core problem to be solved in this study. This study embeds dynamic capabilities into the evolution process of enterprise ecological niche. Through a qualitative study on the three cross-boundary processes of the digital publishing projects of traditional publishing enterprises under the background of digital transformation, it reveals the growth mechanism and evolution path of dynamic capability affecting enterprise niche change in the process of cross-boundary innovation of SMEs. The results show that:(1) Under the background of digital transformation, the niche structure of SMEs is influenced by technology factor, resource factor, demand factor, and network factor; (2) In the process of cross-boundary innovation, the coupling of enterprise multi-dimensional dynamic capability and niche factors drive the migration of enterprise niche; (3) The development path of cross-boundary innovation of SMEs is the process of niche dynamic adjustment, such as niche expansion, niche dislocation and niche construction. This research conclusion reveals the development law of cross-boundary innovation of SMEs, further enriches the research system of cross-boundary innovation and provides theoretical guidance for the digital transformation of SMEs and the implementation of cross-boundary development strategy.}

We specifically investigate how changes in social overload and information overload over time act as stimuli, resulting in dissatisfaction as a negative personal state, which in turn leads to the restricted use of social media. We employ a mixed-methods approach to examine this phenomenon. First, we conduct a quantitative study using a three-wave survey of 664 domestic Chinese social media users. Both social overload change and information overload change contribute to user dissatisfaction, consequently influencing restricted use behavior. Moreover, prominence negatively moderates the relationship between social overload change and dissatisfaction but does not affect the relationship between information overload change and dissatisfaction. Second, we triangulate these findings through in-depth interviews with 26 experienced social media users. The qualitative inputs from Study 2 help explain both the supported and unsupported hypotheses in Study 1. Our study offers new insights into the dynamic processes underlying restricted usage behavior within the context of social media.}

The research contributes to the limited literature on the internationalization of Chinese service firms. While largely affirming the literature on internationalization, the multiple case study approach adopted provides rich granular insights into the distinctive motives, strategies and challenges that Chinese Internet firms can face in the European market. It identifies particular nuances that are easily missed in studies based on secondary data. In particular, two clearly distinct processes of internationalization in Europe emerge. While existing work on the internationalization of Chinese Internet firms has mostly regarded them as a cohesive and homogeneous set of companies, our findings suggest that we are dealing with two different sets of companies whose approaches toward internationalization seem to be radically different, revealing two tales of internationalization. From the findings it emerges that differently from the Internet firms that started to internationalize earlier as part of a “first wave” of internationalization, the firms that started to internationalize later as a part of a “second wave” have done so, with a significant speedier pace by also adopting a bolder internationalization strategy that shares some common features with the first movers but that also displays a remarkably higher level of sophistication. Significantly, this type of firm does not seem to suffer from any liability of any kind.}

It assesses if CBDC policy should be guided by consumer data. The evaluation covers consumer willingness to pay (WTP), the influence of individual CBDC perceptions, mediation of social advantages and infrastructure views, and the role of consumer attributes. Data from 1308 Chinese respondents were collected via an online survey. A structural equation model examines WTP for China's CBDC (DCEP). Findings reveal significant WTP for DCEP, with noteworthy causal, mediation, and moderation effects. Positive individual perceptions enhance WTP, and consumer traits shape these relationships. Notably, perceiving individual CBDC benefits impacts WTP positively, while perceiving drawbacks dampens it. Consumers valuing CBDC's social advantages are more likely to adopt it, but this doesn't apply to infrastructure perceptions. Various consumer attributes moderate these dynamics, emphasizing the importance of consumer data in shaping CBDC strategies. Policy suggestions include tailored advertising, privacy measures, regulations, and usage strategies to ensure CBDC sustainability.}

Therefore, novel technologies such as fog computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) can provide a flexible and real-time platform to meet the data-driven requirements of the current agricultural decision-makers. Smart agriculture is a new idea since IoT sensors and fog platforms can provide information about agriculture and then operate on them based on user feedback. Also, with the rapid growth of IoT, the importance of recommender systems is increased in this domain. Therefore, the main goals of this study are to improve the accuracy of agricultural service recommendations and decrease the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in the IoT-based fog systems using collaborative filtering and artificial Artificial Bee Colony (ABC). However, many of the current methods suffer from low accuracy of recommendations of the agricultural services. The present article suggested a collaborative filtering-based approach based on the ABC and genetic operators to design an effective recommender scheme in fog-based IoT systems. The results showed that the accuracy and MAE are optimized compared to some state-of-the-art methods. They also revealed that compared to other methods, the proposed method improves ranking score by 5.8 %, precision by 5%, recall by 5.7%, intra similarity by 13%, and hamming distance by 4.8%.}

To fill the gap of profiling collaborative content and to inspire related studies, this paper provides a bibliometric-enhanced method of mapping topic networks and measuring the semantic structures of academic-industrial collaboration. Via this method, topics can be extracted, vectorized, and correlated to construct a bibliometric-enhanced topic network as a representation of the collaborative content generated by these partnerships. Examining the structural properties of the topic network can provide comprehensive insights for future academic-industrial research collaborations. To showcase these insights, we conducted a case study involving both articles and patents in the field of digitalization.

The theoretical analysis shows that digital agriculture influences urbanization in four ways, namely the total factor productivity enhancement mechanism, the agricultural labor division acceleration mechanism, the marketization process mechanism, and the human capital mechanism. The empirical test suggests that digital agriculture has significantly promoted urbanization across the sample period, and the effect has shown certain stability, sustainability, and durability. According to the contribution decomposition of digital agriculture sub-indexes, the quality of agricultural operational entities contributes the most to urbanization, followed by digital agricultural infrastructure. However, contrary to expectations, digital agriculture industrialization as measured by “Taobao Village” has the least impact on urbanization. Further mechanism tests indicate that digital agriculture promotes urbanization through the agricultural labor division acceleration mechanism, which is consistent with the theoretical expectation, suggesting that it is the driving force for urbanization. However, the performances of digital agriculture in the human capital mechanism, total factor productivity enhancement mechanism, and marketization process mechanism are inconsistent with the theoretical expectations, which are the main reasons for restricting the role of digital agriculture in promoting urbanization.}

Through screening credit rating indexes, we established a credit scoring model of the borrower. In addition, we constructed formulas to determine the probability of default and default loss rate. The model also classifies the credit qualities of borrowers. In addition, we designed a selection algorithm for the borrower's credit quality rating index, and a borrower's credit quality rating algorithm. This paper collects sample data of 7706 borrowers of Renren loans from the Internet. The credit scores of the borrower, the default probability, and the default loss rate of each type of borrower are calculated, and the repayment status of borrowers are analyzed. We divided the borrowers into 7 grades and 5 grades by calculating a confusion matrix. The experimental results show that the overall accuracy of the credit scoring model is 98.5%, in which the accuracy for non-default samples is 98.9%, and the accuracy for default samples is 88.3%. The accuracy of the established credit quality rating model proved to be relatively high, and it can provide important reference values and scientific guidance for banks, financial institutions, and major financial platforms.

Through a meta-analytic study, we explored consumer behavior in SC, compared different theoretical frameworks, tested the moderators among variables, and tested the effect of the factors derived from consumer behavior theory on the stages of consumer decision-making. We found the variables from TAM, TRA/TPB, UTAUT, and the IS Success model to be important in motivating consumer behavior. Furthermore, we found the variables from the IS Success model to be less strongly correlated with SC behavior than the variables from other theories. In contrast, the variables from UTAUT are more strongly correlated with SC behavior. We found interpersonal trust to be more strongly correlated with SC behavior (r+=0.497) compared with organizational trust (r+=0.411). More importantly, we found the difference to be statistically significant (Z=-3.838). This study makes theoretical contributions through a moderator analysis, which helps to better understand the underlying consumer behavior theories, and further examines the role of trust in the integration of such theories. The study also makes contributions to practice by informing SC platform providers on how their consumers behave during the stages of the purchase decision-making process.}

How to use the new generation of digital technology to achieve high-quality development of China's export trade has become the key to promoting the new development pattern of dual circulation at home and abroad. Based on the export technical complexity of 30 provinces in China from 2012 to 2020, this paper uses entropy weight TOPSIS to measure the development level of provincial digital economy, and deeply analyzes the impact and internal mechanism of digital economy on China's export technical complexity. The study found that the digital economy has significantly promoted the upgrading of China's export technology, and this improvement effect is most obvious in the eastern region. But the export quality of the western region has a negative inhibitory effect. From the perspective of the impact mechanism, the digital economy can achieve export technology upgrading by promoting knowledge spillover and accelerating the marketization process. From the perspective of industrial transformation and upgrading, the development of the digital economy accelerates the technological upgrading of export products through the upgrading of industrial structure, but it has no obvious impact on the rationalization of industrial structure. Further tests show that the effect of digital economy on the upgrading of export product quality is more prominent in low-tech industries. The conclusions of this paper provide data support and analysis perspective for exploring the innovative development of trade led by digital economy and enhancing the international competitiveness of China's foreign trade. It provides new ideas for improving the quality of China's high-quality external circulation development under the background of digital economy, and provides policy reference for the organic combination of digital economy development strategy and foreign power strategy.}

We report on an in-depth longitudinal case study of a solution provider and other actors in an ecosystem. We contribute by drawing on activity theory to explain the development of autonomous solutions as epistemic objects. Although digital solutions suggest the compression of time and space, we find instead that spatial-temporal expansion helps us understand the development and co-evolution of business ecosystems, which we describe as being in a state of flux, akin to the movement of an amoeba. Furthermore, we explain how epistemic objects, mediated by using tools, enable the move toward autonomous solutions that create value. In so doing, we argue that ‘autonomous’ solutions are never completely autonomous in the sense that they can exist on their own as objects; they require many other mediating tools to bring them into existence and through which they evolve. Lastly, our findings provide valuable insights into how practitioners may develop advanced digital solutions in their ecosystem to expand expertise networks and foster closer collaboration.}

The proposed model is validated using the partial least squares method. Results show that perceived coupon value (PCV) and situational product involvement (SPI) positively influence redeeming and sharing intentions. In addition, PCV is positively affected by economic benefit, perception of others, informativeness of ratings and reviews, and vividness of reviews, whereas SPI is positively affected by economic benefit, social presence of web, informativeness of ratings and reviews, and vividness of reviews.

The analysis of desirability indicates that focusing on small businesses is key to successfully integrating the social mission; feasibility analysis reveals that accurate application of soft information and resource integration is essential for gaining competitive advantage; and analysis of viability shows that enhanced risk management and scaling up operations are crucial for achieving operational performance. Through data analysis of the case banks from 2012 to 2021, this study provides evidence that microcredit institutions can achieve dual objectives and offers insights into how they do so. This provides valuable lessons for enhancing financial inclusiveness and expanding the coverage of commercial banks.}

This paper aims to contribute to the ongoing debate on the factors that affect access to finance and profitability of academic spinoffs across different stages of spinoff growth. We distinguish and define an intrapreneurial academic spinoff to argue that the intrapreneur's own development of digital technology, stage of growth, and the field of science represent three boundary conditions to access external finance and gain profitability. Using the data from 89 intrapreneurial academic spinoffs in natural sciences, such as physical sciences and astrophysics, mathematics, chemical sciences, earth and related environmental sciences as well as 660 spinoffs from other fields of science in the United Kingdom over 2015–2019, this paper examined the role of spinoff growth stage and development of digital technologies in access to finance and profitability of this type of spinoffs. The paper offers implications for policymakers, intrapreneurial spinoffs, and university managers.}

The findings are substantiated through the application of the approach in an omni-channel retail supply chain. The combination of clustering and neural networks improved demand forecast, supporting an assertive identification of demand volume and location. Simulation-based optimization allowed for the definition of which facility would serve identified demands most effectively. The approach reduced fulfillment lead time, mitigated backorders arising from incompatible product´s supply and demand, and lowered operational costs, which are key performance indicators in today’s competitive retail markets.}

We conducted a qualitative multiple-case study in Scandinavian organisations offering HR services. Grounded theory guided our data collection and analysis. Input-Process-Output framework and affordance theory supported the analysis of specific information processing constraints and enablers. We developed a framework to explain how AI affordances enable digital innovation and address the calls about definitional boundaries between innovation processes and outcomes. We showed how AI affordances are actualised and how this leads to reontologising decision-making and providing data driven legitimisation. Our study contributes to digital innovation research by elucidating AI affordances and their actualisation in organisations. We conclude with the implications to theory and practice, limitations, and suggestions for future research.}

Furthermore, these innovations are based on an ecosystem involving a diversity of actors operating along the supply chain who need to explore new knowledge to understand, test and evaluate their potential. Such exploration needs are studied in detail on the basis of interdisciplinary research. The case studied here reflects innovation “in the making”. Several development scenarios are possible, leading to a more or less pronounced redistribution of the roles of the actors in innovation. Beyond the actors’ exploration needs, we show that current market regulations and standards can constitute obstacles to exploration. Thus, the development of such systemic innovations requires both an exploration of new knowledge by the actors of the sector and an evolution of market standards.}

The results show that the adaptive change in EEEs is a dynamic process. The negative impact of international business environment challenges on enterprise development is the starting point for enterprises to adopt change behaviors. Through adaptive change in innovation strategy, innovation architecture and innovation systems, EEEs can break through technology blockades, overcome market crises and further weaken the negative impact of such challenges. This study constructs an adaptive change process model for EEEs and proposes strategic initiatives for EEEs with the help of a national innovation system (NIS), which has policy implications for EEE strategies and industrial policy design in emerging economies.}

The proposed agile co-creation model provides insight into the phases, activities, and organizational principles of a micro-service innovation approach. Relational teams that pool knowledge from providers’ and customers’ strategic, technological, and operational areas are crucial to ensure successful cooperation and governance for agile co-creation.

The optimal pricing decisions of suppliers are characterized and possible coalition structures are proposed. Results document that coalition structures, product demand characteristics, and manufacturing costs profoundly impact optimal wholesale price decisions. In addition, component suppliers are not always worse off even when the remaining suppliers form a partial coalition. Conditions under which all suppliers form a grand coalition are also provided to introduce a fair allocation and a non-empty core. A numerical experiment is conducted to show the influence of model parameters on the profit of different coalition structures. Profit allocation between the suppliers under the multiproduct assembly system is also discussed.}

In this paper, we describe how data science, which combines computer programming, domain knowledge, and analytic skillsets to scientifically extract insights from data, can be used to help meet the growing demand of analytic needs across an organization’s value chain. This is done through the illustration of an applied data science initiative to a strategic sourcing problem via the use of open-source technology. In doing so, we contribute to the growing data science literature by demonstrating the application of unique data science capabilities.

To fill this gap, based on an integrated perspective of dynamic capability and organizational inertia, this study examines the curvilinear relationships between digital transformation and economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable performance. Survey data from 223 Chinese companies articulate that although digital transformation fosters economic performance at an accelerating rate, it depicts an inverse U-shaped relationship with environmental performance. More interestingly, the accelerating rate of digital transformation on economic performance is quicker under low market turbulence. In contrast, when market turbulence is high, higher digital transformation is associated with worse environmental performance. This study contributes to the literature by providing new theoretical explanations for the inconsistent relationship between digital transformation and sustainable performance. This study also assists companies in re-evaluating their digital strategies.}

To facilitate start-ups in financial markets, several regulatory authorities have adopted a new incubation model called a ‘regulatory sandbox’. Regulatory sandboxes enable eligible applicants to test their technology-enabled financial solutions for a certain period of time (subject to conditions the regulator imposes). As such, these instruments allow innovation while preventing severe instability in financial markets caused by systemic risk. Despite their importance, management research has devoted little attention to studying how sandboxes operate as a new incubation model. In our abductive study, we adopt the activity system framework and a qualitative analysis approach to investigate the activities of five leading sandboxes and compare them with the activities of other incubation models. The data analysis yielded an activity model with three design elements (achieving membership, participating and detaching) and one design theme (improving connectedness). Thus, sandboxes are characterized by providing regulatory guidance and facilitating access to testing across international jurisdictions, distinguishing them from both generic and specialized incubation models. Our primary contribution to the incubation literature is extending the knowledge of a unique incubation model through a set of theoretical propositions.}

While researchers have identified various drivers of radical innovation within firms, they often overlook the significant role that heterogeneous resources in network alliances play. This study addresses this gap by examining industry association embeddedness through the lens of social networking. Focusing on China's listed pharmaceutical manufacturing companies from Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share markets between 2007 and 2021, we find a positive relationship between industry-association embeddedness and radical innovation. Our findings indicate that this positive effect is significantly enhanced by firms' absorptive capacity. Moreover, increased digital investment further strengthens the effect of absorptive capacity on the relationship between industry-association embeddedness and radical innovation. This study offers theoretical insights into the role of intermediary bodies, such as industry associations, in fostering radical innovation.

However, this field's conceptual evolution is posited to be in its infancy in other sectors, such as for managing luxury goods and counterfeit products. Further, the thematic classification of the extant literature led to the identification of the following four major themes of research: strategy and regulation, enablement and implication, multi-domain deployment, and the inefficiencies of bitcoin.

abstract = {Demand forecasting is important information for all enterprises. Accurate forecast information determines the success of supply chain operations. This paper studies the selection strategy of e-commerce sales mode and information sharing strategy in a dual-channel supply chain. The manufacturer and e-retailer enter a Stackelberg competition. The e-retailer independently decides to share or not share forecasting demand information to the manufacturer. The results show that only if the investment efficiency of the manufacturer’s after-sales service is high, e-retailer is willing to share demand forecasting information. Information sharing does not always add value to the e-retailer, which may lead to the ‘precision trap’ of the e-retailer. Moreover, forecasting accuracy always has a positive impact on the e-retailer’s profit. However, the manufacturer would benefit from more accurate forecasting demand in the case of sharing information. Otherwise, prediction accuracy is negatively correlated with the manufacturer’s profit. Besides, the selection strategy of e-commerce sales mode depends on the level of the manufacturer’s investment efficiency. Specifically, if the manufacturer invests in after-sales service more efficiently, platform sales mode is preferred. If not, they prefer wholesale sales mode.}

Considering the enhanced uncertainty in the lifecycle of a digital startup and their high failure rates compared to non-digital startups, access to VC financing is a crucial element that influences their survival and scale-up. Leveraging signaling theory in unique ways and using a two-stage financing model, we analyze a sample of 124 digital startups in India and find that during the selection stage, the founders' perception of VCs' ability to contribute non-financial value-added services influences their decision to seek VC financing. But at the decision stage, signals emanating from younger stage entrepreneurs with an education pedigree from premier institutes, startups that are incubated in an incubator or are part of an accelerator program, or those building businesses focusing on digitally enabled business models, are likely to be valued highly by VCs and therefore have a higher likelihood of receiving VC financing. Yet much remains to be done by the policy makers in India for those who do not fall within this spectrum to stimulate the growth of digital startups in the country.}

This approach makes it possible for the proposed methods to be dynamic enough to deal with the data's volatility, complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity. It is demonstrated that incorporating TVF-EMD to provide time-frequency analysis along DE-RVFL, and goal-oriented social media analytics boosts the performance of out-of-sample predictions statistically and compensates for the "warranty data maturation" effect. The proposed algorithm's Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) decreases by 23.37%-88.76% relative to other benchmark cutting-edge models. This study contributes significantly to the services management community. Using the proposed methodology, managers could create plans for warranty claims strategies that reduce inventory levels and waste while optimizing customer satisfaction, advocacy, and revenues. These merits provide incentives and support for policymakers to adopt advanced technologies, such as the ones developed and implemented in the current study, in warranty claims forecasting to improve accuracy and efficiency.}

Our results indicate that: First, the satisfiers of TP dimensions were felt more by users who are ready to accept new technologies. Second, users with a lower degree of personal TR experienced more negative paradoxical attitudes and less positive outlooks.

Customer delight and place attachment are modelled as mediators between satisfaction and loyalty. The results show that each transaction-specific satisfaction is significantly related to customer delight and place attachment with the exception that a positive experience with casino gaming is not related to place attachment. Whilst place attachment has a significant influence on customer loyalty, customer delight has little effect on the loyalty indicators. The study provides a fresh perspective on the customer satisfaction-loyalty relationship. The implications of these findings are highlighted for researchers and practitioners.}

Therefore, this study implemented a streamlined evaluation text mining method that employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-based modeling for robust content analysis. Over the past 19 years (2004–2022), there has been a significant increase in the number of journal articles that center on AM in supply chains. Through an extensive analysis of 341 published papers, five main research themes were identified: manufacturing, environment, costs, logistics, and maintenance. The identification of a gap in research in regional locations is significant as they often face unique challenges in their supply chains, such as limited access to technology and required infrastructure and the availability of resources. These challenges may have a different impact on the implementation of AM. Further, the possible impact of using AM in the recovery of RSCs after the COVID-19 pandemic is substantial and can bring about several positive sustainable changes, including increased responsiveness to changing demands, shorter production lead times, lower material usage and waste, customizability, localized production, energy efficiency, and reduced carbon dioxide and gas emissions.}

Data from 221SMEs is analyzed through the fsQCA to explore the complex interactions between digital technology, organization, environment and the initial and deepening stages of Chinese SMEs' digital transformation. Three key findings are revealed. Firstly, to effectively promote the initiation speed and implementation depth of SMEs' digital transformation, a collaborative effort is required by entrepreneurs, digital service companies, customers, and government. Secondly, external factors have a significant promoting effect on both the initial and deepening stage of SMEs' digital transformation. Of particular note is the usability of digital technology, which is indicated to be a crucial factor for both the initial and integration stage. This indicates that SMEs exhibit a heightened sensitivity to the complexity and future uncertainty of digital technologies. Thirdly, by promoting the digitalization of industrial clusters, the deepening stage can be facilitated effectively by governments.}

Internationalization, digitalization, and sustainability are three key growth paths for firms. In particular, the contemporary economy stresses the relevance of digital transformation as a central driver towards innovation and business renewal, especially for established small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). However, little is known about the relationships among the above-mentioned growth paths, whether they are competing or complementary options. Our contribution addresses this gap focusing on two forms of organizational readiness within SMEs. First, it investigates the impact of Artificial Intelligence readiness on international performance. Second, it explores whether the relationship between digitalization and internationalization is affected by sustainability readiness. The empirical survey relies on a sample consisting of 438 SMEs, including both domestic and international companies. Findings confirm, as expected, that Artificial Intelligence readiness positively influences the international performance of SMEs. Moreover, we find that digitalization and sustainability are positively related, but they turn to be competing growth paths when the firm internationalizes..}

Based on our analysis, we theorize that the COVID-19 crisis has led to three types of dynamics (temporal, structural, and spatial) that contribute to GVC restructuring. Consistent with the paradox approach, we document two counter-tensions that influence the GVC in the long term: the push to disintegrate (i.e., permanently restructure) and the pull to integrate (i.e., preserve or strengthen the existing structural routines). We conceptualize the ultimate structure of the GVC as the alignment of a new balance of power and new capabilities of the GVC actors. Implications for theory, practice, and policy are discussed.}

However, the role of intermediary organisations in changing sociotechnical systems and overcoming ecosystem limitations remains largely unexplored. This paper aims at addressing this research gap. Through extensive fieldwork, we explore the case of German competence centres created by the federal government for supporting the digitalisation of SMEs to provide a greater understanding of how intermediary organisations operate in the context of a sociotechnical transition. Specifically, we characterise the role of intermediary organisations in supporting innovation ecosystem participants in engaging with the sociotechnical changes underpinning the Industry 4.0 production system. We suggest the term systemic meta-intermediary for describing a network of intermediary organisations incorporating multiple and heterogeneous competences, with the ultimate goal of facilitating and shaping the transition of a complex sociotechnical system. Actionable insights into how intermediaries can accelerate sociotechnical transitions and extend the benefits generated within Industry 4.0 innovation ecosystems are offered.}

This study investigates customer satisfaction through aspect-level sentiment analysis and visual analytics. We collected and examined the flight reviews on TripAdvisor from January 2016 to August 2020 to gauge the impact of COVID-19 on passenger travel sentiment in several aspects. Till now, information systems, management, and tourism research have paid little attention to the use of deep learning and word embedding techniques, such as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, especially for aspect-level sentiment analysis. This paper aims to identify perceived aspect-based sentiments and predict unrated sentiments for various categories to address this research gap. Ultimately, this study complements existing sentiment analysis methods and extends the use of data-driven and visual analytics approaches to better understand customer satisfaction in the airline industry and within the context of the COVID-19. Our proposed method outperforms baseline comparisons and therefore contributes to the theoretical and managerial literature.}

However, statistical models usually presume some data generation process while making strong assumptions about the errors. In this paper, we present a novel data-centric approach — ‘forecasting with cross-similarity’, which tackles model uncertainty in a model-free manner. Existing similarity-based methods focus on identifying similar patterns within the series, i.e., ‘self-similarity’. In contrast, we propose searching for similar patterns from a reference set, i.e., ‘cross-similarity’. Instead of extrapolating, the future paths of the similar series are aggregated to obtain the forecasts of the target series. Building on the cross-learning concept, our approach allows the application of similarity-based forecasting on series with limited lengths. We evaluate the approach using a rich collection of real data and show that it yields competitive accuracy in both points forecasts and prediction intervals.}

abstract = {Demand fluctuations, price of products and customer’s preferences play an important role in distribution and retail systems. In this paper, the issue of competitive pricing is investigated in a distribution system considering customers’ behavior. The distribution system includes two wholesalers and two retailers with asymmetric power in the market. A new bi-level model is proposed to demonstrate the Stackelberg competition among the main entities in distribution systems (wholesalers and retailers). Moreover, the horizontal competition is examined among the retailers and wholesalers, individually. The horizontal competition among retailers is investigated on retail price and retailers’ location using Behavior-Based Price Discrimination (BBPD). On the other hand, the competition among wholesalers is modeled on wholesale price and service level. The proposed model concentrates on profit maximization objective for the entities and utility maximization for the customers through behavior-based price discrimination. The model is carried on an industrial case problem for sensitivity analysis and comparison of different scenarios to derive managerial insights.}

Theorizing from the Dynamic Capability (DC) perspective, we develop a model to investigate how different BA (descriptive, predictive, prescriptive) influence innovative ambidexterity (exploration and exploitation) and competitive advantage. Besides, we propose the construct of “BA strategy” (innovator, conservative, undefined) to differentiate between firms in the way they adopt, use, and implement BA. Based on the PLS analysis of the 181 firm-level survey data, we assess the proposed model. The results show that innovative ambidexterity fully mediates the BA – competitive advantage relationship. We also find that BA innovator and conservative strategy moderate the BA-exploration and BA-exploitation links while such moderation is not observed for BA undefined strategy. This study enriches BA literature in various ways. First, it extends our understanding of the link from different BA categories to innovative ambidexterity, explorative innovation, and exploitative innovation. Second, this study provides empirical support of how BA strategy moderates BA – innovative ambidexterity – competitive advantage relationship and shows that to what degree BA innovator strategy leads firms to greater competitive advantage than BA conservative strategy.}

For this reason, drawing on the signal theory (i.e., combining project cultural background, peer review valence, and face information disclosure), we develop an econometric model to examine the success determinants of cultural and creative crowdfunding (CCCF) projects. A data set with 2877 real CCCF projects obtained from Modian.com is used for analysis. The Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach is used to calculate the sentiment and information entropy of reviews in crowdfunding projects, and an open-source image processing library is used to identify face information. Moreover, an instrumental variable is considered to address endogeneity problems. The empirical results show that cultural background and peer review valence in CCCF projects positively influence crowdfunding success, while initiators' real face information disclosure negatively influences crowdfunding success. Furthermore, the information entropy of peer reviews negatively moderates the influence of peer review valence on crowdfunding success. This research provides a new perspective, i.e., latent features in CCCF, to explore success determinants. In addition, this study contributes to guiding the CCCF platforms in developing appropriate strategies and helps to improve the initiator's chances of successful fundraising.}

Moreover, leader–follower EI (in)congruence indirectly affects the followers’ team identification via the mediating role of LMXRS.

This study aims to identify the role of information management (IM) and knowledge management (KM) in shaping performance in entrepreneurial firms. Moreover, the study aims to examine the causal relationship between IM and KM. Our sample consisted of 150 small and medium-sized firms that manufacture furniture in Poland. This is a mix-method study; it uses structural equitation modeling (SEM), fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), and interview-based qualitative analysis to examine the associations among entrepreneurial orientation (EO), IM, KM, and firm performance. In particular, three types of outcomes are analyzed; namely, firm competitiveness (FC), firm growth (FG), and financial performance (FP). The results unveiled the impact of IM on KM; the findings also showed the positive role of EO in shaping IM and KM as well as firm performance. In general, IM and KM impact firm performance; however, their individual impacts depend on the performance type (when they interact, they constitute a sufficient condition for achieving a high level of performance regardless of the type). These findings contribute to the IM and KM literature as well as entrepreneurship and small business research.}

As a result, the study of e-commerce channel configuration decision has become an important research topic. Toward this end, we establish three-stage sequential game models and investigate a manufacturer’s electronic channel configuration strategy from the perspective of both the manufacturer and the whole supply chain. In addition to a traditional channel, the main innovation of this paper is the framework involving three different electronic channel structures: the first is direct selling, in which the manufacturer sells products directly to consumers; the second is agent selling, in which the manufacturer sells products through a third-party platform; and the third is dual-format selling, in which the manufacturer sells products through both direct selling and agent selling. In these frameworks, the manufacturer’s selling price and the platform’s transaction fee are obtained by backward induction. Another innovation is the simultaneous incorporation of key factors such as the cross-channel effect, channel competition and platform service into our discussion. Sensitivity analysis is carried out and numerical examples are given to reveal the impact of exogenous parameters on equilibrium outcomes and channel configuration strategies both theoretically and numerically. Our analysis shows that channel competition intensity and transaction fee impact factor are critical to determining channel configuration. When these two factors are both either large or small, dual-format selling is the optimal configuration; otherwise, agent selling is preferred. In addition, we find that an electronic channel consisting solely of direct selling will never be chosen. In the extended models, we also find that our main results are robust for cases of positive entry cost, endogenous pricing, and demand-driven data value.}

However, in this process, manufacturing enterprises face many challenges such as multi-stage test data and heterogeneous information sources, large errors in product demand prediction, and uncertainty in maintenance thresholds and maintenance sequences. To address these challenges, a data-driven value chain integration approach is proposed in this paper to build a digital value chain ecosystem for enterprises. In the product design phase, a Bayesian assessment technique is introduced to integrate information from multiple sources. In the product sales phase, a two-stage sales prediction method is proposed. A planning model with variance maximization, correlation minimization, and estimation error minimization as decision objectives is introduced for weight search with ensemble learning. In the after-sales stage of the product, a cost-optimized dynamic maintenance strategy with a maintenance threshold as a constraint is constructed using the number of maintenance and the maintenance interval as decision variables. In addition, cost-based maintenance prioritization is included. Finally, the applicability of the proposed method is verified by the production data of a real manufacturing enterprise. Our findings suggest that the proposed approach helps manufacturing enterprises to aggregate, co-create, and upgrade their value chains. At the same time, manufacturing enterprises should actively build digital value chain ecosystems and dynamically adjust their maintenance strategies according to the production process and life cycle of their products to obtain the best economic benefits.}

This study proposes and empirically examines an extended model covering all aspects that would shape the successful adoption of AI by decision-makers while investigating how the successful adoption of AI enhances the efficiency of the decision-making process. This study also intends to test the validity of the integrated AI acceptance-avoidance model (IAAAM) proposed by Cao et al. (2021) using the Middle East context (i.e. Saudi Arabia). The extended model of the current study was based on the IAAAM and IS professional distinctiveness (ISPD). Two quantitative studies were conducted to achieve the research objectives. The first study was conducted to validate the IAAAM using a purposive sample of employees (non-adopters of AI applications). The second study tested the proposed model using a purposive sample of employees (actual adopters). The structural equation modelling (SEM) results of the first study (non-adopters) supported the validity of the IAAAM in Saudi Arabia. Factors (performance expectancy (PE), facilitating conditions (FC), personal well-being concern (PWC), perceived threat (PT), and attitudes (ATT)) had a significant impact on either ATT or the intention to use AI. The SEM results of actual adopters supported the impact of PE, EE, FC, PWC, and ATT on either ATT or the adoption of AI (AoAI). As an external factor, the ISPD was the most significant predictor of AoAI. The AoAI was confirmed to strongly predict decision-making efficiency, which, in turn, contributes to functional performance. This study enriches the current understanding of the main factors that contribute to the successful implementation of AI systems, offering an in-depth understanding of both AI adopters and non-adopters. It identifies factors important to non-users to enhance future adoption, whereas current AI users focus on improving decision-making quality with the AI assistance.}

With the value offered by BA, companies are able to discover the hidden information in the data, improve decision-making processes, and support strategic planning. On the other hand, because there are multiple criteria and multiple alternatives involved in most decision-making situations, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods play an important role in BA practices. Providing inputs to the components of descriptive or predictive analytics or being used as a decision-making tool for evaluating the alternatives within prescriptive analytics exemplify the roles. Therefore, the use of hidden information discovered by business analytics and the need for utilizing the right MCDM method for optimal decision-making made these two concepts inseparable. In this paper, in order to review the use of MCDM methods in BA, the subject of BA is investigated from a taxonomical perspective (descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive), and its connection with MCDM techniques is revealed. Similarly, MCDM methods are studied using two main categories, multi-attribute decision making (MADM) and multi-objective decision making (MODM) methods. Furthermore, tabular and graphical analyses are also performed within the proposed review methodology. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first attempt that holistically considers the use of MCDM methods in BA.}

By combining information from two datasets of 10,074 ERC grants (representing 8361 individual grantees) and 2186 PoC proposals, and using automated machine learning, we can identify the main predictors of the propensity to apply and to win. Doing so fills a void in the literature on likelihood to apply. The results reveal major differences between potential and actual beneficiaries, due to decisions about applying for a grant and evaluations of the proposals. The decision to apply is affected by the interaction between the characteristics of the PoC funding scheme, the ERC grantee, and his/her environment. Grantees in countries that invest little in innovation, with low cost of personnel, and strong collaboration in innovation are more likely to apply. Male grantees are more likely to apply but have similar chances of winning as women.}

However, price movements present more complex nonlinear behavior due to an increasingly diverse range of risk factors. To achieve better accuracy, this study explores a novel multiscale hybrid paradigm to estimate crude oil prices. The method takes advantage of the variational mode decomposition method to decompose the crude oil price into several simple models, which can be explained using regular factors, irregular factors and trends. Data characteristic analysis is conducted to identify the complexity of different components of the time series. It is important for a multiscale model to select an appropriate model to produce the optimal forecasts. Thus, the final forecasted values are generated by reconstituting all these forecasting items. By investigating the West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude oil prices, this paper presents how data characteristic identification and analysis are conducted in a multiscale paradigm. The empirical analysis proves that the proposed model can achieve superior forecasting results, which indicates the effectiveness of the multiscale model at forecasting complex time series, especially crude oil prices.}

We find three functions of knowledge intermediation that proactively contribute to socio-technical transitions: (i) information dissemination via events, (ii) knowledge exchange via network building, and (iii) implementation support via consulting. Thereby, we reveal an increasingly active role of knowledge intermediation in regional transitions. We identify additional roles concerning the identification and monitoring of new projects that emerge from the effects of digitalization on sustainability. We contribute to the current scholarly discussion about knowledge intermediation by complementing its’ contributions to innovation and regional development by proactive contributions to transition processes.}

Analysis and deep insights into the Australian life insurance market show the existence of adverse activities to gain financial benefits, resulting in loss to insurance companies.

However, policyholders’ behavior analysis is a complex process, usually involving several factors depending on their preferences and the nature of data such as data which is missing useful private information, the presence of asymmetric information of policyholders, the existence of anomalous information at the cell level rather than the data instance level and a lack of quantitative research.

In addition to the original data, we further created a synthetic AS dataset by randomly flipping the attribute values of 10% of the records in the test set. The experiment results on 31,800 Australian life insurance users show that the proposed approach achieves significant gains in performance comparatively.}

abstract = {“Collective Intelligence” has been a popular area of research for more than a decade. We apply two different analytical approaches (local and global bibliometric analysis) to describe how this literature is organized and how it has evolved. A local approach focuses on the 3,138 articles indexed in the Scopus database where ‘collective intelligence’ is in the title, abstract, or keyword. A global approach reclassifies all of the Scopus documents into research communities using all (1.28 billion) citations in the database and proceeds to identify which research communities are populated by the 3,138 Collective Intelligence (CI) articles. These two approaches provide significantly different perspectives on how CI is structured, who the leaders of the field are, and how it is evolving. A synthesis of these two perspectives provides ideas for those who wish to contribute to the collective intelligence field. Our findings support the Kuhnian idea of research communities as a useful concept in bibliometric analysis.}

abstract = {This study presents an in-depth analysis of the rapidly evolving mobile payment market, focusing on the competition between Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), as exemplified by China's Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP), and well-established private digital payment platforms. This research builds on economic theories, including Metcalfe's Law and the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). It employs the Stackelberg game model as a strategic framework to dissect these payment systems' interactions and potential equilibrium outcomes. A notable innovation of this study is the application of advanced simulation techniques, as it uses Matlab2018a to model and predict variations in profit margins contingent on the size of the user base for each payment method. This approach yields three insightful and nonintuitive results that deepen our understanding of market dynamics. First, the study underscores the indispensable role of government support, particularly in the nascent stages of DCEP implementation, as a catalyst for competitiveness against entrenched third-party systems. Without proactive and substantial backing from the government, the DCEP might struggle to gain a foothold in a market dominated by private entities. Second, this study highlights the critical interconnectedness among the various user groups. It posits that for DCEP to effectively penetrate the market and challenge the dominance of third-party platforms, it must strategically align itself within the existing networks of these platforms. This aspect emphasises the importance of understanding and leveraging the complex web of relationships and dependencies within the mobile payment ecosystem. Third, the study identifies mutually beneficial cooperative strategies between the DCEP and third-party platforms. Drawing on the concept of Nash equilibrium, this suggests that collaboration, rather than competition, could lead to optimal outcomes for both parties. This cooperative stance can manifest in various forms, such as shared technological infrastructure, joint ventures, and cross-platform compatibility, ultimately enhancing the value proposition for end users. These findings have significant implications for policymakers, financial regulators, and market strategists, as they suggest that a balanced approach that harmonises the strengths of state-led digital currencies and private payment solutions is crucial for the sustainable development of the digital finance sector. This study also provides strategic insights for CBDCs and private payment platforms, guiding them to make informed decisions in a market increasingly characterised by technological innovation, regulatory shifts, and evolving consumer preferences.}

Accordingly, the organization for digital manufacturing is completely disrupted, and the boundaries between users and producers are fading away, new functionalities are emerging, or existing ones are being re-modulated to deliver new unexpressed potential. Digital servitization impacts on the entire body of factors tied to manufacturing process; this paper seeks to simultaneously investigate the technological, social, and environmental levels. Unfortunately, the evolutionary trajectory of the manufacturing process seems to remain quite fuzzy and, most of all, the main factors responsible for the process changes are not clear. Our conceptual study aims to trace the evolutionary path of the manufacturing process based on four determinants: digital reconfiguration of the actors' organization, digital servitization strategy adoption, exaptation of the manufacturing process, and sustainable manufacturing mechanisms. Depending on the determinant level, our conceptual model sketches a process evolutionary trajectory by individuating different archetypes of a sustainable manufacturing process. This conceptual paper extends the previous literature that seems to miss a simultaneous analysis of what is the role of digital servitization in facing environmental changes by adopting a lens of analysis of exaptation which drives system modularity in relation to the sustainability goals and digital servitization potentials.}

Using a longitudinal case study, we track how China developed the world's largest mobile payments industry based on multiplatform ecosystems. Different from ecosystems mediated by a single multi-sided platform, multiplatform ecosystems provide mechanisms to realize complementarity between multiple platforms, sometimes across different industries, to co-create greater value than individual platforms can in isolation and to overcome barriers that stand in the way of mass scale-up. These barriers include: establishing an agreed market architecture; catalysing changes in user behaviour; and earning legitimacy in its socio-technical system. We show how the lead firms play an important role in overcoming these barriers to drive multiplatform ecosystem evolution, enabling the development of other businesses in the ecosystem, and promoting the accumulation of what we term ‘ecosystem goods’ that help the ecosystem create and capture value collectively. These findings enrich our theoretical understanding of the importance of complementary relationships and overcoming barriers to their formation in enabling multiplatform ecosystems to nurture the emergence and scale-up of a nascent industry. We also draw lessons for practising managers and policy implications.}

This study argues that these inconsistencies arise from the ambiguous nature of servitization. Prior research have operationalized servitization as a business model (service type) or a set of service capabilities, treating these distinct constructs interchangeably. This study, therefore, advanced the proposition that both service capabilities and service type need to be incorporated into an integrated framework. To test this, the research develops and empirically validates a moderated-mediation model for the relationship between digitalization, service type (moderator), service capabilities (mediator) and firm financial and market performance using data from 204 manufacturing firms. The results indicate that service capabilities positively mediate the relationship between digitalization and firm financial and market performance. The moderating effect of the service type on service capabilities and firm financial and market performance are more pronounced for services supporting customers than services supporting products. The findings underline the imperative for manufacturers to develop their digital capabilities to enhance their service capabilities, irrespective of the type of services they offered. The findings contribute by enriching our understanding of the relationship between servitization, digitalization and firm performance.}

Further research is needed to describe the nature and characteristics of the entrepreneurial ecosystem enabled by the new socio-technical paradigm. Based on extant literature, this article proposes a definition of digital entrepreneurship ecosystem by highlighting the integrated digital-output and digital-environment perspectives. A collective intelligence approach is then adopted to define a descriptive framework and identify the distinguishing genes of a digital entrepreneurship ecosystem. Four dimensions associated to digital actors (who), digital activities (what), digital motivations (why), and digital organization (how) are defined and discussed. The framework was also applied to describe 9 real cases of companies and initiatives, which are analyzed as digital entrepreneurship ecosystems along the four key dimensions presented.

The rising consumer environmental awareness (CEA) and transparency perception (CTP) of green product information have stimulated investments in blockchain technology and green production. However, the improved digital operation level resulting from blockchain technology investment further reduces carbon emissions. Considering these emerging features of DSC, the differential game is employed to investigate blockchain technology investment and green production investment strategies of DSC members from a long-run and dynamic standpoint. This study analyzes and compares DSC equilibrium strategies under four different scenarios. Theoretical results are verified through numerical experiments, and sensitivity analysis is conducted to unlock further insights. The results demonstrate that the digital operation level follows a monotonic trajectory, while the carbon reduction level exhibits no more than one change over time. In addition, CEA stimulates investment in green production and blockchain technology simultaneously. Both CEA and CTP improve the digital operation level, carbon reduction level and overall profit of the DSC. The improved synergic mechanism with bilateral participation is most effective in improving the economic efficiency and environmental benefit of the DSC. The economic advantage of the bilateral synergic mechanism over other mechanisms can be enhanced as CEA and CTP rise. The cost factor of blockchain technology investment and the manufacturer’s marginal benefit more significantly affect the demand and profit of green product. This study offers a solid theoretical foundation for the long-run operation and synergy of DSC in sustainable development.}

Unique corroboration entropy is calculated based on the number of words in this review that describe the product on the seller’s site, confirming the seller’s claims, which did not appear in previous reviews. Recommendation entropy is based on the number of words that are associated with explicit recommendations. Unique opinion, referred as “regular opinions” in the literature, entropy is based on the number of all the other words in the review that provide positive or negative evaluations of products as well as other additional informational elements that did not appear in previous reviews. The results show that both recommendation and unique opinion entropies (only marginally) increase review helpfulness evaluations, while greater unique corroboration entropy is insignificant.}

Findings reveal that applying blockchain can augment risk management by controlling opportunistic risk, the latter of which denotes the variability arising from opportunistic practices of internal agents or external parties afforded by their immediate socio-economic environment. Particularly, we not only identify credibility, predatory, and compliance risk as three distinct types of opportunistic risk stemming from the unique socio-economic environment of China, but we also illustrate how blockchain could be leveraged to deal with such opportunistic risks through trust-evoking mechanisms.

Therefore, an integrated decision-making framework called Pythagorean fuzzy-entropy-rank sum-Combined Compromise Solution (PF-entropy-RS-CoCoSo) is developed in this study, including two main phases. In the first phase, the PF-entropy-RS method is applied to obtain the subjective and objective weights of criteria to evaluate the technical challenges of transforming blockchain technology for a sustainable manufacturing paradigm in the Industry 4.0 era. The PF-CoCoSo model is then utilized in the second phase to assess the preferences of organizations over different technical challenges of the blockchain technology transformation for the sustainable manufacturing paradigm in the Industry 4.0 era. An empirical case study is taken to assess the main technical challenges of blockchain technology transformation for the sustainable manufacturing paradigm. Furthermore, a comparison analysis and a sensitivity investigation are made to demonstrate the superiority of the developed framework.}

abstract = {AI has received increased attention from the information systems (IS) research community in recent years. There is, however, a growing concern that research on AI could experience a lack of cumulative building of knowledge, which has overshadowed IS research previously. This study addresses this concern, by conducting a systematic literature review of AI research in IS between 2005 and 2020. The search strategy resulted in 1877 studies, of which 98 were identified as primary studies and a synthesise of key themes that are pertinent to this study is presented. In doing so, this study makes important contributions, namely (i) an identification of the current reported business value and contributions of AI, (ii) research and practical implications on the use of AI and (iii) opportunities for future AI research in the form of a research agenda.}

AI, digital data collection, and computer infrastructure advancements have empowered humans to address complex healthcare challenges. This study conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) of peer-reviewed journal articles at the intersection of AI, innovation, and healthcare to offer research directions for scholars and leaders in healthcare management. To achieve this, the systematic review identified and analyzed 378 published studies on AI innovation in healthcare. Evaluating these publications based on inclusion and exclusion criteria yielded 75 studies ultimately selected for comprehensive analysis. This research adds to the scope of previous investigations by aiming to 1) emphasize the most crucial AI-based healthcare applications, 2) explore challenges associated with AI integration in healthcare, and 3) examine student adoption and incorporation of AI into existing healthcare curricula. We also conducted an exploratory study of over 2700 AI-enabled healthcare startups worldwide to supplement our literature review. The SLR reveals several gaps within the research scope and proposes corresponding future research directions. These future research directions will assist researchers and enable healthcare professionals to develop legislation that accelerates the adoption of AI solutions in healthcare, ultimately enhancing public access to efficient and effective healthcare services.}

Digital twin in the food supply chain can enhance the resilience of food supply chain, reduce the food waste, and improve the sustainability. The purpose of this research is to identify and analyze the role of digital twin technology in enhancing the resilience and sustainability of food supply chain. The novel grey causal modelling (GCM) methodology has been utilized in this research for analysis. The GCM for the causal analysis can consider the four features that are characterized as the causes, the effects, the objectives, and the outcomes. This research work has identified the fifteen factors from the extant literature review and experts’ opinions. The responses are collected from the experts in two phases. In the first phase, responses were taken to find the cause-and-effect factors, and in second phase, responses were collected to rank the identified cause-effect pairs for various objectives to calculate the outcomes for the study. The various situations were plotted based on their outcomes with respect to objectives using the magnitude plots. Findings of the study suggest that enhanced coordination is the decisive causal factor, considering the dual objectives of resilience and sustainability. This research can be helpful for policymakers, practitioners, and food industries for the development of resilient sustainable FSC system.}

In addition, the robustness of the results is verified by numerical analysis. The results show that in order to make the total profit of decentralized decision-making equivalent to that of centralized decision-making, the recycling cost of retailers and third-party recyclers must be the same; new products must be shipped at zero profit, re-manufactured products shall be sold at the difference between the residual value of the recovered product and the cost of recovery, and the manufacturer's recycling price shall be determined by the cost of recycling and residual value. It implies that multi-channel recycling must be carried out under the premise of uniform recycling costs. At the same time as the elimination of the product price increase, the manufacturer's income must be guaranteed through agreements and other forms. The government can realize the recovery price in the direction of benefiting consumers by improving the residual value of used products and easing channel competition.}

PM aims to prevent and treat disease on the basis of a person's unique genetic makeup, lifestyle habits, and environment. While the topic has attracted huge attention from scholars in the biomedical field of research, in contrast, literature in the field of business studies is almost absent. This in itself is surprising: this revolution implies a profound impact on the business models of companies and institutions as it pushes a new paradigm of sustainable development for healthcare and welfare systems at the global level. However, little is known about whether, to what extent, and in what direction these dynamics are impacting on the way organisations and value chains are managed, from research to care delivery. Our study addresses this gap: we discuss both theoretical arguments and empirical evidence from a multiple case study survey. Findings show that PM is a multi-faceted phenomenon grounded on novel forms of innovation eco-systems and bundled-based models. We reveal a dramatic shift in the value chain, which is moving upstream from recovery and surgery to prevention and monitoring.}

However, while there are examples of emerging organizations using AI as a key basis of competitive advantage as well as examples of established organizations trialing AI technologies, there are relatively few examples of established organizations fundamentally transforming their business models through the use of AI. Through case studies underpinned by interviews with named executives of ten organizations and complemented by an applicability check involving 14 executives, advisors and practice-oriented academics, this paper presents an empirically supported set of factors linked to successful AI-enabled business model transformation as well as a model of interactions between these factors. Using a horizontal contrasting approach to articulate the difference between empirical findings and a literature based model, this paper moves from the language of potentially passive top management support towards the concept of proactive leadership and introduces tech-sensitive innovation culture, AI-sensitive risk tolerance and strategic process discipline into the dynamic capability lexicon. The insights of this paper can be used by managers to assess their readiness to move beyond traditional ‘proof-points’ and successfully undertake and accelerate AI-enabled business model transformation.}

Sustaining competitive advantage in this way, can put organizational leaders under pressure to ensure smart human resource management technology (SHRMT) is effectively used to drive the exchange of creative ideas in work teams. Though collective creative idea generation could increase task interdependence between teams, we argue that this does not sufficiently guarantee “willingness” to exert increased creative behaviour, especially under disruptive technological conditions. Our study employed a cross-sectional (time lag) survey design with 396 respondents from 56 manufacturing organisations in Nigeria. We utilised partial least squares path modelling for data analysis. We investigate how digital task interdependence, disruptive technology and SHRMT act to predict team creativity willingness. Our findings indicate that digital task interdependence, disruptive technology and SHRMT have direct positive effects on team creativity willingness, while disruptive technology attenuates SHRMT’s positive effect on team creativity willingness. Nevertheless, digital task interdependence dampens disruptive technology’s positive effect on team creativity willingness. Considering the volatility of today’s disruptive technology impacts, and by leveraging SHRMT and digital task interdependence tenets, practitioners may be able to better bolster team creativity willingness to sustain competitive advantage.}

Accordingly, users' lurking behavior in online communities deserves more attention and research. Our research explores the causes of social media users' lurking behavior through three constructs: refusal to disclose information, social browsing, and social network fatigue and the antecedents of these three constructs. Evidence from 786 valid questionnaire data indicates that the users lurk on social media platforms primarily out of a refusal to disclose information and social network fatigue rather than for social browsing. Notably, social network fatigue was the major contributor to the users' lurking behavior. In summary, our research enhances the understanding of the users' lurking behavior and its antecedent variables and reveals key lurking determinants that provide social media vendors with practical insight.}

Based on qualitative research using a longitudinal case study of China's digital infrastructure, three distinct collaborative green NPD phases including “innovation in peripheral components, incremental innovation in core components and radical innovation in core components” are identified. Besides, summaries of trust measures among suppliers, buying firms, and regulators are presented to open the black box of the antecedences and dynamics to facilitate the understanding of the truly complex nature of trust-building. During the phased collaborative green NPD processes, the role of China's national culture including “high degrees of power distance, low degrees of individualism, low degrees of uncertainty avoidance, high degrees of long-term orientation and high degrees of masculinity” is also discussed.}

The authors further develop these postulates by proposing the embedding of a growth characteristic identical to biological coupling. An empirical analysis focusing on the forefront endeavors of global bioeconomy firms and also by Amazon was conducted. A notable endeavor toward a circular economy initiated by its global leader UPM- Kymmene Corporation (UPM) demonstrated the significance of a coupling effect with downstream digital commerce leader Amazon. This effect can be attributed to harnessing the function of the growth characteristic identical to biological coupling through co-evolution of the dual coupling of bioeconomy and digitalization and of upstream and downstream operations. This co-evolutionary coupling is expected to provide a novel concept of R&D that grows its function in a self-propagating way during the R&D process. An insightful suggestion supporting to a novel concept of R&D in the digital economy is thus proposed.}

This study explores the antecedents of employees’ intention to accept robotics at workplace using two-step analyses: Twitter Analysis and Survey-based analysis. Around 121,750 tweets from 43,000 Twitter handles were evaluated in the form of descriptive analysis, geospatial analysis, network analysis and sentiment analysis. Thereafter, the conceptual model has been formulated and validated based on the extracted themes (anthropomorphism, technophobia and behavioral intention to accept robotics at workplace) by including 864 responses from an online survey conducted in India. The findings corroborated that anthropomorphism and technophobia significantly influence behavioral intention, and technophobia acts as a significant competitive mediator.}

Large-scale, hybrid frequency historical data for electricity usage and microcosmic behavior data have been integrated and analyzed. Empirical results show that monetary incentives have a significant effect on residents’ electricity saving behavior, which saved 0.116 kgwatt-hours (kWh), accounting for 12% of the total demand in peak-hour consumption. Moral suasion has a significant effect only for residents from high-income communities with a reduction in usage by 8.9%. Through matching survey data analysis, we found that families participating in DR save electricity through adjusting other major and small appliances rather than reducing the usage of air conditioners. Families with large number of major and small appliances response 0.51 kWh and 0.38 kWh more, respectively. Monetary incentive is indispensable in China's current stage of encouraging families’ reducing peak-hour electricity usage.}

However, as more stakeholders enter these markets, criminals are exploiting their inadvertent security deficiencies to launder illicit funds or finance terrorism. This three-round policy Delphi study involved consultations with 52 experts from different industries and countries to understand future risk-prone technological developments, possible prevention measures and relevant stakeholders. Results highlight a range of money laundering and terrorist financing risks being enabled by advances in distributed ledger technologies (predominantly through cryptocurrencies), new payment methods and financial technology (FinTech). These threats include privacy-enhanced cryptoassets, transaction laundering, e-currencies and digital-only financial services. Findings also suggest that detection-based countermeasures (currently the primary preventative approach) can be coupled with more diverse countermeasures to increase effectiveness. However, the unique circumstances and constraints specific to different stakeholders will affect the nature, utility, and extent to which they can implement certain countermeasures. As such, a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to prevention is undesirable. Drawing on expert insight from the study, we propose a framework and a 3-point standard of implementation to motivate cost-effective, user-friendly, and innovation-friendly measures to improve suspicious activity detection and futureproof technologies before their criminal exploitation becomes mainstream.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is predicted to radically transform the ways manufacturing firms create, deliver, and capture value. However, many manufacturers struggle to successfully assimilate AI capabilities into their business models and operations at scale. In this paper, we explore how manufacturing firms can develop AI capabilities and innovate their business models to scale AI in digital servitization. We present empirical insights from a case study of six leading manufacturers engaged in AI. The findings reveal three sets of critical AI capabilities: data pipeline, algorithm development, and AI democratization. To scale these capabilities, firms need to innovate their business models by focusing on agile customer co-creation, data-driven delivery operations, and scalable ecosystem integration. We combine these insights into a co-evolutionary framework for scaling AI through business model innovation underscoring the mechanisms and feedback loops. We offer insights into how manufacturers can scale AI, with important implications for management.}

This phenomenon has gained increasing attention in both academia and industry due to growing challenges to serve customers effectively. This study adopted a mixed-method approach to firstly conceptualize omnichannel customer experience and develop a survey instrument. Then, this study draws on the innovation diffusion theory to develop a nomological model that posits perceived compatibility and perceived risk as key linking mechanisms between omnichannel experience and omnichannel shopping intention. To achieve our research objective, we collected two data sets including pretest (n = 141) and model test (n = 377). We found that the constructs that represented our omnichannel experience conceptualization were good predictors of perceived compatibility and perceived risk, which further impact customers’ shopping intention. This study provides a rich conceptualization of an instrument for omnichannel customer experience that can serve as a springboard for future research to investigate the antecedents and impacts of omnichannel experience and can be used as a guide to design effective omnichannel retailing strategy.}

Interestingly, these relationships are more pronounced when senior executives have high behavioral engagement in online social media compared with those with low engagement. The major contribution of this study is to empirically verify the impact of the presence of social executives on corporate M&A outcomes through the lens of the upper echelons and social presence theories.}

This requirement poses a serious challenge: those classical dynamic indicators that have been proved to be effective in the literature may not be valid for commercial patent potential prediction from the ex-ante perspective. Thereupon, this study groups the dynamic indicators into cross-sectional indicators and longitudinal indicators. Then, a patent commercial potential prediction framework is proposed from the ex-ante perspective, in which the impact of the chronological order on predictive models is investigated comprehensively. More specifically, this study collects the USPTO cancer-related dataset from 2003 to 2013 as the training set, and combines three dynamic indicators (cross-sectional, longitudinal, and mixed) with classical static indicators to test the prediction performance for the following five years (2014–2018). The biased results caused by the ex-post perspective are indeed observed, and the longitudinal indicators are more sensitive to commercial patent potential, especially in the early stage. The effect of the ex-post perspective will gradually weaken over time, and the cross-sectional indicators provide stable prediction performance three years later. These findings will be helpful for subsequent improvements of commercial patent potential prediction models.}

By contrast, startups which have no venture capitalists on the board and whose board members are not on Twitter show an increased ability to translate assets into sales. Consistent with other research, our results indicate that startups potentially benefit from working with VCs because of the opportunity to access additional funding, although their presence does not necessarily translate into sales growth and operational efficiency.

Although digitalization shows great potential from a technological perspective, many process industry firms still face challenges in utilizing it for process innovations. Hence, this study aims to understand how process industry firms develop and implement new process innovations today and identify improvement opportunities through the better adoption and implementation of digitalization. The study adopted a multiple case study design in two steel manufacturing firms and developed a framework for building digitally-enabled process innovation using dynamic capabilities. The framework consists of 19 dynamic capabilities in total: 8 related to traditional process innovation and 11 related to digitally enabled process innovation. The study found four key challenges in process innovation (i.e., poor data strategy and readiness, lack of standardisation practices for change, competence and culture gaps, and ad-hoc problem solving) and four key enablers for digitally-enabled process innovation (i.e., infrastructure and methodological definition, preparation for predictive and analytical readiness, proactive management practices, and plan for a digital matureness for each function and department). The study's detailed empirical insights provide new understandings regarding required dynamic capabilities for the smoother transformation of a firm from the traditional process innovation to the digitally enabled process innovation. The dynamic capabilities are limitedly explored in the research of the process industries in the context of process innovation and digitalization. Thus, this study makes essential contributions to the theory of process innovation in process industries and strategic management by providing rich empirical insights from the steel sector.}

China has recently emerged as a key power of innovation with both increasing investment in research and clear improvements in research output. The main questions behind these facts are how this country makes such achievements in a short period of time and whether they are sustainable in the future. This paper proposes a new theoretical framework to explain the phenomenally accelerated technological catching-up process of China. Specifically, we set up an inverted S-curve model based on the existing theories. The empirical analyses herein provide clear evidence supporting the proposed theoretical framework. At the aggregate level, an empirical model is developed for the purpose of identifying the main driving forces of the technological progress of China. Based on the theoretical framework and the existing literature, a seven-variable model is used to investigate the contribution of key factors to the innovation outcome of China. At the micro-level, case studies on China General Nuclear (CGN), a leading state-owned nuclear energy company, as well as Huawei, a prominent Chinese private company in the telecommunications industry, provide further insights into what firm-level strategies, in combination with or leveraging state-level policies, enable successful stories in practice.}

A THC, which is a new incubation model, is a specialised organisation for establishing spin-offs as subsidiaries and commercialising university inventions. This study verifies the effects of THCs on the incubation productivity of universities by conducting a propensity-score matching and two-stage data envelopment analysis. The results show that, in the university group with high entrepreneurial orientation, universities with a THC are less productive in the invention stage but more productive in the commercialisation stage than universities without a THC. This demonstrates that THCs decrease productivity in the invention stage by playing the role of a gatekeeper but, in the commercialisation stage, increase productivity by playing the role of a sponsor. In addition, this study finds that the effects of a THC are more significant in universities with high entrepreneurial orientation than in universities with low entrepreneurial orientation. This paper shows that a THC positively affects university spin-offs crossing the VoD by playing different roles in the invention and commercialisation stages.}

We then analyze the external governance effects of blockchain applications, including the direct impact of blockchain applications on firms’ collaborative innovation, and the indirect impact of blockchain applications on the relationship between social trust and corporate collaborative innovation. We find that blockchain application enhances collaborative innovation and strengthens the positive impact of social trust on collaborative innovation. These results indicate that the application of blockchain technology improves the performances of firms’ collaborative innovation. It is therefore advisable for firms and governments to construct an ecosystem to facilitate the application of blockchain technologies.}

EAIA alludes to employee's concern about being replaced by artificial intelligence at work. Structural equations were used to test the research model. The key findings reveal that when EAIA is high, the negative impact of the NIHS is stronger. The finding is significant because it confirms that the NIHS, which is associated with organizational rejection of external technologies, is not a phenomenon exclusive to the pre-digital era, but its negative consequences such as biases in the digital technology assessment and neglect or suboptimal use of them, persist in the digital era. Nevertheless, the major contribution demonstrates that the NIHS is not an isolated fact or a product of individuals’ whims or irrationality; in the digital era, the NIHS is above all rational and opportunistic attitude rooted in EAIA. Furthermore, the NIHS becomes a planned response by employees aiming to minimize the risk of losing their jobs due to the impending replacement of digital technologies, particularly those related to automation processes.}

Non-linear relationships are common in analyzing adoption behaviors, but they are often ignored in the existing studies due to the limitations of conventional data analysis approaches. On the other hand, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are robust in dealing with non-linear relationships, but they lack interpretation capability, making ANNs unsuitable for RPV adoption analysis. To resolve the interpretation issue when considering non-linear relationships, this study proposes a six-step analytical procedure based on hybrid ANNs. The behavior theory was first integrated into the ANN to improve the model's performance. Afterward, the network weight-based method is implemented to calculate the importance of factors from the trained ANN. The proposed approach was used to analyze RPV adoption in Singapore, and the results indicated that the hybrid-ANN outperforms existing models in predicting and explaining adoption behaviors. The study demonstrates the suitability of adopting ANNs in decision analysis by developing a novel way to construct the hybrid ANN in considering non-linear relationships. In addition, the case study has identified that unfamiliarity with RPV hinders the adoption, emphasized the role of social support in promoting RPV, and proposed three practical policy implications for RPV development in Singapore, which can be extended to residential buildings across the globe.}

Secondly, the spatial econometric estimation validated that the green innovation efficiency among YRD cities finally realized regional co-integration in 2017 with spatial evolution. Finally, the expenditures on technology and education are positive determinants of green innovation efficiency in a city directly. GDP per capita is the positive determinant for co-integration of green innovation efficiency; while foreign direct investment, the proportion of expenditure on technology, and education proportion in local fiscal budget are negative determinants for co-integration of green innovation efficiency in YRD.}

This work was performed in collaboration with a newly founded company to create a technology roadmap for devising a 3D cell culture solution for the fields drug discovery and in vitro disease models. Currently, published literature focuses mainly on the methodology and the application in mature companies and industries and overlooking novel technological multinationals. This paper on the other hand, provides a case of implementing a technology roadmap for a start up technology building product based on an emerging technology in an emerging industry. The paper outlines how it was adopted and implemented successfully in a startup company. The roadmapping process was intended to create a strategic plan that can illustrate to the investors how the acquired resources will be used to develop the product. Additionally, it aimed to assist the company in disclosing diverse gaps and prioritizing efforts and resources to face uncertainty while developing the product and the company. The widespread use of advanced manufacturing has reached the drug discovery and research domain. There is an emerging market with no dominant design; currently, no solution addresses the requirements of the research and industry segments.}

abstract = {The dramatic increase in communications, trade interaction and interdependence has made it necessary to implement new metrics to compare the development rate of nations and their economies. There is much research that analyses the impact of information and communication technology on human development. These studies have analyzed and compared human development indicators (HDI) and information and communication technology (ICT) development index (IDI) from various geographical areas or on a randomized basis. There is much research that analyses the impact of IDI on HDI. This study wants to analyze the economic and digital divide between the countries that make up a region whose economic and cultural relation have a long historical tradition. For this purpose, we chose the countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, since, in addition to these traditional relations, there are recent Euro-Mediterranean association agreements between the European Union and the countries of North Africa and the Middle East, whose objective, among others, is scientific, technical and technological collaboration. The potential relationship between the HDI and the HDI is to be known and whether it can improve the way different countries assess their level of development. The descriptive analysis of the HDI and IDI behavior shows us that human and technological development was progressing with average growth rates of 23% and 2.5%, respectively. Differences between countries also narrowed further in HDI, with a decrease of 7.4%, compared with a 5.2% decrease in IDI. When the conversion was done to the same scale, there was an average difference of 0.2 points between the two index values. Consequently, the Mediterranean countries studied were closer to achieving a rapprochement in human development than in technological development. This study can be used as a tool by policymakers, especially in developing countries, to reinforce their intentions to support the use and implementation of ICT.}

We develop game-theoretical models to investigate these issues in a supply chain considering environmental responsibility behaviors under two scenarios, perfect rationality and bounded rationality. Equal-pricing and differentiated-pricing strategies are given special attention. Under perfect rationality, we find that: (i) for a high unit environmental cost of uncollected used products, to optimize collection rate, the manufacturer makes a trade-off between total environmental cost reduction and the investment in collecting used products, rather than consumers’ demand; (ii) the retailer’s profitability for remanufactured products depends on green consumers partly or fully accepting remanufactured products, especially under equal-pricing; and (iii) when green consumers partly accept remanufactured products, for a medium green consumers’ acceptance degree and a low ordinary consumers’ acceptance degree, differentiated-pricing benefits the manufacturer but hurts the retailer. When there are enough green consumers, the retailer’s interests are aligned with the manufacturer and the supply chain under differentiated-pricing. Under bounded rationality, we find that: (i) compared with perfect rationality, the manufacturer and the retailer decrease the prices for new products and collection rate, and increase the price for remanufactured products, especially under differentiated-pricing; (ii) for a low bounded rationality level, the manufacturer and supply chain are better off by using differentiated-pricing; and (iii) consumers’ multi-dimensional heterogeneities and purchasing uncertainty play important roles in choosing an optimal pricing strategy.}

The specific difficulties in adapting to this new approach pose challenges for Machine Tool (MT) companies, mostly Small and Medium Enterprises (SME). In order to implement a route appropriately, tools such as the Maturity Model (MM) can be very useful, since they help to evaluate the initial state of the company and to plan a development road map. Over the last few years, several MMs geared towards Industry 4.0 have been created and released, some of which are specifically aimed at certain sectors. However, there is none specially developed for an industry of such vital importance as the MT sector. This article presents a new MM adapted to this type of company, with a design based on previously validated developments and standards relating to MM. A representative company in the sector was chosen as a case study for testing the new tool, with excellent results. It was decided that the next step should be to disseminate it to more companies so that it could become a standard MM in the sector.}

However, there are many controversies about whether digital technology can reduce the intensity of carbon emissions. Based on OECD data, KPWW method and multiple panel regression, this paper explores the impact and mechanism of digital technology innovation and technology spillover to the domestic carbon emission intensity. Through impulse response analysis and variance decomposition, the comprehensive impact of digital technology on carbon intensity is clarified. This paper concludes that technology innovation in the information industry will increase the intensity of carbon emissions, while cross-industry technology spillovers are persistent for reducing the intensity of domestic carbon emissions. Since the emission reduction effect of technology spillover is greater than the emission increase effect of technology innovation, the digital technology would empower domestic green development. Increasing the proportion of non-fossil energy use and optimizing the industrial structure are effective mechanisms for digital technology innovation to reduce carbon emission intensity.}

Individuals' self-preserving autonomy, reasoning, ideologies, and ethical status are being compromised due to a growing compulsion for digital consumption, which is leading to the onset of digital harm. This study offers novel insights into the technological interventions that are giving rise to excessive digital consumption leading to digital harm. It also suggests how the effects of such harm can be mitigated through the lenses of two complementary theories: Self-determination theory (SDT) and Agentic theory. We identify five constructs of digital harm through epistemic discourse analysis and use thematic analysis to examine how the digital harm that affects individual rationality, maturity and autonomy can be mitigated by practising attributes of SDT and Agentic theory. This study shows the extent to which SDT and Agentic theory can help to explain how people collectively conceptualize, adapt, define and use the technology that constrains them as self-realizing rational beings.}

However, little is known about how value is co-created and captured in this model. Therefore, this study develops a research model based on the business model framework to examine how the value proposition of full-scene smart service influences the high-order capabilities of value co-creation (technological innovation capability and cooperation capability) and how these specific co-creation capabilities ultimately affect value outcomes. Our model is tested on a three-year panel (2018–2020) of 104 Chinese A-share listed firms providing full-scene smart service. Consistent with our theorizing, we find that value proposition acts as an important business model element to improve a firm's value co-creation capabilities and its economic value and that the value co-creation capabilities drive the firm's economic and social value. In further subsample analyses, we find that the results vary across firms with different levels of value proposition intensity and economic performance. The study contributes to theory and practice by shedding light on the value-creation mechanism of the full-scene smart service model.}

This study, by examining the effect of co-creation on the performance of small and medium manufacturers (SMMs) that supply parts or components to large corporate buyers, found that co-creation does have a significant positive impact on organizational performance through their enhanced strategic advantage. Thus, co-creation is not only important to just large organizations, but even more so to SMMs, as it elevates them from a win-lose relationship to a collaborative partnership with their large buyers. This study makes both theoretical and practical contributions as it is one of the first empirical studies that analyzed the impact of co-creation on SMMs' performance.}

However, implementing DT in healthcare is not straightforward. It requires simultaneously considering technological, political, social, cultural and economic aspects in innovating and delivering services. Moreover, it entails listening to and involving the heterogeneous set of actors in the healthcare ecosystem, in line with user-driven and open innovation logic. Recently Innovation Labs have been acknowledged as an initiative to facilitate innovation, supporting users, customers, and organisations in tackling and providing solutions to business changes and DT challenges. However, there is still a lack of understanding to what extent Innovation Labs can support the digital transformation of healthcare organisations. Through an in-depth case study of a Health Innovation Lab, this paper sheds more light on the role of Innovation Labs and their management as catalysers of innovation and DT in healthcare settings. The research contributes to defining and enhancing the understanding of the structure, functioning and management of Innovation Labs in healthcare organisations. Thus, it explores the potential of Innovation Labs in healthcare settings. From a practical perspective, the study provides suggestions and guidelines for managing healthcare Innovation Labs.

However, while previous studies for technology planning have focused on analyzing the potential of technology, they have not considered the customer-perceived value that technology can create in a new product. Therefore, this research suggests a new approach to assessing the level of technology and evaluating R&D projects, by investigating customer-perceived value on technology through the use of the structural equation model and opinion mining. For this, the assessment framework is developed in terms of technology, product quality, and customer satisfaction, respectively, by investigating a variety of databases on each factor. The relationship between technology level and customer satisfaction is analyzed, using structural equation model and opinion mining. Based on the results, a strategy for technology development is established through gap analysis and simulation, after selecting and evaluating technologies that need to be developed. The proposed approach is applied to the real case of a moving system, in particular an automobile door, and we obtained that an R&D project for hinge-related technology would be promising, enhancing the customer satisfaction. It can suggest a future direction for new technology development. This paper contributes to enhancing the efficiency of technology planning based on the customer-perceived value, enabling the launch of new R&D projects.}

As of 2017, more than 1000 cities in the world have commenced smart city developments, half of which are in China. However, there is not a uniform and clear understanding of smart city systems; this may affect their evaluation/planning and lead to misguided construction. Smart cities are characterized by complex self-organizing systems, and thus their sustainable and healthy development may require following the evolutionary patterns of such systems. Hence, self-organizing system theory may be useful in explaining such cities. Therefore, this paper first performs secondary qualitative data analyses of previous attempts at characterizing smart city development to identify the most robust aspects tested in previous work. Then, incorporating the results, self-organization theory is used to develop an overall, comprehensive system framework of smart cities. In this framework, all types of smart devices are the basic units of development (defined as “smart cells”). Meanwhile, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and developmental mechanisms offer technical support and regulatory mechanisms in the spontaneous operation of smart cities. These three dimensions (smart cells, ICT, and developmental mechanisms) are combined into a scalable and distributed smart city evaluation system. Finally, smart transportation systems and the current state of these in China are used as a case study for discussion.}

To explore this we surveyed attendees of three AI conferences in 2018 about near-to-mid-term AI labor displacement as well as five more extreme labor-displacing AI scenarios. Practitioners indicated that a median of 22% of tasks which humans are currently paid to do could be automated with existing AI; they anticipate this figure rising to 40% in 5 years and 60% in 10 years. Median forecasts indicated a 50% probability of AI systems being capable of automating 90% of human tasks in 25 years and 99% of human tasks in 50 years. Practitioners surveyed at the different conferences had similar forecasts for AI labor displacement this decade, but attendees of the Human-level AI Conference had significantly shorter and more precise forecasts for the more extreme labor-displacing AI scenarios. Interestingly, median forecasts of a 10% probability of 90% and 99% of human tasks being automated were 10 years and 15 years, respectively. We conclude that future of work researchers should more carefully consider these relatively high likelihoods of extreme labor-displacing AI scenarios.}

The findings indicate that for companies in the digital transformation of Industry 4.0, supply chain relationship capital positively affects enterprise green management, which subsequently enhances financial performance. Meanwhile, supply chain relationship capital also indirectly improves companies’ financial performance by leveraging their green management initiatives. Our findings contribute to the literature by enriching the implications of relational capital in supply chains and strengthening the viability of green management. We also provide practical guidance for companies to effectively implement green management programs and exploit their relationship capital.}

abstract = {Using interdisciplinary technologies of Web 2.0, Artificial Intelligence, Operational Research, and Integrated Automatic Manufacturing, this model generates a plausible solution for online taking of laundry orders placed by hotels, accessing path planning through Baidu® external port for scheduling under integrated automatic manufacturing and scheduling architecture. Unlike conventional laundry, this process is transparent to the out-sourcing hotels. With APPs downloaded on their smart phones and order number assigned, the hotel quality control personnel could monitor the whole process in real time, tracking bagging and packing, routing in, scheduling and laundry, then routing back. The whole operation is transparent and efficiency is the name of the game. As a result, this innovative business model solves hotels’ dilemma and soothes contractors’ complaints at the same time. It offers not only the technical modules and infrastructures, but also the business appraisal process as well.}

This paper investigates digital service innovations (DSIs) that use these technologies. Using a service innovation lens, it is distinguished from most prior servitization research through specifying DSIs from incremental to radical modes, rather than measuring service innovation on self-reported scales. Data were collected using expert interviews and secondary sources from 20 manufacturers from four sectors. Using changes from baseline service offerings, the study identified nine DSIs with varying degrees of innovativeness. The paper develops a framework within which each DSI can be placed, with two axes representing innovation mode (incremental, intermediate, radical) and impact of innovation (customer, manufacturer, hybrid). This latter dimension addresses concerns about the lack of focus on customer value in prior service innovation research. The study also develops a new typology of DSI groupings (Business enabler, Service enhancement, Digital service offering) demonstrating that DSIs have mainly enabling or service enhancing roles for manufacturers rather than one that is predominantly designed to create digital service offerings. The exceptions are ‘predictive maintenance’ and ‘process improvement’, which are radical/intermediate DSIs respectively and provide strong value for both manufacturers and customers.}

Statically, our findings reveal that the indexes of the clean energy and new energy innovation industry (green companies) and climate policy uncertainty are drivers of the transmission spillover network, especially in extreme market scenarios. Dynamically, CCRR proxies act as net contributors and/or net receipts of shock spillovers over time and across the quantiles of the joint distribution. We further find that the spillover connectedness network is very sensitive to market states and that the strength of the effects of CCRR proxies are more pronounced under bust and boom markets. Our findings are beneficial for environmental investors and policymakers responsible for portfolio diversification strategies.}

This study investigates the hidden linkage between one of the significant pillars of Industry 4.0 (CERP) and attributes of sustainable organizational performance while considering the effect of variables like firm size, cloud service type, and offerings that enact as control variables while achieving sustainable performance. The proposed hypotheses were empirically examined using primary cross-sectional data.

The literature discerns little on the factors that influence the choice of revenue models for digital services. To address this knowledge gap, we build on a case study approach involving two global manufacturing companies in the railway industry that have experience in offering diverse digital services. The analysis reveals specific features and characteristics of three major revenue models for digital services – namely, subscription, usage-based, and performance-based revenue models. In addition, we identify overarching factors influencing the choice of revenue models for digital services. They are related to a) customer digital readiness, b) digital service sophistication, and c) digital ecosystem partnerships. Building on these influencing factors, we propose a framework that recommends that companies evaluate revenue models in relation to specific digital services. We furnish several theoretical contributions to the digital servitization literature and provide managerial implications for practitioners to assist in the choice of revenue models for digital services.}

The notion of the DPP relies heavily on a suitable digital infrastructure, and it opens the possibility of using the power of artificial intelligence (AI), to optimize circular production within and between Industrial Ecosystems. The benefits of DPPs will only be attained if their design, knowledge engineering, and implementation is well-orchestrated.

We propose a novel and holistic framework of strategic people management that incorporates four dynamic constituents—leadership, culture, learning, networking—that help to acquire, transfer, and create knowledge relevant for a firm’s sustainability. These unbundled constituents interact to create a systematic effect and co-evolve with a firm’s dynamic capabilities.

The research undertakes an in-depth case study based approach. It uses data triangulation, where multiple sources of evidence (interviews, conference audio recordings and documents) are collected from the case organisation (a vendor) and its service ecosystem partners in the ICT sector. The partners included in the study are distributors, channel partners, competitors, and customers. B2B alliances are driven by the motivations to maximise strategic value and minimise transaction cost. Thus, using the ecosystem lens, we find that actors’ capabilities (resources and perceived value), vendor's approach to achieving strategic benefit and the channel governance mechanism enable value co-creation. However, using the transaction cost theory lens, we report that actors’ opportunistic behaviour, technological disruptions and new business model challenges lead to value co-destruction (in the form of termination of relationship, conflict and business liquidation). Alliance partners need to evaluate the strategic benefits of collaboration, knowledge sharing, learning, trust building, market expansion and technology sharing, considering partners’ self-serving behaviour driven by transaction cost economies. All ecosystem actors are seeking to develop capabilities, exhibit knowledge differentiators, demonstrate technology leadership, reduce uncertainty and respond to new business model challenges thus causing value co-destruction. Thus, this research is more encompassing because it explores factors that lead to both value co-creation and co-destruction.}

Results reveal that DI attributes work in three pathways to promote BMI, including organization-oriented with emphasis on improvisation, product-oriented by focusing on user experience and value proposition, and product-organization complemented. When to additionally include IT infrastructure capability for deeper analysis, results demonstrate three more representative configurations among DI attributes and IT infrastructure capability to facilitate BMI: IT-enabled organization-product orchestration, IT-enabled product-organization orchestration, and IT-dominated orchestration.

This analysis explores how the concept of sustainable AI can help to fill this gap. It does so by reviewing how the concept has been used by the research community and aligning research on sustainable development with research on public sector AI. Doing so identifies the utility of boundary conditions that have been asserted for social sustainability according to the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development, and which are here integrated with prominent concepts from the discourse on AI and society. This results in a conceptual model that integrates five boundary conditions to assist public sector decision-making about how to govern AI: Diversity, Capacity for learning, Capacity for self-organization Common meaning, and Trust. These are presented together with practical approaches for their presentation, and guiding questions to aid public sector workers in making the decisions that are required by other operational frameworks for ethical AI.}

The methodology used for this tertiary study is based on Kitchenham and Charter's guidelines [14], resulting in a selection of 30 reviews published between 2005 and 2019 which are reporting results of 2021 primary studies. These reviews cover the AI adoption across various business sectors (healthcare, information technology, energy, agriculture, apparel industry, engineering, smart cities, tourism and transport), management and business functions (HR, customer services, supply chain, health and safety, project management, decision-support, systems management and technology adoption). While the drivers for the AI adoption in these areas are mainly economic, the barriers are related to the technical aspects (e.g. availability of data, reusability of models) as well as the social considerations such as, increased dependence on non-humans, job security, lack of knowledge, safety, trust and lack of multiple stakeholders’perspectives. Very few reviews outside of the healthcare management domain consider human, organisational and wider societal factors of the AI adoption. In addition to increased focus on social implications of AI, the reviews are recommending more rigorous evaluation, increased use of hybrid solutions (AI and non-AI) and multidisciplinary approach to AI design and evaluation. Furthermore, this study found that there is a lack of systematic reviews in some of the early AI adoption sectors such as financial industry and retail.}

Although no explicit specialisation in the topic currently exists, findings highlight the “sustainability imperative” and convergence toward the following research areas: IC components for Sustainable Development in Private Sector, IC for Sustainable Regional Development in the Knowledge Economy, and IC for Sustainable Development in the Public Sector. Discussions indicate that some SDGs are starting to be explored more than others (e.g., quality education, infrastructure, health, cities and communities) and that only recently some studies are specialising specifically in the importance of technology to address the SDGs. Implications for technology policy have been highlighted to frame a future research agenda for academics and practitioners.}

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to critically assess the effect of 3D printing technologies on entrepreneurship. While 3D printing technologies (also known as ‘additive manufacturing’) have been considered as highly transformative technologies, they have been so far (despite over 30 years of existence) restricted to niche markets, and until recently, it seemed that only the largest firms were able to take advantage of those technologies. However, the cost of use of such technologies has sharply decreased over the past few years, and an increasing number of service companies offer both offline (Fab Labs, makerspaces, bureaus) and online (3D printing platforms) access to 3D printing capacities, enabling to “bridge the gap” and provide access to 3D printing technologies to everyone. In this context, using a case-based exploratory methodology, this research aims to explore the benefits of 3D printing technologies for entrepreneurs and new ventures, in particular in relation to overcoming specific challenges these smaller and younger structures face. After identifying the key types of hurdle faced by entrepreneurs – NPD issues, technical issues, market issues, financial issues, and business model issues – this article investigates the manner in which different forms of usage of 3D printing technologies – prototyping, tooling, direct manufacturing, distributed and localised manufacturing – can help alleviate each of those types of barrier. The results of this research indicate that 3D printing technologies are indeed likely to enable entrepreneurs to overcome the five main types of barriers they generally face. Furthermore, because of the very particular situation of entrepreneurs and new ventures and the specific challenges they face in terms of scale, access to markets, and lack of financial resources, 3D printing may in fact be more transformative for smaller and younger structures, than for larger and well-established corporations. However, this research also indicates that benefits for entrepreneurs derived from the use of 3D printing may depend on the degree of involvement of 3D printing in the overall productive process – the more the merrier – and that using 3D printing only at design and tooling stage, although helpful to some extent, may not be so impactful.}

Research shows that some firms perform better than others in continuously discovering, evaluating, and exploiting opportunities in volatile environments and that this is dependent on firm’s dynamic capabilities. Besides obtaining dynamic capabilities through internal R&D activities, firms have open up their innovation process to pursue dynamic capabilities outside their organizational boundaries through external corporate venturing by accessing startup's technological capabilities necessary to innovate. External corporate venturing is a means to develop new distinctive capabilities and businesses by exploring and exploiting business opportunities outside a firm’s existing boundaries. Drawing on the dynamic capability literature, we use a multiple case study approach to examine the contribution of external corporate venturing to firms’ dynamic capabilities. Our results reveal that firms indeed use corporate venturing to identify and exploit startup’s technological knowledge and competencies to increase firm’s dynamic capabilities. But our empirical data also shows that not every firm is fully profiting from all dynamic capability phases as their corporate venturing modes are not linked with each other and cumulative effects are not realized.}

Such decisions regarding the future are part of a firm's foresight, which is a core element of a firm's dynamic capabilities. The contemporary toolbox for generating foresight is dominated by procedural methods, thus ignoring theory-based predictions of the future uses of digital technology. This paper presents the first empirical assessment of business model theory's ability to predict the future uses of digital technology by a given firm. Predictions for a specific niche of hemophilia firms are investigated. Outcomes related to these predictions are then observed. The results show the power of business model theory for deriving such predictions, implying that the managerial toolbox for foresight generation should be extended to include this theory. This study also provides several directions for further development of business model theory to increase its ability to account for value creation and appropriation from the use of digital technology.}

Subsequent transformations in production methods and labor markets stand out broadly among these researches. Technological changes reduce unit costs, enable productions to be conducted with less effort, and increase productivity in productions, whereas the same changes cause the substitution of laborers with machines, driving them out of their employment, and therefore, increasing the number of people unemployed. Given that a consensus about the effects of technology on labor markets hasn't been reached in the existing economic literature, it becomes a requirement to conduct further examinations regarding the interaction between technology and labor markets. To further these examinations, the effects of technological changes on labor markets are set as the aim and therefore, tested empirically to evaluate this empirical objective in a one-way fixed effects model for 30 OECD countries with an annual data set between 2009 and 2018. Based on the findings of the one-way fixed effects model estimated by the Driscoll-Kraay estimator, technological changes induced by patent applications are labor-destructive, whereas technological changes induced by research and development expenditures are positive, yet insignificant on employment. Additionally, gross domestic product and trade openness turn out labor-friendly. The findings set a sound motivator for policymakers about why they should provide more opportunities for workers to increase their flexibility to adapt to technological change and update their skill sets for new forms of production, which also imposes the fact that education and vocational training programs should be expanded and developed to be compatible with new technologies.}

Challenging this assumption, we question the role that costs play in business model design. We analyzed twelve TSU case studies from Switzerland, France, and the USA. The results indicate that TSUs develop three types of business models that are technology-driven, market-driven, and exit-driven. Costs act as enablers, moderators, and mediators. With a portfolio of business models, costs play a mediating role. Finally, the role costs play in the business model design phase changes firm value capture mechanisms, potentially enhancing the firm's value. This research makes the following contributions: (1) Technology-, market-, and exit-driven business model portfolios appear to be heterogeneous among TSUs. (2) Costs play enabler and mediator roles in addition to the traditional moderator role. We add to the literature by focusing on the new economy (rather than Porter's cost leadership strategies) through an optimistic and investment-driven approach.}

Operations managers and scholars place great hopes on recent technological innovations, particularly blockchain technology. However, the current literature lacks a comprehensive review at the intersection of SCRES and blockchain, making it difficult to understand the relations between both fields holistically. This research gap was addressed by systematically analyzing 72 peer-reviewed papers. More specifically, the link between specific blockchain characteristics, SCRES antecedents, and supply chain risk types was explored. The results reveal that visibility and validation are the most relevant blockchain characteristics for improving SCRES. The SCRES antecedents agility, collaboration, and supply chain (re-)engineering can all benefit from blockchain implementation, whereas the effect on risk management culture is widely unexplored. While there is consensus on blockchain’s usability for mitigating security, operational, and supply risks, the effect on demand risks requires further attention. To facilitate the practical implementation of this paper’s results, the findings served as a foundation for discussing SCRES opportunities from well-known blockchain applications such as smart contracts and tracking solutions. Moreover, seven future research avenues and managerial implications are presented.}

abstract = {Supply chain resilience (SCRES) is an emerging research area, which plays a crucial role in protecting supply chains (SCs) against small- to large-scale disruptions. Over the past few years, many researchers have focused on developing SCRES strategies that have significantly contributed to mitigating SC disruptions. While the number of papers on this subject has been gradually increasing, the absence of a systematic literature review means that it is unclear which SCRES strategies for mitigating SC disruptions have already been studied and which issues still need to be investigated. Therefore, there is a need to conduct a systematic literature review to provide a comprehensive overview of SC resilience initiatives and strategies. For the review and synthesis conducted in this paper, 151 relevant articles were identified through a systematic search and selection of papers published between 2010 and 2021. First, the main themes of the SCRES strategies were categorized. The development of SCRES strategies for preparedness, response, and recovery, aimed at mitigating SC disruptions, was reviewed. Second, a detailed analysis of research developments in SCRES strategies was conducted, along with an investigation into the methodological, theoretical, and contextual justifications for tackling SC disruptions. Third, literature on SCRES strategies was synthesized for mapping and identifying potential research gaps. The analysis revealed that there is a scarcity of simulation model-based and theoretically grounded studies to mitigate large-scale SC disruptions. Moreover, it was also found that most studies have identified SCRES strategies for low-demand luxury products, while high-demand essential products and services have largely been ignored. Finally, based on the analysis, this article identifies research questions and future research directions for the field of SCRES research. These can guide academics and practitioners in designing and leading effective research in the field.}

Though the research on SCRM remains for an extended period, still the industries are facing difficulties in managing the SC risks. Also, the SC managers have begun to focus on decision-making based on numerous data sources for predicting the uncertainties more accurately to achieve a proactive and predictive intelligent risk management mechanism. These attributes make Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) suitable techniques in the SCRM field. The application of these techniques in SCRM is in a nascent stage. In this view, this paper presents a systematic and descriptive review of the literature and identifies the various AI and ML methods applied in different phases related to SCRM. Also, it investigates the different categories of SC risks and the existing articles based on the AI technique used. This analysis focuses on research articles related to SCRM from three scientific databases published between 2010 and 2021 for detailed study.

First-mover research has so far not adequately answered this question. Our work contributes to closing this gap by transferring first-mover theory to web-based social enterprises. We expand upon first-mover theory by reflecting on the winner-take-all hypothesis to better illuminate the mechanisms of market structure development and entry decisions. Our empirical data was gathered on various types of web-based social enterprise models in a sample of 12 national markets. Our results show that first-mover advantages are available not only to those who are the very first to market but also to early followers. In addition, the speed of market entry matters. Our work also indicates, however, that first-mover advantages should not be overestimated; market structures and network effects may explain varying results. Furthermore, both business models studied exhibited high market concentration at a mature stage, implying that the winner, although perhaps not taking all, does take most.}

Therefore, the first objective of this research is to contribute to the definition of growth by examining less tangible dimensions of growth. Moreover, the second objective is to identify the characteristics of early-stage digital start-ups experiencing growth. Based on a mixed-methods approach, which combines an adapted Delphi study, a questionnaire-based survey, and a comparative case study, our results suggest that growing digital start-ups exhibit a set of characteristics that include: an agile culture combining clan with adhocracy; the ability to nurture their absorptive, innovative, and adaptive capabilities effectively; and a human capital with adequate entrepreneurial skills, emotional attachment to and fitness with the start-up.}

Performance expectancy (β = 0.325), effort expectancy (β = 0.202), facilitating conditions (β = 0.097), hedonic motivation (β = 0.213), habit (β = 0.228), and trust (β = 0.218) are significantly related with behavioral intention, while social influence (β = −0.036) and price value (β = 0.022) are not significant factors. Facilitating conditions (β = 0.206), habit (β = 0.203), trust (β = 0.392), and behavioral intention (β = 0.317) are the significant determinants of use behavior toward live e-commerce shopping. Four demographic variables, including gender, age, education, and income, release the significant moderating effects in the theoretical model. This research helps e-commerce platforms and retail stores develop effective strategies to activate consumers' adoption of live e-commerce shopping.}

In two studies, the authors explore the impact of stories and narrative transportation in advertising on decision makers’ attitudinal responses. In Study 1, findings from a Fortune 100 company’s buyer panel indicate that stories told using narrative advertising were positively related to the decision maker’s trust in the supplier, ability to form personal connections with the supplier and the tendency to advocate for the supplier. Moreover, the organizational status of the decision maker (C-suite versus non-C-suite executives) was examined. Results demonstrate that the effect of these relationships were stronger for C-level decision makers than non-C-level decision makers. In Study 2, depth interviews were conducted with C-level decision makers. Findings reinforce results from Study 1 and provide additional insight into C-level decision makers’ perspectives on stories and narrative transportation. Implications for how stories about buyer-seller relationships can benefit organizational decision making are discussed.}

Simultaneously, the IUR cooperative intensity and control capability of cooperative network of YRD cities have increased gradually. However, the IUR R&D efficiency and IUR transformation efficiency both haven’t reached the optimal level in YRD, and the transformation efficiency is always less than R&D efficiency. The pilot policy has a positive effect on improving IUR innovation efficiency. The policy effects for provincial capital cities are greater than those for non-provincial capital cities. Provincially, the pilot policy on IUR collaborative innovation efficiency reaches highest in Zhejiang and lowest in Jiangsu. The IUR cooperative intensity and control capability of cooperative network have partial intermediary effect on pilot policy.}

Thus, this research builds on the theoretical perspective of corporate ecological responsiveness and proposes three types of strategic drivers for green IT initiatives (economic, authority, and moral drivers). How various types of organizations may be motivated by these green IT initiative drivers will affect whether organizations can reconcile the objectives of environmental sustainability and business profitability. We further deduce findings from multiple case studies of eight organizations in China and Singapore. The findings illustrate that the characteristics of any given organization influence why various driving factors affect their green IT initiative decisions. Additionally, “doing good” and “doing well” are reconciled when organizations consider the short-term investment and long-term benefit, design appropriate strategy, and receive severe external pressure. We also discuss contributions to research and practice.}

The impact of three clusters of SC capabilities (organisational capability, SC flexibility, SC integration) on firm resilience (proactive, reactive or dynamic) is examined, and that of the impact of firm resilience on performance. We find that the overall impact of resilience on firm performance is strongly significant. However, in terms of financial performance, the correlation magnitude shows a weaker to moderate effect. In addition, for non-financial performance, the resilience impact is stronger. Furthermore, the analysis helps clarify some of the existing inconsistencies in the literature regarding the relationship between SC capabilities, firm resilience and performance by highlighting the moderating role played by resilience operationalisation, industry affiliation and national culture. The study contributes to theory on resilience and assists practitioners in developing resilient strategies for organisations and SCs.}

Hence, this study aimed to determine the association of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment, price consciousness, perceived risk, trust, and personal innovativeness with attitude and intention to use chatbots for shopping. Respondents were asked to fill a questionnaire after using a Facebook e-commerce chatbot that was specifically created for this study. In total, 350 responses were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Results indicated that attitude toward chatbots was considerably influenced by the variables perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment, price consciousness, perceived risk, and personal innovativeness. However, intention to use was directly influenced only by trust, personal innovativeness, and attitude. Mediation analysis indicated that full mediation occurs through the attitude variable for most direct relationships. Moderation analysis by using age, gender, and prior experience with mobile shopping applications indicated considerable differences between the groups in terms of the strength of certain relationships and the mean responses between the variables.}

However, the mortality rate of these ecosystems is high, particularly in their nascent stages, due to the fact that new focal firms lack a holistic, in-depth understanding of ecosystems' systemic, dynamic, and complex nature. To enhance understanding in this domain, a metatheoretical-level knowledge of the conceptual boundaries of ecosystems, that is, the aggregation of ecosystems' key features, is required. By systematically reviewing and synthesizing 84 articles, the present study developed a theoretical framework indicating that the coherence of the nine key lower-order features of ecosystems can be aggregated into three higher-order dimensions: roles (self-organization, non-linearity, shared vision), structures (complementarity, modularity, coupling) and processes (emergence, co-opetition, co-evolution). These higher-order dimensions exhibit temporal differences across the ecosystem development process. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive and general framework of the aggregated conceptual boundaries of ecosystems that highlights the basic guiding principles of any ecosystem approach within the field of innovation management. It can thereby contribute to ongoing debates pertaining to the differences between innovation and business ecosystems as well as allowing for an explanation of the differences in the developmental stages of ecosystems, from birth to maturity.}

We model an online supply chain which contains customers and one e-commerce retailer. By using simulation, we compare the dynamic performance in a supply chain for two scenarios, namely adopting an online review system and without adopting the system. The supply chain dynamic performance is measured by bullwhip effect and inventory variance amplification. The results demonstrate that the online review system increases both the bullwhip effect and inventory variance amplification, and this impact can be moderated by product quality, unit mismatch cost, lead time, and customer volatility. We further explore how our model could be extended to include market competition, dual sourcing, online review manipulation, and product returns. As the increase in the bullwhip effect and inventory variance amplification can be associated with supply chain inefficiency, managers who are aware of such consequences induced by online review adoption can make better decisions in supply chain management.}

A qualitative analysis using in-depth interviews and multiple case studies identifies prominent barriers and incentives, whilst a quantitative analysis on a representative sample of 500 local manufacturing units in Piedmont (a region of Northern Italy) is undertaken via an OLS regression-based path analysis. The results of the parallel-serial multiple mediation model show that: (1) greater openness to Industry 4.0 is related to better performance; (2) greater openness to Industry 4.0 leads to a higher perception of barriers; (3) greater knowledge-related and economic and financial barriers improve performance, abstracting from the adoption of incentives; and (4) greater openness to Industry 4.0 drives the adoption of incentives. However, perceived economic and financial barriers are found not to drive firms to adopt more incentives. The study contributes to the Industry 4.0 literature by identifying previously unidentified strengths and weaknesses to barriers and incentives, and highlights the necessity of policies that reflect real firms’ needs.}

This study aims to provide a framework for a sustainable and environmentally friendly closed-loop supply chain network with dual-channel (online channel and offline channel). The goal is to assist managers in making economically and environmentally sustainable decisions. Accordingly, a multi-period mathematical model is designed to address the challenges of the appliance industry, which faces uncertain demand. The model considers the carbon cap-and-trade policy, the regional protection policy of the retailer, and multiple transport modes in the design of the supply chain network. To handle demand uncertainty, we propose a robust model that utilizes a data-driven polyhedral uncertainty set based on principal component analysis and kernel smoothing methods and transforms the robust model into a mixed-integer linear programming problem. Additionally, we present a two-stage adaptive genetic algorithm to effectively tackle the large-scale and complex nature of the supply chain network. Extensive computations are performed to verify the algorithm's effectiveness. Finally, sensitivity analysis is conducted on key parameters to gain valuable insights. The results demonstrate that an increase in online consumers can significantly reduce stockouts, while an increase in uncertain demand leads to a substantial increase in the total cost.}

Moreover, the integration of these six complexity properties offers an overarching understanding of how the Zhongguancun EE maintained its viability over time.

It reports the findings of a series of five focus groups to explore the role of public deliberation in informing ethical data practices in banking. The findings indicate that deliberative forms of public engagement present valuable opportunities to incorporate diverse views and perspectives and to enable critical reflection on organisational practices and the trajectory of innovation. We conclude that public engagement is vital to ensure that private sector organisations move beyond “ethics-washing” or tokenistic efforts at Corporate Digital Responsibility (CDR) to meaningfully address public concerns and reflect public values in all innovation processes.}

It bridges several research gaps in MR investigation, demonstrating unexplored causal relationships between the functionality of MR devices and museum experiences and post-experience behaviours, which have been investigated separately. The research confirms that MR advances empower the museum's mission of heritage valorisation and education, which drive new immersive experiences and behaviours. It introduces insights to overcome technological limitations as a challenge for practitioners as well as a flourishing area of investigation.}

After more than two decades of successful internationalization, can the survival of Chinese and Indian investments reveal the factors that are associated with the success of EMNC investments in the North and the South? This is the main question we explore in this paper. We find that there is a North-South divide in the survival of Chinese and Indian outward investments. Investments in the North are subject to more intense competitive pressure due to the stronger technological and managerial abilities of domestic firms and survival is markedly weaker there. In Southern locations, where Chinese and Indian firms enjoy competitive advantages and industrial leadership in several areas, they also have better rates of survival. Apart from highlighting the role of relative (to host country firms) firm-specific advantages in explaining survival in the North and South, we also find that a larger diaspora in Southern locations is associated with greater survival.}

This study determined the constructs that are critical to creating sustainable supply chains. A three-phase Delphi approach involving qualitative and quantitative analyses was carried out. Feedback was obtained from 18 international experts who are very knowledgeable about collaboration and sustainable supply chains. Initially, 24 independent constructs that can be regarded as sub-dimensions of the dimensions making up the UN Global Compact were identified. However, sub-questions directed at all opportunities and challenges that are encountered at both corporate and supply chain levels yielded 38 constructs. Finally, eight key constructs were identified as highly critical to supply chain sustainability. No study has directly extracted the sub-dimensions of the UN Global Compact dimensions, and most research focused on economic and environmental sustainability while neglecting social sustainability. The current work is an attempt to address these gaps. Additionally, the research directed attention to the neglected relationship between collaborative forecasting and supply chain sustainability.}

To improve the performance and sustainability of logistics processes, managers should analyze the risks in such processes and implement risk mitigation measures to reduce their negative impact on system integrity. The adoption of new technologies in risk mitigation planning can help managers improve the performance of logistics processes. This study proposes a sequential dynamic approach for analyzing the risks and assessing the effectiveness of risk mitigation measures in an uncertain environment. The causal relationships between risks of logistics processes are extracted after the risk identification based on the process-oriented perspective. Afterward, a multi-expertise team employs the Z-number theory-based linguistic variables to determine the value of triple risk parameters for each risk (i.e., probabilities of destructiveness, occurrence, and undetectability). In this phase, the multi-expertise team’s opinions are aggregated using an extended version of Dempster-Shafer’s evidence theory in the Z-number environment to consider uncertainty and reliability simultaneously. Then, the sequential dynamic model of the identified risks is developed using the Bayesian belief network. This model enables decision-makers to identify the critical risks in each logistics sub-process and assess risk mitigation measures, defined by focusing on new technologies. The proposed model is used to estimate the effectiveness of risk mitigation measures after determining the impressionable risks in their implementation. The results of this study imply that new technology-based solutions can improve critical sub-processes (i.e., resource planning, procurement, and production planning) significantly.}

Our findings are that while fab labs and makerspaces naturally foster some entrepreneurial 21st century skills, only explicit and proactive entrepreneurship and education programme enable to foster the whole spectrum of these skills. In regard to technical skills, fab labs and makerspaces enable to develop skills beyond what is generally considered as 21st century digital skills, because they combine digital skills with hands-on ‘making’ skills, since they are themselves mixed environment, both digital and physical. Consequently, the growing importance of ‘maker technologies’ may force to redefine what 21st century skills should be.}

In this paper, we present an automated tool, called the Manufacturing Process Failure Diagnosis Tool (MPFDT) that can detect and isolate the faults and anomalies in the PLC controlled manufacturing systems effectively. MPFDT utilizes two independent knowledge-based process behaviour models of the manufacturing system to satisfy the FADI purpose. The fundamental idea is to detect the inconsistencies between the modelled and the observed manufacturing process behaviour. The first model is a Deterministic Finite-state Automaton (DFA) based model of the PLC control process that is used to determine whether the observed state transition behaviour of the PLC control process is consistent with the modelled state transition behaviour or not. The second model is basically a set of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based one-class classifiers that are used to identify whether any significant difference exist between the observed and the reference electrical power consumption profile of the manufacturing system or not. The experimental results show that the FADI accuracy rate of the proposed tool is very high (more than 98%).}

As the human limits of performance have been reached in many disciplines, reaching future limits will increasingly depend on technology. While this represents progress in how athletes train and compete, similar developments await sports managers in the way they lead sports organizations and sports consumers in the way they consume and engage with sports. Using the SportsTech Matrix (i.e., a framework to capture how different types of technologies provide solutions to different user groups in sports), we examine how technology will impact sports in the future. We present a Delphi-based prospective study with quantitative and qualitative assessments from 92 subject matter experts for six future projections and 35 non-Delphi prospective survey items. We find that, by 2030, technology will significantly impact all three user groups in sports: athletes, consumers, and managers. For athletes, experts anticipate technology to play a major role for sporting performance improvements. For consumers, the consumption of sports content will continue to change significantly. For management, new types of manager profiles in terms of backgrounds and skill sets would be desirable. We discuss two possible future scenarios: (1) a probable future and (2) a game changer. Our findings should provide relevant insights for decision-makers and other stakeholders in sports and raise promising directions for future research.}

abstract = {Practitioners have long known that item-level tracking of products with the aid of radio frequency identification (RFID) has an exceptionally high potential for application with omnichannel fulfillment. Investments in both RFID and omnichannel expanded, but there was a lack of studies to assess their benefits. The introduction of omnichannel retailing is a big challenge for managers since it demands higher stocking levels due to the higher shrinkage cost. This research focuses on modeling one of the promising RFID applications: in-store merchandise tracking on item level. This model shows how a combination of consumers' response to stockout in omnichannel retailing coupled with item-level RFID tracking ensures inventory reduction, leading to higher on-shelf availability and lower cost. Thus, a modeling approach allows defining the value of the costly investment in the in-store location tracking in omnichannel fulfillment. A comparison is made between three scenarios: no-omnichannel and no-RFID; omnichannel without RFID; and omnichannel with RFID. In addition, this study examines under which parameters of costs, backlogging, brand and store switching, and other conditions one scenario could be more profitable for a retailer than another. The main finding of the study suggests the retailer's profitability could increase significantly as a result of the combined effect of investment in omnichannel fulfillment and item-level RFID. At the same time, the optimal inventory could be reduced. This study supports evidence of the higher return on investment in item-level RFID tracking of fashion products in omnichannel retailing.}

Then, it addresses the dynamic capabilities to create indispensable knowledge for decision-making in these three topics through empirical insight from a multi-case study in four tech-enabled corporations in the Iranian entrepreneurial e-commerce ecosystem. The results indicate two plannable and unplannable categories as organizational and group level capabilities for each recognized KITs, respectively. The proposed innovation intelligence framework represents how these capabilities are interrelated and the effect of strengthening and weakening them on the co-creation process by affecting collective intelligence. The results can provide insight to tech-enabled corporations in employing innovation intelligence to overcome a dipole between corporations and startups, which results in managing the co-creation process effectively. Also, it contributes to constantly filling the dynamic innovation gap between the expectations of innovation co-creation and actual achievements among managers during the co-creation process.}

Through a systematic literature review, we identify 54 papers to analyze and discuss issues related to data collection, data quality, and data mining. This paper summarizes a framework for social media-based public opinion analysis as well as the commonly employed data mining methodologies. We found that collecting public opinion data from Facebook and Weibo is difficult because of their restricted application programming interface and measures against Web Crawler. How to effectively and conveniently delete invalid data and how to design data mining methods for social media data, especially for those in Chinese, are still two main challenges in social media-based public opinion analysis. We claim that using multiple data sources, optimizing keyword settings, enhancing interdisciplinary cooperation, and paying more attention to the functional role of social media can benefit the development of social media-based public opinion analysis. This study also highlights the potential risks of releasing the personal information of the public in the use of social media data in research.}

Current literature describes the diverse outcomes from IoT that enable servitization but fails to explain the reasons behind the diversity and the processes manufacturers go through to create these outcomes. This study aims to identify these processes by drawing on affordance theory and its core principles of affordance perception (understanding an opportunity provided by technology) and affordance actualisation (taking advantage of an opportunity provided by technology). By using affordance theory to analyse the case scenarios of six manufacturing firms, the study develops a framework to explain the realisation of the opportunities the IoT provides to manufacturers' servitization efforts. The analysis identifies three types of affordances and actualisation processes that help manufacturers realise the opportunities of the IoT. This framework enables manufacturers to systematically manage the contributions from the IoT and the associated actualisation efforts required to advance servitization. The study adds to the understanding of the IoT's role in a manufacturing servitization context.}

It is hence no surprise that the retail sector is one of the hardest-hit sectors in the current pandemic. To understand the short- and longer-term impacts of COVID-19 on retail, we conducted two surveys to understand ongoing changes in the sector. By contrasting changing consumer behavior with the actions taken by local retailers, we assess whether the current pandemic is potentially a catalyst for e-commerce in Belgium. We do this based on a newly constructed framework of e-retail accessibility, as the differences between online and physical retail require a revision of the traditional economic geographical perspective on retail performance as introduced by Christaller (1933). We conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic holds ample opportunities for an increase in the three components of e-retail accessibility, but that a lack of professionalism might prevent traditional local retailers to retain a share of the expanded online market. This could well mean the final blow for local brick and mortar shops if, as is predicted, the share of online shopping in total retail expenditure remains high after the pandemic.}

We offer a framework that explains how key microfoundations of sensing, seizing, and transforming capabilities are developed and deployed in different stages of the collaboration.

The statistical results showed that an increase in both openness and distinctiveness facilitates radical-oriented behavior, while the sales of complementary goods rise as openness increases at the medium level of distinctiveness. Consequently, this study indicates that high openness and appropriate distinctiveness contribute to securing ambidexterity on the platform ecosystems to facilitate balanced software development and larger sales performance.}

In this context, digital servitization requires the actors involved to perform new roles and develop new capabilities. Although servitization actor capabilities in the digital transformation context have been addressed in prior studies, the literature lacks a detailed understanding of how they operate according to different service types and different actor roles. Through a systematic literature review, our study aims to expound the capabilities required for digital servitization, for Base, Intermediate, and Advanced services, and analyze who of the main actors of the service triad (manufacturer, intermediaries, and customer) should own such capabilities. This analysis resulted in a final sample of 47 main articles addressing capabilities. We show how the structure of the service triad shifts the digital service provision based on the capabilities required by each actor. For instance, Base Services demand less capabilities, thus, intermediary actors play a less important role since they just execute services usually on behalf of a manufacturer in a more discrete capacity. For Intermediate Services, the intermediary actor becomes more important, with capabilities needed to deliver the digital solution. In Advanced Services, customers' relationships with manufacturers become stronger, as this actor reassumes a central role in the solution offer, and intermediaries move to a supporting role again. Our analysis offers propositions for future research on digital servitization and practical implications on the capabilities required.}

Results from a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) of 63 industrial service SMEs show that these firms attain high service innovation performance with three different configurations under conditions of high uncertainty. Two configurations highlight the importance of IT exploration capabilities (combined with the absence of innovation and networking capabilities in one configuration and with the absence of networking capabilities and IT capabilities for exploitation in another), whereas another configuration accentuates the importance of IT exploitation capabilities (combined with the presence of innovation and networking capabilities). Our study contributes to the literature in multiple ways. For instance, due to the equifinal properties of the configurational approach, our results suggest that SMEs can attain high innovation performance through both sequential and simultaneous IT ambidexterity, thus providing a starting point for reconciling competing views of IT ambidexterity. Other contributions to theory and practice and avenues for future research are also discussed.}

This method was trialled at two Australian organisations and positively evaluated in a US foreign exchange trading business. Our empirical evidence challenges the underlying assumption that higher levels of process capability depend on the achievement of lower level process attributes.

We argue that eulogising only the positive aspects of open innovation is insufficient to help firms and motivate future research. Therefore, we recommend increased attention to the dark side of open innovation, which includes failures that can occur at various stages of the open innovation process. A review of the existing literature reveals that although researchers have, time and again, attempted to document failure in open innovation, this literature is comparatively sparse and fragmented. The extant literature also exhibits an apparent lack of effort to encourage future research, as evidenced by the absence of a comprehensive literature review. We aim to address this research gap by reviewing 76 studies identified by applying a stringent search protocol consistent with the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology. The contributions of this SLR include (a) development of a research profile of the relevant literature, (b) identification of five thematic areas, (c) elucidation of research gaps and suggestion of potential research questions as an agenda for future research on failures in open innovation, (d) formulation of a conceptual framework comprising the antecedents and outcomes of open innovation failure and (e) presentation of the various theoretical and managerial implications for scholars and practitioners.}

We address this gap using cognitive-affective personality system theory to explain how macrolevel development affects employee behavior. Existing data on industry digital maturity were combined with survey data of 710 higher education graduates from various organizations and industries collected at two separate time points. The results support the hypothesized positive indirect effects of industry digital maturity on proactive skill development via employees’ interpretation of digitalization as controllable and as an opportunity for their organization.

This study attempts to fill this research gap by conducting a review of the work on data analytics in TF published in leading journals in the field of technology and innovation management. We first develop a process-focused morphological matrix that provides a simple yet comprehensive view and enables the full spectrum of data analytics in TF to be examined. Specifically, the matrix consists of four dimensions and 12 factors: (1) awareness of TF contexts (objective, time horizon, field and level of analysis); (2) data collection and pre-processing (data source, data item and measure); (3) data analysis and validation (approach, methodology and performance evaluation); and (4) value creation (outcome and implication). A thorough presentation of the literature is then provided after the configurations of each article are identified. Accordingly, we also examine the practical implications of the process-focused morphological matrix and suggest future research directions in the field.}

Despite the role that creative and cultural and creative firms (CCFs) have in the economic development of industrialised countries, they tend to remain small and often fail due to industry-specific constraints and tensions, such as the lack of managerial capabilities and complexity in nurturing value chain relationships. However, there has been relatively limited scholarly interest into the specific conditions and processes that enabled CCFs to overcome these liabilities, and in particular into the identification of the business models they have adopted along their life-cycle. In this paper, this issue is analysed by using the concept of BMI, which sheds light on how the reconfiguration of the activity system through which a CCF creates, delivers and captures value enables the exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities over time. This paper builds on an in-depth historical study of three leading firms operating in the mobile gaming industry, namely Rovio, Zynga and King Digital Entertainment. Three main results emerge from this study. First, in the ramp-up phase of their life-cycle, CCFs organize their resource architecture to build a strong and recognized reputation. Second, in the development phase, BMI is used to leverage new distribution paradigms. Finally, in the maturity phase, firms dedicate resources to innovate their product portfolios by providing platforms that support the development and testing of new creative ideas and solutions. Findings and implications are then discussed.}

Logistics services serve as a vital link between fresh e-commerce and customers, playing a pivotal role in enhancing customer satisfaction and fostering the sustainable growth of businesses. Therefore, this study endeavors to investigate the correlation between logistics service quality and customer satisfaction within the context of fresh e-commerce, while also identifying the pivotal factors that impact logistics service quality. Initially, a novel logistics service quality measurement scale is developed based on the SERVQUAL model. Then, the study formulates the first hypothesis testing model using customer expectations and perceived value as mediating variables. Subsequently, incorporating the service encounter theory, the constructed logistics service quality measurement factors are re-clustered to establish distinct encounter dimensions and to formulate the second hypothesis testing model, which includes mediating variables of customer emotions and perceived value. Finally, empirical data are gathered and subjected to regression analysis and structural equation modeling to mutually validate both models employing identical input indicators. Results suggest that logistics service quality significantly impacts customer satisfaction across the delineated factors within the five dimensions of the SERVQUAL model, alongside the four aspects of service encounters. Moreover, in the fresh e-commerce sector, customer perceived value, service expectations, and customer emotions play crucial mediating roles between logistics service quality and customer satisfaction. These findings hold practical implications for fresh e-commerce businesses aiming to enhance the service quality of logistics operations and achieve sustainable development in a customer-centric market context.}

This research confirms empowerment as a second-order construct consisting of six dimensions namely, decision making, discretionary skills, information access, knowledge, tools and training. The predictive power of the scale is validated through PLSc and PLSpredict (k = 10) using a training sample (n = 274) and a holdout sample (n = 30). Theoretically, this work extends FLE empowerment to analytics-driven services. Practically, the study informs managers to complement their investments in technology with an internal orientation program to empower FLEs to effectively link with customers and seize opportunities.}

This work has two purposes: first, to empirically test the “social impact” hypothesis of stakeholder theory, which assumes that CRS positively impacts EP; second, to analyze the moderating effect of the MSME size on this hypothesis. The results obtained using the PLS-SEM technique based on a sample of 278 Spanish firms confirm that MSMEs that carry out CSR activities in their economic, social and environmental aspects improve their economic performance, and this relationship is moderated by the size of these organizations; the larger the size is, the stronger the relationship is.}

This paper aims to identify potential threats faced by the labour market in Slovakia, which based on the analysis, employs a significant number of workers in areas susceptible to automation. According to the results, industrial production in Slovakia is divided into several areas, where almost 41% of all industrial workers are employed in the manufacture of metal constructions, machinery and equipment, motor vehicles, semitrailers and trailers and the number of people employed in this sector is increasing linearly over the reference period from 2008 to 2016. The paper focuses on potential scenarios that may arise in the labour market in the near future, using Cobb-Douglas production function. In the original model, the production function of the company is based on production factors in which labour plays an important role. However, with the growth of automation, the original model of companies is changing, transforming, and workforce who has played the key role in the production process of goods or services are becoming redundant due to the growing autonomy of machines. The analyzed scenarios show situations that may arise in the labour market if a company changes the scale of the use of production factors in its production process. In other words, given the current situation as labour costs increase, the power and capabilities of machines are growing and a company wants to stay competitive on the global market.}

This study explores the impact of tax uncertainty on firm innovation speed using a sample of A-share listed companies from 2008 to 2020. Tax uncertainty retards firm innovation speed mainly by exacerbating corporate information asymmetry and enhancing corporate risk aversion. Lower tax incentives and high innovation novelty weaken this negative effect. Additionally, using tax reform as a quasi-natural experiment, we discover that, during the tax reform, firms affected by the reform experienced a significant increase in tax uncertainty relative to unaffected firms, and such firms showed considerably slower innovation. This study explores the effect of tax uncertainty on firm innovation speed from the perspective of micro-enterprises, emphasizes the identification and proactive management of tax risks by firms themselves, expands research on the economic consequences of tax uncertainty and enriches research on the characteristics of firm innovation.

abstract = {Journalists, emergency responders, and the general public use Twitter during disasters as an effective means to disseminate emergency information. However, there is a growing concern about the credibility of disaster tweets. This concern negatively influences Twitter users’ decisions about whether to retweet information, which can delay the dissemination of accurate—and sometimes essential—communications during a crisis. Although verifying information credibility is often a time-consuming task requiring considerable cognitive effort, researchers have yet to explore how people manage this task while using Twitter during disaster situations. To address this, we adopt the Heuristic-Systematic Model of information processing to understand how Twitter users make retweet decisions by categorizing tweet content as systematically processed information and a Twitter user’s profile as heuristically processed information. We then empirically examine tweet content and Twitter user profiles, as well as how they interact to verify the credibility of tweets collected during two disaster events: the 2011 Queensland floods, and the 2013 Colorado floods. Our empirical results suggest that using a Twitter profile as source-credibility information makes it easier for Twitter users to assess the credibility of disaster tweets. Our study also reveals that the Twitter user profile is a reliable source of credibility information and enhances our understanding of timely communication on Twitter during disasters.}

The study constructs an inter-provincial Chinese economic uncertainty spillover network using a high dimesion dataset and assembles the provincial social network using microblog data. Furthermore, the exponential random graph model is used to analyze the impact of social networks. The findings indicate that the social network significantly hinders the formation of an economic uncertainty spillover network, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, the impact of social networks is found to be more statistically significant than that of population and other attributes. While most existing research has focused on the influence of social networks from a microeconomic perspective, this study contributes to the literature by uncovering a robust negative relationship between social networks and economic uncertainty spillover networks, particularly curbing the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.}

We analyze this tradeoff when companies face market and technological turbulence. We follow the capability-based switching costs theory, which considers the cost resulting from customer efforts to create new capabilities related to the solution offered by product firms. We propose that customized services help create these switching costs in turbulent environments. We also consider the mediating role of service-centric business models and the moderating role of cross-functional knowledge integration in these relationships. We combined data from a survey of 104 firms and secondary industry-level data on turbulence and analyzed it with regression techniques. Results show that, in turbulent environments, companies increase service customization instead of standardization and enhance service-centric business models, which benefits customer loyalty (a measure of capability-based switching costs). Companies focused on knowledge integration were less sensitive to technological turbulence and could better develop service activities for customization. We extend the service theory connecting it to the capability-based switching cost view and explain service provision mechanisms in turbulent environments. Managers can learn what to consider to implement a servitized business model in turbulent environments.}

It motivates the manufacturing and service system to ascend to the middle and upper levels of the value chain. First, the relationship between service-oriented manufacturing and the logic behind value growth is deconstructed. The mechanism of service-oriented manufacturing is elucidated at the levels of the manufacturing network, service network, and integration network. Second, the manufacturing, service and innovation relationships formed in the industry chain are analyzed in terms of the supply chain of the manufacturing network, service chain of the service network, and innovation chain of the integration network. The coordinated hypernetwork model of service-oriented manufacturing is also established. The node relationships and value flows of each sub-network are resolved using variational inequalities according to the principle of each chain operation. The coordinated optimal solution of the hypernetwork is clarified. Additionally, issues concerning the enhancement of equilibrium profits in the hypernetwork are investigated. Finally, we use numerical simulation for specific situations in the hypernetwork of enterprises. Using the strong correlation network of potential value growth of firms generated by social network analysis, a feasible strategy for coordinated optimization of service-oriented manufacturing is proposed. This study finds that the manufacturing equilibrium formula emphasizes that service-oriented manufacturing firms must break the previous industrial separation and obtain the value-added profits from the iteration of manufacturing and service models to enhance the possibility of risk investment in integration innovation. According to the service equilibrium formula, enterprises must avoid the inferior market of services and excessive concentration of resources. Firms strengthen the access mechanisms of service-oriented manufacturing activities by revising the service model and introducing manufacturing operations. In the integration equilibrium formula, the linear feature of innovation indicates that firms should continuously invest in innovation construction and conduct innovation integration activities without incurring losses. Second, the main chain (supply chain, innovation chain) relationship between the manufacturing sub-network and integration sub-network is stronger than the other node relationships. The service network exhibits the characteristics of a weaker service chain than external nodes. Manufacturing value flows are concentrated on middle and downstream manufacturing activities. Service value flows are aggregated by market-oriented principles. Innovation value flows primarily exhibit continuous input and inherited innovation characteristics. Third, technology application, service penetration, the integration scale of manufacturing and service markets, and the market acceptance scale of service and manufacturing are essentially homogeneously related to the manufacturing relationship, service relationship, and innovation relationship, which positively stimulate the activity of value flows in each network. The cost and attrition of technology and service show inhibitory effects on value flows. Fourth, in the value network, the manufacturing value flows of the manufacturing relationship form a U-shape along with the industrial chain. The service value flow of the market is robust and exhibits a “tick”-like pattern in the service network. The innovation value network is mainly attached to the innovation chain and displays point-scattering characteristics.}

Digitalization as a business enabler has speeded and scaled innovation in many firms. As the corporate leader, the CEO facilitates strategic agility and enhances network effects to create value. This study uses innovation efficiency as the proxy of digitalization to examine the contribution of the CEO networks to firm-level innovation efficiency in Chinese listed firms. Using 13,516 firm-year observations in Chinese listed high-tech firms between 2007 and 2017, we apply a frontier analysis approach (e.g., DEA and SFA) and measure innovation efficiency based on the scale ratio of innovation output (i.e., patent counts) and input (R&D investment and R&D personnel). First, we find that innovation is more efficient when CEO has more outside directorships. Second, a significant and positive relationship exists between a well-connected CEO and innovation efficiency when the newly appointed CEO has larger networks than the predecessor. Third, the positive relationship between a well-connected CEO and innovation efficiency disappears when the number of outside directorships is above the yearly median level. This empirical study provides evidence for the network effects of a CEO for improving innovation efficiency. The findings emphasize the contingent value of the CEO's external social capital on agility, especially the multiple directorships in a transitional economy.}

There is a scarcity of research about digital transformation in the energy sector, so this paper aims to analyze this phenomenon in the Oil & Gas sector through a comparative case analysis of eight market leading European Oil & Gas companies. To ensure an adequate methodological approach, the authors have applied Eisenhardt's framework to build theories from case study research. This article relies on multiple data collection methods. 26 interviews with 18 senior executives from the sample energy firms and two global consulting firms were completed in two separate phases. To complement these interviews, information and data were collected from a range of public sources, such as newspapers, video interviews, business magazines and analyst reports, as well as public information from the eight companies under analysis, such as annual and financial reports, company presentations, regulatory filings and announcements and company news. Our research highlights several transformational moves in the firms under study that bring substantial new capabilities and allow them to achieve market-leading positions in new and digitally native business areas -although modest in size. The sample firms mainly opt for combinations of small transformational strategies to achieve their large transformation goals. However, in many organizations, digital and business transformation initiatives suffer from poor governance and are typically just a collection of unconnected activities, piecemeal strategies and pilot projects. Developing a coherent transformation strategy, with the right structure and governance, remains a challenge for most organizations. This paper, leveraging the collective learnings from the eight companies studied, aims to help decision-makers with a conceptual guideline to select the most appropriate strategic tools when undergoing a transformation, based on four dimensions that are of high relevance across multiple strategic environments.}

We investigate these research questions by utilizing probabilistic machine learning models trained on thousands of expert ratings, provided by both healthcare practitioners and automation experts. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to analyze the desirability of automating healthcare work activities (human workforce preferences) in combination with current technological capabilities. We present a succinct four quadrant model, the Automatability-Desirability Matrix, based on our findings. It can be used to support policymakers and organizational leaders in developing practical strategies on how to harness the positive power of AI, while accompanying change and empowering stakeholders in a participatory fashion. Furthermore, we observe that healthcare professionals desire a surprisingly high proportion of their work activities to be fully automated, while being less optimistic about the current automation potential of healthcare work than technical experts. Our results represent the first detailed quantitative empirical evidence of healthcare practitioners’ preferences regarding the automation of work and the first direct comparison of the potential for automation as based on the perspectives of technical experts and those working as healthcare practitioners.}

However, extant literature lacks in explanation for the diffusion and forecast of these services in India. We address this gap by analyzing both individual and multigenerational diffusions of 3G and 4G services in India, using Bass, Gompertz, Logistic and Norton-Bass models that utilize a mix of linear and non-linear regression techniques. Additionally, we evaluate the influence of several exogenous variables on the diffusion of those MBSs in India. Our analyses reveal that, firstly in case of diffusion, Bass model estimates are quite sensitive to both 3G and 4G historical data, whereas Gompertz and Logistic models fit well with the same dataset. As expected, Norton-Bass model - encompassing all the successive generations of 2G, 3G and 4G - provides more reliable estimates of the diffusion parameters. Secondly, as far as 3G forecast is concerned, Bass model works better with fixed assumptions of ultimate market potential, whereas Gompertz and Logistic models seem to be more suited for ‘optimistic’ long-range forecasts and ‘conservative’ short-term forecasts, respectively. Our results also show that 4G is diffusing at 6.1 times the speed of 3G diffusion in India, when the total MBS subscription in India is likely to reach 410 million by 2026. Finally, we notice that, among the notable external sources of influence, National Telecom Policy 2012, average revenue per user, and aggregate income variables have significant positive impacts on the diffusion of MBSs in India.}

In this research, therefore, three main criteria, including jewelry-related, technology-related, and producer-related criteria, are initially determined, and seventeen sub-criteria are identified based on a review of relevant literature and experts~ opinions and knowledge. Then, four smart jewelry alternatives, including Bellabeat-Ivy Health Tracker, Totwoo We Bloom Smart Bracelet, Ringly Luxe Smart Bracelet, and Ringly Go Smart Bracelet, are chosen for analysis due to their technology and aesthetic design. Unlike prevailing studies, this study adopts the base-criterion method (BCM) and measurement of alternatives and ranking according to the compromise solution (MARCOS) with fuzzy ZE-numbers. The findings reveal that technology-related criteria are the most prioritized criteria by women. Further, activity tracking, price, and mobile alert are the first three critical sub-criteria in smart jewelry preference. Based on the overall evaluation, Ringly Luxe Smart Bracelet is the best smart jewelry for women. This research strongly contributes to extant literature as follows: (i) It provides a practical contribution to women in their smart jewelry selection processes and guides industrial practitioners, including smart jewelry designers and producers, in their design of smart jewelries that better satisfies the technological and aesthetic needs of women, and (ii) in terms of methodology, the proposed framework allows for the consideration of the degree of reliability of two different groups of decision-makers and experts for the decision-making process.}

On top, we examine the influence of two environmental contingencies – technological turbulence and competitive intensity – as potential influencers of these relationships. We collected and analyzed data of 139 Belgian firms through hierarchical regressions. Exploitation and exploration are positively associated with digital servitization, but exploration trumps the effect of exploitation when firms do both. Technological turbulence is positively associated with digitization regardless of the firm's level of exploration or exploitation, and competitive intensity only relates positively with servitization when firms emphasize exploration. Theoretically, we contribute to the literature by unravelling the relationship between firms' dynamic capabilities and their environment. In order to fully understand firms' strategic transition towards digital servitization, both should be considered. As managerial implications, we suggest that firms pay close attention to adapting their strategy to fit an increasingly changing environment.}

In particular, the work discusses the ecosystem as a valid unit of analysis for understanding such an unprecedented shaped-by-platform landscape. Then, it describes the growth strategies of the platform-based innovation ecosystem supporting the platform sponsor in mastering multipoint competition. Eventually, the study pinpoints crucial issues for policymakers in regulating the impact that platformization is having on society.}

abstract = {Supply chain network design (SCND) is a pillar of supply chain management (SCM). The modern industrial and market context, characterized by instability and dynamism, asks the supply chains and logistic networks to be designed from an integrated and reactive perspective, addressing multiple goals. Economic and environmental sustainability is the most explored target by the literature. Besides this goal, the recent mass customization paradigm, led by Industry 4.0, resulted in a significant growth of product variants, which cannot be managed by traditional production strategies, as Make-to-Stock (MTS), because of the high rising costs. Hence, stock minimization, which is one of the main pillars of the lean production philosophy, is a key competitive asset to consider in SCND. However, the current literature still lacks of integrated three-objective models simultaneously optimizing stock, economic and environmental issues in designing and managing modern supply chain networks. To fill this gap, this paper proposes and applies a mid-term three-objective linear programming optimization model to minimize, simultaneously, the stock level (lean waste), the environmental emissions (green waste), and the global supply chain network costs, getting the Pareto frontier and supporting the industrial practitioners and the logistic managers in the network design and management. A European instance exemplifies the model application getting stock, environmental and economic optima together with reasonable best-balance configurations. Among the Pareto points, the selected configuration allows reducing the stock level without a relevant increase of the environmental emissions (+1.62%) and of the supply chain network costs (+0.21%), respect to their single-objective optima.}

Nevertheless, even in the age of social commerce, and the communication affordances of social networking sites, consumers are not always informed regarding such benefits. As such, we examine how the characteristics of social commerce and organic foods can work in tandem to influence organic products purchase intentions. We develop a model based on the theory of consumption values and test it empirically. The results show that interactivity, recommendations, and feedback are important social commerce characteristics (affordances), while food safety and eco-friendliness are key organic food characteristics. Such social commerce and organic food characteristics interact and serve as inputs for functional value and emotional value assessments, which in turn, drive purchase intentions of organic foods via social commerce. The findings also show that functional value is more instrumental in this process; and that there is also a significant difference between males and females in the formation of purchase intention. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.}

Therefore, we establish two scenarios (non-information sharing; information sharing) in the reseller format model and the agency sales format model, respectively. Firstly, we derive the members’ equilibrium decisions and explore the online retail platform’s information sharing strategy. We find that the carbon emission reduction efficiency and sales format play important roles in information sharing strategy. Then, we examine the effects of information sharing strategy on carbon emission, consumer surplus, and social welfare. We find that sharing information is always beneficial to the environment, and may create more positive social value. Finally, we investigate sales format strategy and find that it depends on the carbon emission reduction cost.}

Additionally, this study explores the moderating role of perceived delegation of decision-making rights in shaping this relationship. Our empirical findings indicate a positive correlation between the intensity of perceived coopetition and the speed and quality of innovation among complementors. Moreover, the perception of delegated decision-making rights was found to attenuate the relationship between perceived coopetition intensity and innovation quality, while amplifying its correlation with innovation speed.

Rather, network platform business models via automobility-as-a-service are argued to be one mechanism by which the primacy of the car may be retained. In turn this has important implications for the durability of the automotive industry, and of the unsustainable aspects of platform business models.}

A recent Deep Transitions framework has provided a comprehensive theory of the co-evolutionary patterns of multiple socio-technical systems over the last 250 years. However, so far the framework has not been subjected to systematic empirical exploration. In this paper we address this gap by exploring the co-evolutionary model linking niche-level dynamics, transitions in single systems and ‘great surges of development’, as conceptualized by Schot and Kanger (2018) [1]. For this purpose, we conduct a case study on the historical evolution of mass production in the Transatlantic region from 1765 to 1972. Instead of focusing on dominant technologies or common practices the development of mass production is understood as the emergence of a meta-regime, i.e. a set of mutually aligned rules guiding production activities in multiple socio-technical systems. The results broadly confirm the overall model but also enable to extend the Deep Transitions framework by uncovering new mechanisms and patterns in the variation, diffusion and contestation of meta-regimes.}

During the last decade, AI has made major technological breakthroughs most recently in the space of generative AI. This development is enabled by an increase in computing power, a decrease in its price, and the emergence of ubiquitous computing, resulting in vast amounts of storable and processable data. However, the diffusion of AI depends on its legitimacy in society, whereby legitimacy is understood as the congruence between organizational activities and their cultural environment. This study aims at understanding the process whereby AI is being (de)legitimated across key industries and over time. To capture and trace the process of legitimation, we rely on media coverage as a form of societal discourse reflecting the legitimation process of AI. We find that the legitimation process gathers momentum in the mid-2010s and the legitimacy of AI increases over time. Furthermore, we identify four types of legitimacy discourse, which integrate sentiment, specific media frames, and appeals of persuasion. Uncovering the four types of legitimacy discourse, we aim at supporting organizations seeking to understand the legitimacy of specific AI applications and how these legitimacy judgments can shift.}

In order to support this evaluation process, several studies have proposed the application of artificial intelligence techniques combined with the performance metrics suggested by the SCOR® model (Supply Chain Operations Reference). However these propositions present some limitations. While the systems based on Mamdani fuzzy inference do not allow adaptation to the environment of use based on historical performance data, the systems based on artificial neural networks are not adequate to deal with imprecise data and qualitative metrics. In order to overcome these limitations, this paper presents a new approach to support SC performance evaluation based on the combination between the SCOR® metrics with an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS). In total, 56 candidate topologies were implemented and assessed using MATLAB. The random subsampling cross-validation method was applied to select the most appropriate topological parameters for each ANFIS model. The mean square error between the target values and the values estimated by each ANFIS model demonstrate its greater accuracy of prediction. In addition, results of the hypothesis tests based on paired samples indicate that the proposed ANFIS models are adequate to support SC performance evaluation. The proposed system can help managers to develop improvement actions plans based on the outcomes of the evaluation process. When compared to previous approaches, it presents advantages such as greater accuracy of prediction, learning ability based on historical data, suitability to support decision making under uncertainty, better interpretability of results, among others.}

However, surprisingly little attention has focused on how CE discourses interact with science, technology, and innovation (ST&I) actors. To address this gap, this research adopts the prism of socio-technical imaginaries to understand specific visions of circularity in science and innovation, exploring how competing imaginaries mobilize specific actors, institutions, and visions of a greener future. Our empirical material included archival documentation from the Norwegian government and funded research projects on CE. Our analysis identified two key tension points within these imaginaries: “International drivers versus regional and local transition arenas” and “Ecological modernization versus sectoral transformation.” We suggest that tensions are inherent in CE socio-technical imaginaries but are often silenced or minimized by institutional discourses on circularity. Our findings suggest that official CE policy programs tend to minimize or overtly ignore criticisms and contestation that are increasingly raised in academic circles. Our findings indicate the need for increased involvement of ST&I actors and other societal actors (such as NGOs and the private sector) in the CE policymaking process to avoid endless growth as an unexpected CE policy outcome.}

Three innovation concepts have been especially highlighted: Smart Manufacturing, the Industrial Internet and Industrie 4.0. In parallel, academics have employed these concepts in numerous ways to advance their work. Despite this broad interest, precise definition and delineation of the cyber-physical convergence research domain have received little attention. Also missing is systematic knowledge on the interactions of these concepts with research trajectories. This paper fills these gaps by operationalising a newly constructed definition of convergence, and delineating the associated research domain into five data-centric capabilities: Monitoring, Analytics, Modelling and Simulation, Transmission and Security. A bibliometric analysis of the domain is then performed for 2010–2019. There are three findings. First, Analytics and Security have assumed strategic positions within the domain, coinciding with a “strategic turn” in policy. Second, backed by concerted policy and funding efforts, growth in Chinese scientific output has outpaced key competitors, including the U.S. and Germany. Finally, the patterns of promoting their works in terms of the three concepts differ significantly amongst U.S.-, Germany- and China-based authors, which mirrors the different policy discourses prevalent in those countries.}

Firstly, we review the history of urban ecological management's development, including four stages, i.e., the germination, transitional, formative, and prosperity stage, and summarize the concepts related to eco-cities. Then, we present a comparative analysis of the typical urban ecological management models worldwide, with a focus on Singapore's garden city, Japan's zero-waste city, Britain's low-carbon city, Brazil's green state capital, Australia's eco-city, Finland's eco-city development projects, and the United States' comprehensive management. Three other typical models from Sweden, Germany, and Denmark are presented. The experiences and lessons from these urban ecological management models are further discussed. Finally, a new and comprehensive management framework is proposed, incorporating the five perspectives of urban planning, industrial transformation, organizational model, environmental protection, and institution system. The framework can provide a scientific basis for the refinement of urban ecological mangement. All the analysis and conclusions will contribute to the academic research and practical operations regarding low-carbon transformation and regional sustainable development.}

The results show that from the perspective of fund suppliers, micro-loan company lending is more uncertain than direct social lending. From the perspective of financing methods, the uncertainty of contract loans is greater than the uncertainty of credit loans and is rising year on year. From the perspective of the financing period, great uncertainties occur in short-term loans of one month and long-term loans of one year or more. These results provide empirical support for policy decisions to regulate micro-loan companies, establish the spirit of contract, and increase capital liquidity.}

abstract = {With the progress of epidemic containment, the Chinese government has relaxed its regulatory policies on street vending, hoping to help people who have lost their livelihoods and to assist in the restoration of social and economic order. In response, Chinese people poured into the stall economy, especially individual peddlers, with great expectations for street vending. Street vending has become a hot topic on Chinese social network sites (SNSs). Based on the push-pull-mooring framework, SNS information overload theory was introduced and combined with the actual situations of street vending in China, and a structural equation model was established to study factors affecting individual Chinese peddlers' intention to engage in street vending and the effects of SNS information overload on these factors. Results revealed that perceived policy benefits, subjective norms, and switching cost perceptions of individual peddlers were positive factors affecting their intention to engage in street vending. SNS information overload positively affected individual peddlers' dissatisfaction with their original business model, anxieties over their livings, perception of policy benefits, and subjective norms but negatively affected individual peddlers’ perception of switching costs.}

abstract = {Due to the pandemic, there has been an increase in the use of dietary supplements to boost the body's immune system. A demand–supply mismatch exists as a result of the unexpected increase in demand. The nutraceutical industry has been working on mechanisms to improve manufacturing efficiency and address bottlenecks in sourcing and production. The current study is attempting to address the issue of identifying these bottleneck problems by proposing a mathematical model to devise the optimal costs associated with the operations, as well as attempting to see the possibility of blockchain technology adoption as a better alternative to addressing these bottlenecks. The study compares adding an assembly line to existing infrastructure to implementing blockchain technology to improve manufacturing process efficiency. The study increases the likelihood of blockchain technology being used in the nutraceutical industry and calls for more research at the intersection of blockchain, nutraceuticals, and optimization.}

abstract = {University-industry collaboration now extends beyond traditional intermediary structures and logics, enabled by more contemporary virtual networks and digital formats. This however poses new strategic and operational challenges for effective and responsive knowledge transfer. The purpose of this paper is to compare traditional models of knowledge transfer intermediaries in university-industry collaboration with emerging, virtual (network-based) and digital intermediaries by exploring their structures (thus institutional logics) and their services (their agency). We synthesise literature to form a comprehensive analytical framework to assess the structure and agency of twenty international knowledge transfer intermediaries from around the world. Further running a cluster analysis using multiple correspondence analysis method and following its results we propose a unique combination of institutional logic and bounded rationality lenses, which allowed us to identify four types of knowledge transfer intermediaries: rigid, rigid-unbounded, agent-bounded and agile. Our unique framework contributes to existing knowledge focused on traditional forms of knowledge transfer intermediaries, by identifying and positing institutional logics for emerging contemporary virtual and digital intermediaries in university-industry collaboration.}

abstract = {This study scrutinises the mechanism between uncertainty factors and supply chain quality risk (SCQR), and to examine the moderating role of supply market thinness (SMT). Drawing on agency theory and resource dependency theory, a conceptual model for the SCQR is proposed. Based on the survey data obtained from 202 managers, we use the structural equation modelling method to test our conceptual model, and the multiple group method to conduct the moderating analysis. We find that the uncertainty factors are associated with managers' perceptions of the probability and magnitude of SCQR. Moderation analysis show that the impacts of technology uncertainty and traceability uncertainty on probability of SCQR, and the impacts of technology uncertainty, testability uncertainty and product complexity on magnitude of SCQR, are moderated by SMT. The validated model provides practitioners with the direction to scrutinise the nature of SCQR, in order to establish effective practical approaches to manage it.}
