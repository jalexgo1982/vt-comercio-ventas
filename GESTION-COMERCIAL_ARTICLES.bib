abstract = {Unlike the progressive growth of developed countries that have transitioned from large-scale tourism to intelligent tourism, China's tourism sector exhibits characteristics of short-term leapfrog strategic change. However, existing research lacks a sufficient theoretical explanation of how China's tourism industry can achieve this leapfrog strategic change. Based on a longitudinal case study, this study finds that digital supplementation and intelligent innovation constitute two key stages in Chinese enterprises' leap-forward strategic change from large-scale park tourism to intelligent tourism from 2012 to 2020. Digitalization is an important path for Chinese enterprises to realize transformation and upgrading, mainly through digital acceleration and reconstruction learning mechanisms, to drive the double leap in strategic change and tourism industry model innovation. In the context of a mismatch between digital technology and managerial skills, this study provides a theoretical model for firms to implement a leap-forward strategic change in intelligent tourism. It not only supports strategic change theory and organizational learning but also provides management illumination for digital rural construction, national tourism intelligence policy development, and enterprise intelligent tourism reform practice.}

We conducted an in-depth investigation of 10 SEs in Italy and the UK contextualized in the food and beer industries. We produced a theoretical framework shedding light on the possible strategies to deal with sources of conflict and applied a csQCA to identify the most effective combination of strategies in preventing mission drift: mixed ownership and financial resource mobilization. We discuss that differences between the countries emerged due to some of the paradoxes of SEs in these industries. This is seemingly the first study adopting a csQCA in such a context, and it proved to be suitable for studying social entrepreneurship in homogenizing variables, hardly comparable otherwise.}

abstract = {Forest ecosystems are notably influenced by: 1) the rate and spatial distribution of forest land development, and 2) how remaining undeveloped forest lands are managed. Regarding this second factor, economics and ecology research conducted in different locations in the U.S. suggests that increasing housing development can reduce the profitability of commercial timber production and thus the intensity with which landowners manage their forest lands. Some studies, however, suggest that in some locations these effects are not evident. We sought to consider what contextual factors might influence where and when development effects on forest management might become evident. We began with a critical review and synthesis of existing research addressing the degree to which housing development influences private forest management. We followed that with an empirical (logit) analysis of the likelihood of “active” (e.g., thinning) and extractive (e.g., harvesting) management on nonindustrial private forest lands in Oregon and Washington (U.S.), as a function of stand, site, and other factors, including nearby housing development. From our review and synthesis of previous research literature, we conclude that the varying results of previous studies likely owe to a combination of biophysical and socioeconomic contextual factors that influence both how prevalent development impacts might be in different locations and how easily they can be observed in empirical analyses. The results of our analysis of active and extractive management in Oregon and Washington are largely consistent with this finding, with some regions showing statistically significant negative effects owing to housing development, and other regions remaining largely unaffected. We conclude that policymakers and managers need to consider the biophysical and socioeconomic context of different study areas when evaluating the implications of individual study results.}

We observe, in particular, the region's position within Mather's well-known Forest Transition and what this suggests for the future of Latin American forest development and for the important effect of aggregate economic development on forest use, for agriculture's role in deforestation and policies to control it, and for the need for more information about the forest industry and its impact on forest-dependent human communities and on the forest itself. More or better information about each of these themes would lend confidence to our findings. More importantly, it would enable improved market and policy adjustments for the large changes that we anticipate both economic development and global climate change will bring to Latin America's forests and forest sector in the years ahead. Finally, we finish by noting the rapidly growing demands for non-consumptive uses of Latin America's forests and the importance of information about those as well.}

Using imaginization, this research examines practices of ethical leadership during a crisis, using The Walking Dead television series as a reference. The Walking Dead offers an artistic representation of different leadership styles, with business organizations likened to groups of survivors. Its post-apocalyptic setting offers something of an analogy to the COVID-19 crisis. Each firm’s struggle for survival in the face of external threats is paralleled with each community’s struggle to protect members’ lives, preserve resources, and pursue development. The practices of the leaders in the program are compared to those of the leaders of firms such as P&G, Boeing, GM, Renault-Nissan, IBM, BP, GE, Berkshire Hathaway, Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Ali Baba, Netflix, Airbnb, Uber, and SpaceX. This paper illustrates why ethical leadership goes far beyond charisma and competencies to involve deep motivations and sincere emotions and why it is accessible to everyone through a process of learning and transformation. The study shows the need to adapt leadership style to context. Good leaders know when to step back, meditate, and be lucid. They balance consultation and initiative. They do not fear other leaders and mentor new ones.}

In Canada, current forest policies and commercial management systems do not adequately protect and conserve these natural resources. Decisions makers have yet to fully and effectively use local and traditional knowledge in forest policy and planning. This research used a participatory approach and 26 community interviews to document local criteria, elements and critical local values surrounding NTFP development and conservation within the traditional territory of the Missanabie Cree First Nation. Applied ethnobotany and policy analysis were used to develop a locally specified framework and case study to guide decision making. The analysis establishes key community-based objectives to promote diverse socio-economic benefits, while advancing local forest management systems. In particular, the co-research process identified six criteria (1. productive capacity; 2. health; 3. conservation and protection; 4. long-term management benefits; 5. community participation; 6. capacity of institutions) and associated 18 elements and 239 critical local values, which span the maintenance and enhancement of NTFPs. The resulting framework represents one possible re-entry point into the forest planning process for Missanabie Cree who are working to reconnect with their land following a long period of forced exclusion. Moving forward, leadership can continue to revise this framework to accommodate changing needs, further engage their membership, and in doing so refine their roles in forest governance. The research process and framework documented here can inform other forest land managers looking to create more inclusive decision making processes and document local values.}

The proposed model modifies the set of constructs by adding trust, security, and perceived risk. The sample consist of 334 Bizum platform users who are mainly young people between 18 and 22 years old. Obtained data was analyzed by a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). The results show that the strongest predictor for adopting to use Bizum mobile payment platform is habit, with 75 % of acceptance of young online banking users. But habit and social influence factors show 82.5 % of intention of use among young users. In contrary, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, price-value, hedonic motivation, trust, security, and perceived risk do not influence the intention to use this platform. Banks, financial entities, as well as banking platform developers, can benefit from the results of this study by understanding the factors that influence users to use these platforms and consequently successfully implement them.}

One way to solve this challenge is to allocate resources to identifying and exploring new trends and opportunities emerging from the environment that may affect existing business models, and guide the development of new ones. As has been widely acknowledged, many incumbents fail at more radical business model innovation. Few studies have examined the role of cognition in this context. We suggest that differences in strategic issue identification and interpretation can help to explain the cognitive barriers that emerge when incumbent firms try to engage with radical business model innovation. We propose and test a Delphi-based method to elicit and examine differences in the perception of industry trends, comparing innovators, core business employees, and external experts, in the context of a leading Nordic insurance firm. We find considerable disagreement between members of the innovation department and the core business, in this firm. We suggest this helps explain why internal innovators find it challenging to “sell” radically new business models to the core business. More generally, we contribute to the growing literature on business model innovation in incumbent firms.}

Data came from seven permanent sample plots of 1 ha each, installed in 1999 and monitored annually for 14 years. Mortality and recruitment, as well as gain and loss rates of basal area, were obtained for the plots, which represent distinct structural features of the remnants. The data indicated that there is not equilibrium among the rates of mortality and recruitment. In general the rate of recruitment was significantly higher than the rate of mortality. From the seven studied plots only two of them had higher rates of mortality than recruitment. The density of the plots had a direct influence on mortality and an inverse influence on recruitment.}

abstract = {The continuing destruction of the Amazonian forest, the largest remaining tropical forest ecosystem, has massive social and environmental consequences for local populations, but also for the climate, global food security and biodiversity. With some 20% of the forest already lost and the Amazon region likely approaching a tipping point, the conservation of its forests is a burning issue. High expectations are vested in the sustainable use of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) as a means to reconcile conservation and development. Accordingly, hundreds of initiatives have been launched over the decades that rely on NTFPs. With the proliferation of the bioeconomy discourse in recent years, they have received a new impetus. But are these expectations justified and backed-up by facts? Based on a systematic literature review, this article assesses the state of knowledge on NTFPs as a basis for sustainable local development in the Brazilian Amazon. The analysis reveals that while the number of studies has been growing continuously, the knowledge base is rather patchy. Coverage is limited mostly to a few NTFPs with high commercial value. The literature mostly attests positive effects of NTFP use on forest conservation and contributions to meeting socio-cultural needs of local communities. By contrast, existing studies identify limitations in terms of local income generation and suggest to combine the use of NTFPs with the commercial management for timber and the sale of environmental services. In terms of biodiversity conservation, some studies also point to risks of initiatives that emphasize income generation and stress the importance of diversifying production. It is worrying, that empirical knowledge on the effects of such combined and diversified approaches is scarce. A research agenda is crucial to support the successful promotion of NTFP-based value chains in the Brazilian Amazon. This agenda should include a comprehensive analytical framework that enables robust evaluations of past and future interventions. A better understanding of the actual impacts of such initiatives is vital as evidence for proof of concept and for deploying them at scale.}

To test the proposed conceptual model an analysis was undertaken of data from 370 personal interviews with online social community users.

Spatial conservation prioritisation (SCP) can be regarded as a useful tool for this challenge. We produced high-resolution, national scale SCP analyses to identify unprotected forest areas that host valuable forest biodiversity. We used stand-based modelled dead wood potential (DWP) data as a primary surrogate for conservation value. In addition, data on forestry operations that have negative impacts on biodiversity, connectivity between forest areas, the observations of red-listed forest species, connectivity to forest habitats of special importance for biodiversity, and connectivity to permanent protected areas were included in the analyses. Analyses addressed the estimation of present value and that of future potential following increases in connectivity. The results show that there are high conservation priority forest areas all over Finland although their distribution is highly fragmented. Depending on the version of the analyses, the best 10% of the landscape contains from 49% to 88% of the conservation values, a significant portion of which lie outside the current protected area network. Consequently, as biodiversity continues to decline in Finland and as most of the Finnish forest area is under commercial management, the current protected area network cannot be expected to halt the ongoing decline of forest biodiversity. Therefore, these analyses provide much-needed information for decision-making. They are a pragmatic tool for the planning of forest conservation networks and commercial management of forests at regional and national scales.}

abstract = {Within the context of the circular economy, this article analyses how supermarkets can reduce food waste by implementing appropriate marketing strategies underpinned by digital technologies, such as Big Data predictive analytics. Little is currently known of the potential role of the emerging digital technologies in furthering the sustainability of supermarket chains in emerging economies. Thus, an original multiple case study has been conducted, involving six supermarket chains operating in Brazil and six farming distributors that produce fruit and vegetables (F&V). The findings show that actions towards food waste reduction based on the principles of the circular economy begin with an understanding of F&V stages of deterioration. Through such an understanding, a number of actions can be undertaken to reduce the negative effects of this deterioration. These include (among others) the management of prices, sales, operations, and purchases, all of which can be underpinned by such technologies as sensors and augmented reality in order to manage dynamic pricing, storage, and item display. The findings contribute to demonstrating how digital technologies can help supermarkets’ marketing departments in driving corporate sustainability while also benefiting both consumers and societal well-being.}

abstract = {The Atlantic Forest of the southern Brazilian highlands is a biocultural mosaic of Araucaria Forest and grasslands. Despite adverse impacts on biodiversity, extensive areas are being afforested with non-native pine (Pinus spp.), triggering forest succession on areas that were previously native grasslands. The long-term effects of afforestation with these non-native trees for biodiversity conservation are still unknown. Here, we assess this issue by comparing the fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages in young (20 year) and old (70 year) pine plots with nearby native Araucaria Forest. Abundance and richness of butterflies were positively correlated with temperature and mean humidity only in the native forest. Abiotic conditions differed between vegetation types: there was more sunlight, and was warmer and drier in the pine afforestation plots than in the Araucaria Forest. Butterfly species composition was similar between young and old pine plots, but distinct from the native Araucaria Forest. Butterfly species abundances in native forests were more evenly distributed than in afforestation sites. In these pine sites, assemblages were dominated by small, grass-feeding satyrines, whereas old pine sites had more liana-feeding biblidines, and the Araucaria Forest had more large-sized bamboo-feeding species. Our results indicate that even after 70 years of succession a non-native pine afforestation cannot support a butterfly assemblage as that found in the neighboring preserved forest. Moreover, threatened grassland specialist species have been locally extinct after only 20 years of pine afforestation. The evidence gathered here points against the use of silviculture with non-native trees in these biocultural mosaic landscapes.}

We developed a participatory multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to prioritise 141 fished stocks in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, based on their importance to fisheries management. The approach aimed to: (1) structure the decision problem, (2) force consideration of management objectives at the stock level, (3) balance trade-offs generated by competing objectives, and (4) balance differences in the perceived importance of objectives among fisheries managers. Performance scores and criteria weightings for ten management objectives were elicited from two groups of managers (commercial and recreational), combined into a total performance value for each stock, and ordered to infer priority for assessment. Stocks with higher total performance values typically had an exploitation status of Overfished, Growth-overfished, or Uncertain and were subject to a catch quota, because these criteria were weighted highly by both management groups. However, total performance was more sensitive to differences in weightings between management groups than to variations in relative magnitude of weightings among criteria. The priority list of stocks will assist decisions regarding the optimal allocation of resources for fisheries research in NSW. This MCDA approach is adaptive and can incorporate changes in management priorities through time and additional ecosystem components.}

abstract = {This study investigated the extent to which intensive forest management practices influence a widespread bird of conservation concern, the Woodlark Lullula arborea. We compared trends of the studied population in Notec Forest, Poland during 2010–2014 against country-wide monitoring data, and populations of the forest interior versus forest edge dominated landscapes (forest-agricultural area mosaic). We also studied the influences of forest management practice (clearing size, stand structure, forestry activities on restock sites, harvesting in the neighboring habitat, and retaining tree aggregates) on the population of this species. Changes in woodlark numbers, habitat availability, and quality differences among studied sites and years were assessed using ANOVA. The influence of habitat characteristics on woodlark occupancy and abundances were tested by Generalized Estimation Equations, while the magnitude of influences in the study years was compared by Random Forest algorithm (as were population trends). Over the four study years, 419 woodlark pairs occupied 336 patches, with a maximum of 127 pairs. The number of woodlark pairs fell by 40% on the studied areas over the period, in line with declines across Poland as a whole. In our study system, population trends did not differ between forest and forest- agro mosaic landscapes. Size, age and number of available habitats did not differ either temporally or spatially during the study. Retention of unfelled trees in clearfell areas and forest works in the nearby sites, however, showed slight differences among the sampling polygons. Larger habitat patch size and restock areas under five years favored woodlarks. Less important but still significant positive influences were a higher proportion of retained trees and elongated shape of the habitat patches. Forestry activities on the neighbor stands were correlated with increased woodlark abundances, which is an unexpected result. Moreover, forestry provides suitable habitats for woodlarks in a dynamically changing arrangement. The magnitude of the studied factors’ influences on woodlarks showed a very high difference between study years, with the highest values in the years where woodlarks are the most numerous. In conclusion, we found no evidence that contemporary forestry adversely affects Woodlark habitat occupancy. Our study suggests that while managing land for one ecosystem service (timber), an apparent dis-benefit (loss of recreational attractiveness) might benefit some semi-open habitat species.}

The main conclusions were that the students with the intention of achieving a higher level of entrepreneurial skills were enroled in the Executive Master of Business Administration (EMBA) programme without omitting other master's degree programmes also chosen by students with entrepreneurial concerns. It was also found that the variable with the highest impact on entrepreneurial motivation was family environment. Our data lead us to maintain that these students were not always going to start up a new business. The originality of this paper comes from our survey with 1,135 responses from the master's degree programmes taught in five cities in Spain with the inclusion of an analysis for LATAM students.}

The fishery for this resource is artisanal in character and operates under a free access regime. However, in response to increasing market demand extractive activity has expanded from the collection of dead plants to direct extraction. This resource has biologically-based management plans that include effort regulations and annual extraction quotas. However, the algal population has suffered strong fishing pressure, complicating the governance of this activity. This study assessed the fishery dynamics of the algal resource L. nigrescens complex in northern Chile over the last decade by means of the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) conceptual framework. The results showed that the fishery dynamics were affected by high international demand, which has promoted the fishing effort (pressure) in response to economic and social factors (driving forces). This scenario presents problems for the fishery due to a tendency towards resource overexploitation, negative effects on the state of benthic ecosystems, and negative economic “impacts” that occur as a result of reduced fishers' revenues, social conflict and ineffective fishery governance. The assessment of the fishery management of the algae L. nigrescens through the DPSIR framework in the coastal area of the Atacama Region allowed us to identify the main components that explain the trend towards the deterioration of this fishery over the last decade.}

In this last perspective, sustainable project management, the project manager has a central and influential position. However, many factors or circumstances influence the behavior of the project manager with regards to addressing sustainability in his or her project? The study reported in this paper explored the variety factors that stimulate the project manager to address sustainability issues in the project he or she is managing. Based on the factors provided by the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPA), the study used Q-methodology to explore different subjective patterns of stimulus project managers experience. Based on the factor analysis of 49 Q-sorts, we discovered three factors in the stimulation of sustainable project management behavior. These three factors, that represent distinct stimulus patterns, were labeled as “Pragmatic”, “Intrinsically motivated” and “Task driven”. By identifying three distinct patterns of what stimulates project managers to address sustainability issues, the study contributes to a successful implementation of sustainable project management as a new ‘school of thought’ in project management.}

To what extent is it possible to optimize over time the resources allocated to positioning a brand on search engines? Often keyword costs are understood as monetary costs and the literature on keyword auctions suggests convergence towards a long-run equilibrium expenditure path. However, search engine optimization techniques, associated with implicit costs, have mainly focused on the short run. This paper suggests drawing long-term inferences from estimated cost per click, as the economic cost of organic keywords.

Survey and objective data were obtained from 148 entrepreneurial teams in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai (China). Multigroup structural equation modelling was employed to examine several hypotheses. Our two findings are that entrepreneurial self-efficacy positively mediates the relationship between team heterogeneity and opportunity recognition and that there are significant differences between the post-1980 and post-1990 generations. These findings explain the type of entrepreneurial teams young entrepreneurs should choose and how they can continue to cultivate their talent.

Subsequently, researchers evaluated its use. The experiment has been conducted through the introduction of two simulators, Gestionet, in the undergraduate classroom, and Global Management Challenge (GMC), in the master's degree classroom. Triangulation is included, gathering various data from students and firms. A 52-item survey was developed and tested statistically. Neural networks and fuzzy set-approaches were used to analyze students’ responses and understand how the activity stimulates students’ motivation (both intrinsic and extrinsic). Simulators offer multi-layered learning experiences to students and produce soft skills, such as strategic capacity, decision-making, and data analysis, and knowledge from their interactions with others and from their reflections on their actions and outcomes. These results are aligned with the competencies demanded by companies according to an analysis of the Report of the Association for the Progress of Management. This makes the simulator a great opportunity and a very useful tool for all the agents of the educational ecosystem.}
