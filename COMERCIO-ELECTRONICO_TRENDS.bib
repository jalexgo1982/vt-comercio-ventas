abstract = {Live streaming user-generated video (UGV), a nascent format of crowdsourced content, has grown massive popularity among social media users and is believed to have substantial potential business influences. However, industry practitioners express concerns regarding this new form on social media platforms and the influences of live streaming UGV consumption lack research. Motivated such, through a uniquely merged dataset from the video game industry, we conduct a series of panel time-series empirical analyses to investigate the business value of live streaming UGV consumption. Further, we propose a conceptual framework based on the sense of community literature to understand the consequences of live streaming UGV consumption and verify it through several online experiments. This research contributes to the IS literature by shedding light on the influences of emergent crowdsourced content, providing a conceptual framework to existing literature, and offering rich managerial implications and guidelines to managers regarding utilizing live streaming UGVs.}

abstract = {When talking about digital transformation, data sovereignty considerations and data transfers cannot be excluded from the discussion, given the considerable likelihood that digital technologies deployed along the process collect, process and transfer (personal) data in multiple jurisdictions. An increasing number of nations, especially those within the BRICS grouping (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are developing their data governance and digital transformation approaches based on data sovereignty considerations, deeming specific types of data as key strategic and economic resources, which deserve particular protection and that must be leveraged for national development. From this perspective, this paper will try to shed light on how data sovereignty and data transfers interplay in the context of digital transformations. Particularly, we will consider the various dimensions that compose the concept of data sovereignty and will utilise a range of examples from the BRICS grouping to back some of the key considerations developed with empirical evidence. We define data sovereignty as the capacity to understand how and why (personal) data are processed and by whom, develop data processing capabilities, and effectively regulate data processing, thus retaining self-determination and control. We have chosen the BRICS grouping for three reasons. First, research on the grouping's data policies and digital transformation is still minimal despite their leading role. Second, BRICS account for over 40 % of the global population, or 3.2 billion people (which can be seen as 3.2 billion “data subjects” or data producers, depending on perspective, thus making them key players in data governance and digital transformation. Third, the BRICS members have realised that digital transformation is essential for the future of their economies and societies and have shaped specific data governance visions which must be considered by other countries, especially from the global majority, to understand why data governance is instrumental to foster thriving digital environments.}

abstract = {Live streaming commerce has experienced rapid development in the past several years. One of the prominent advantages of live streaming is that streamers can stimulate impulse buying. However, impulse buyers may return the product when they calm down, leading to a high loss for the retailer. In this research, considering impulse buying and product returns, we explore the retailer's channel strategy within three channel structures: single traditional channel, single live streaming channel, and dual channel. We find that dual channel strategy dominates single live streaming channel strategy, and adopting live streaming may not always benefit the retailer. When there is a large proportion of impulsive customers and the product has a low marginal loss of return, it is better to adopt the dual channel strategy. Interestingly, the retailer will be more inclined to add a live streaming channel when there are more loyal consumers in the traditional channel. Moreover, considering the influence of product returns will make the retailer less likely to adopt live streaming e-commerce. Additionally, our analysis shows that consumer returns will significantly affect live streaming price. Under the single live streaming channel strategy, as the streamer possesses superior sales ability or there are more impulsive consumers, it is better to reduce the price. If the retailer neglects product returns, he will raise the price. Under the dual channel strategy, the retailer considering product returns will announce a low price in the live streaming channel and a high price in the traditional channel. However, if the retailer neglects product returns, he will announce a high price in the live streaming channel and a low price in the traditional channel.}

This paper investigates the strategies for adopting recommender systems by online retailers, introducing a theoretical model to assess whether both incumbent and new entrant retailers should adopt these systems. The model conducts a comparative analysis, factoring in consumers’ search costs and the strategic choices of competitors. It establishes equilibrium outcomes for four distinct scenarios, followed by an analysis of the interplay between the strategy selection decisions of the two types of retailers. The results show that if one retailer does not adopt the system, the other retailer should always adopt it. However, when one retailer has already implemented the system, the other retailer should only do so if the search cost is relatively low and the recommendation cost is high, but not when the search cost is moderate. Given two retailers’ strategies, we identify the requirements that form two equilibriums: both retailers adopting the system, or only the incumbent retailer adopting it. Furthermore, the recommendation levels and product prices are not necessarily in a monotonic relationship with the cost of the system.}

On one hand, internationalization allows retailers to access a wider range of markets, and on the other, digital channel expansion enhances customer reach and convenience within international markets. More specifically, we examine the relationship between retailer internationalization and performance (I-P relationship), and how this relationship is contingent upon the idiosyncrasies of retail sectors (i.e., grocery vs. non-grocery), digitalization, and their combined effects. Building on the liability of foreignness perspective, we first argue that the I-P relationship is U-shaped, because internationalizing retailers initially incur greater costs in their international expansion owing to their unfamiliarity with foreign markets, but as their foreign presence increases, they benefit from greater market power, experience, and scale economies. Then, we contend that as grocers suffer from higher levels of liability of foreignness due to increased requirements for host country embeddedness, non-grocers benefit more from internationalization with any gains and losses further amplified by digitalization. Hypotheses are tested against a panel of the 234 largest international retailers in the world over a 21-year period (1997–2017) and findings support the conjectures.}

Drawing on the theory of perceived behavioral control, this study contributes to the literature by proposing a theoretical framework that links the pre-purchase search channel (i.e., social commerce vs traditional e-commerce) to purchase quantity. To test hypotheses, we utilize a large sample consisting of 279,098 pre-purchase click events of 6,721 products purchased by 247,069 consumers in March 2018. The empirical results suggest that purchase quantity is lower when a consumer searches through a social commerce channel compared to a traditional e-commerce channel. We also examine the moderation effects of the characteristics of consumers and products. To show the generalizability of our main finding, we further conduct qualitative interviews with 20 participants from 12 countries. Our conclusions provide practitioners with critical managerial implications.}

This is in line with the global trends and literature from other major metropolitan cities in the developed world.

With fundamental societal marketing theory at heart, trust and engagement toward the seller and the consumer-to-consumer online secondary market platforms are hypothesized to mediate consumers’ perceived econ-centric functional value and their re-use intentions of the platform. The results show that all serial mediations (trust and engagement) are significant when the trust is directed toward the company that facilitates the platform, but not all serial mediations were significant when the trust is toward the seller.

This article proposes a new paradigm to deal with industrial and societal challenges, developing an auction-enabled collaborative routing mechanism for omnichannel on-demand logistics in a real-time transshipment network. We consider an online service platform for real-time management of on-demand pickup and delivery tasks, where multiple freight shippers can trade with multiple freight carriers. Freight shippers are retailers or individual customers, while freight carriers are a group of logistics service providers. The platform acts as the auctioneer. A two-stage combinational auction mechanism is designed for dynamic on-demand task (re)allocation. Tactical-level auctioning and operational-level routing decisions are optimized together. The transshipment-based task generation method is used to identify uneconomic paths from carrier’s real-time network for outsourcing. A transshipment-based routing algorithm is developed to enable each carrier to make decentralized decisions for network reconstruction and transportation bidding. Our model aims to improve the overall social welfare while bringing benefits to stakeholders involved. The computational results have shown positive society impacts. Specifically, shippers’ payments can be saved while carriers’ profits are increased compared with other operative models which have been investigated in previous research studies or industry. In addition, a substantial reduction in CO2 emissions and vehicles required can be achieved. The main reason for the improvement in social welfare is due to the optimal network achieved through collaboration. We also numerically analyze the impacts of three key factors: growth in demand density, urgency of tasks and flexible auction interval.}

Due to the large amount of online transaction, it is needed to have a strong security mechanism to protect the users from the internet hackers and scam. Hence, in this research, the security mechanism from users’ perspective will be studied. The most used security constructs such as Transaction Procedure, Technical Protection, Security Statements, Perceived Security and Perceived Trust are studied to identify the difference in the extent of the electronic payment system (EPS) used in Lazada between Malaysian and Thai users. Quantitative research method is applied with total of 250 samples collected from Malaysian and Thai users. The collected data is analysed through SPSS with Pearson Correlation Analysis to determine the hypothesis. The results of the data analysis indicate that Malaysians and Thais have different perceptions of the security mechanisms on Lazada, with Malaysians placing greater emphasis on Security Statements and Technical Protection and Thais on Security Statements and Perceived Trust.

abstract = {Nowadays, Digital Transformation represents one of the most important and promising challenges for the modernization of Small, Medium and Large Enterprises. The adoption of the correct technologies (and solutions) offered by the Digital Transformation process can literally represent the success key to interpret the modern and dynamic global market context and adapt to its rapid changes. Aware of this critical path, the present study aims to analyze the approach to Digital Transformation of different type of enterprises and, as preliminary research, it proposes a methodology which has been tested for three Italian corporates. The four pillars of Digital Transformation (IT uplift, Digitizing operations, Digital Marketing and New Ventures) are firstly introduced and discussed. They are the main object of the survey that has been administered to the three Italian companies to understand the relevant steps that can be applied in order to achieve a successful Digital Transformation. The results highlight the relevance of sensing and learning capabilities as triggers of digital transformation, moreover a fifth pillar should be added: training. It is our intention that this article will spark and encourage continued debate and discussion around these topics.}

This paper examines MS-SQ within a conceptual model of customer satisfaction and loyalty surveying UK customers who bought fashion clothing via their mobile devices. The results of two empirical studies confirm four dimensions of MS-SQ: efficiency, fulfilment, responsiveness and contact. Using bootstrapping of 2000 resamples, SEM results showed a significant impact of MS-SQ on customer satisfaction, which in turn impacts loyalty. These results are robust across two samples. Only the dimension efficiency exhibits an indirect effect on loyalty via satisfaction in both studies whilst controlling for gender, age, income, value of clothing item, and m-shopping experience. These findings are discussed and have managerial implications for retailers operating m-commerce sites.}

Despite Industry 4.0 transforming manufacturing in terms of the way of producing and distributing goods by means of process digitization, the offline retail SMEs market is struggling to satisfy customers’ shopping expectations due to two direct constraints: existing offline competitors operating under a narrowing market share, and online retail competitors increasing market share due to their better positioned eCommerce IT platforms. The purpose of this work is to study the potential effect of digitalization on SMEs, focusing on businesses operating in the offline retail market, by means of provisioning cloud solutions supporting the business digitization process. The study is based on data collected from a wide range of official sources in conjunction with extensive research work reviewing technologies applicable to these kinds of businesses. The validation is performed through the Focus Group methodology between the months of June to October 2019, with 20 participants from the Henares Corridor, Madrid (Spain) area, considering them as a relevant sample of offline retail SMEs in Spain. The value proposition of this study can help offline retail SMEs understand the difference between digitization and digitalization, the necessity of digitalization in their businesses, the existence of accelerators such as e-Receipt cloud solutions, and the disruptive potential of digitalization to their business models on long-term survival regarding competitors and raising the circular economy.}

The problem is to find a minimum cost tour over a set of customers and facilities in which the customer not visited on the tour is assigned to a feasible facility on the tour. The objective is to minimize the delivery and self-pick-up costs with the constraints of conflicting time windows provided by customers. This work puts forward a mixed-integer linear programming model to formulate the problem and provides a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve the problem. Several valid inequalities are developed and separated to improve the convergence of the algorithm. Sets of instances are generated, and the number of available facilities, the coverage radius of self-pick-up service are varied, to assess the effectiveness of the proposed formulations and algorithm. Experimental results show that instances involving up to 150 vertices can be solved optimally within one hour.}

Markov chains and neural networks are the most adopted models in previous studies, but few integrated user sequential order information and user numeric rating feedback. To simultaneously capture the time-aware demands and time-invariant interests of e-commerce customers, this study proposes a unique heterogeneous graph structure to model sequential buying order and rating feedback and develops a query-based recommendation approach to predict future purchase behavior. Experiments on four different datasets show that the approach demonstrates improved performance for different metrics.}

Utilizing the diverse sample of 241 US-based TBNVs, we comparatively analyze the relationship between companies’ evolution curves represented by search activity on the one hand and by valuations achieved through rounds of venture investments on another. The results suggest that TBNV's growth dynamics are positively and strongly correlated with its web search traffic across the sample. This correlation is more robust when a company is a) more successful (in terms of valuation achieved) – especially if it is a “unicorn”; b) consumer-oriented (i.e., b2c); and 3) develops products in the form of a digital platform. Further analysis based on fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) shows that for the most successful companies (“unicorns”) and consumer-oriented digital platforms (i.e., b2c digital platform companies) proposed approach may be extremely reliable, while for other high-growth TBNVs it is useful for analyzing their growth dynamics, albeit to a more limited degree. The proposed methodological approach opens a wide range of possibilities for analyzing, researching and predicting the growth of recently formed growth-oriented companies, in practice and academia.}

The return freight strategy adopted by platforms plays a crucial role in responding to consumer behaviors. To analyze how platforms determine the optimal return freight strategies, we examine a supply chain comprising a platform, a retailer, and heterogeneous consumers, employing a Stackelberg game model to capture their decision dynamics. Our findings suggest that the platform should opt for the PP strategy only when the product profit margin is relatively low. If the platform refuses to adopt the PP strategy, then the RP strategy is preferable when consumers face extremely high consumer return freight costs; otherwise, the CP strategy is the equilibrium result. We also prove that the selection of the return freight strategies leads to changes in the property of the equilibrium. Under the CP strategy, how the product fit probability affects the optimal price depends on the procurement cost; while under the RP and PP strategies, the optimal price decreases with the fit probability. Moreover, under the PP strategy, an increase in the product fit probability does not always benefit the platform. Further, our analysis reveals that, while the PP strategy can reduce the retailer’s risk, it might negatively impact supply chain performance, which implies that cost sharing in the supply chain does not necessarily lead to a higher channel profit. We also investigate how the platform’s return freight strategies affect consumer surplus and identify regions for Pareto improvement where all parties benefit from the PP strategy. Finally, by exploring extensions like positive salvage values, partial refunds, platform competition, and differentiated return freight costs, we confirm the robustness of our findings and unveil new insights.}

abstract = {In order to give businesses useful information, the main goal of this study is to forecast future consumer purchases in the sustainable jewelry sector. Companies launching new goods, services, or modifications to their current offers must anticipate client behaviours. Businesses can learn a lot about how current customers behave by studying their behaviour in order to develop marketing and sales techniques that work. The study uses a variety of statistical and machine learning methods to forecast the most important elements influencing the purchasing of sustainable jewelry in order to achieve this. These variables span a wide range of characteristics, including gender, age, educational attainment, occupation, gross monthly income, marital status, previous jewelry purchase history, purchase intention, preferred shopping locations, online purchase influencers, consumer buying patterns, preferences for branded and non-branded jewelry, and participation in sustainable jewelry practices. In this study, supervised classification algorithms such Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Decision Tree are compared over a wide range of machine learning approaches. To increase the predictive model's effectiveness and resilience, ensemble learning techniques including Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Bagging Classifiers are also introduced. A confusion matrix and classification report are the performance indicators used to assess these models. When used on a test dataset, these measures evaluate the model's precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 scores. These measurable metrics are essential for evaluating the models' reliability and efficacy. Notably, the study shows that the approaches of Random Forest, Decision Tree, Bagging Classifier, and Linear Discriminant Analysis continuously produce the highest accuracy rates, all of which stand at a remarkable 100% accuracy. Other used machine learning classifiers, such as Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, and AdaBoost algorithms, which provide significantly lower accuracy scores, fall short of this degree of accuracy. The Random Forest Classifier, which boasts a remarkable accuracy score of 100% for the training dataset and a reasonable 53% for the testing dataset, is particularly noteworthy. This classifier surpasses its competitors, demonstrating its potency in forecasting purchases of sustainable jewelry. In order to forecast sustainable jewelry purchases, this study uses a rigorous methodology that draws on a variety of statistical and machine learning models. The Random Forest Classifier is the most accurate and significant model for this predictive task, with Precision, Recall, and F1 scores of 100, according to the results, which were assessed using multiple performance measures like Precision, Recall, and F1 score.}

This research focused on leveraging weakly supervised learning to tackle aspect category learning and the sentiment classification of reviews. Our approach involves the generation of labels for both aspects and sentiments, employing the Snorkel framework of WSL, which incorporates aspect terms, review sentiment scores, and review ratings as sources of weak signals. This innovative strategy significantly reduces the laborious labeling efforts required for processing such extensive datasets. In this study, we deployed hybrid models, namely BiLSTM, CNN-BiLSTM, and CNN-LSTM, which harness multiple inputs, including review text, aspect terms, and ratings. Our proposed model employs two distinct loss functions: Binary Cross Entropy with Sigmoid Activation for Multi-Label Classification, enabling us to learn aspect Labels such as Quality, Usability, Service, Size, and Price, and Categorical Cross Entropy with Softmax Activations for Multi-Class Classification. Subsequently, we meticulously evaluate the performance metrics of these three implemented models, including Macro F1 score and Macro Precision. CNN & Bi-LSTM model attained 0.78 and 0.79 F1 scores on aspect and sentiment identification, respectively. The outcomes of this research are poised to make a substantial contribution to e-commerce platforms, offering an efficient and automated means to label and analyze vast troves of user reviews.}

Prior literature has identified the promising potential to help alleviate conventional business logistics' sustainability concerns, and researchers have advocated the need for extensive research for the future development of CL. However, the domain still lacks a developmental framework that explicitly studies factors affecting CL development and provides a roadmap for further growth. This study systematically reviews a portfolio of seventy-nine articles using the quantitative content analysis technique to identify the temporal trends in CL literature and collates lists of 11 barriers, 11 drivers, and 10 enablers to CL development. Following the systematic literature review, this study appraises the barriers, drivers, and enablers using content analysis and proposes a preliminary framework for CL development. At the theoretical level, we propose a developmental framework and supplement it with relevant recommendations for operationalization and testing, followed by several research questions to open avenues for future research. At a managerial level, our study helps practitioners with suggestions to adapt the proposed framework for CL businesses to foster sustainable CL systems.

Building on a unique data set covering all proximity-store openings in 60+ geographic markets in France by Carrefour, one of the world's largest big-box grocery retailers, the authors adopt an Empirics-First approach to investigate whether, and in what settings, opening proximity stores cannibalizes, or rather acts synergistically with, the retail chain's existing on- and off-line operations. In most markets, small box stores affect the parent store's market position. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in terms of both the channel that is affected (off- or online) and the direction of that impact (positive or negative). The authors identify several contingency factors that help explain this heterogeneity. Interestingly, some location factors that are commonly believed to nurture proximity store appeal turn out to be detrimental to the chain's overall on- and/or offline performance. Even though the authors reveal several novel insights and identify various contingency factors, numerous questions remain unanswered. To that extent, the authors conclude with a research agenda that may help shed insight in how to maintain and strengthen brick-and-mortar store relevance to convenience-seeking customers.}

Among emerging digital technologies, digital platforms are shaping and outgrowing the e-commerce channel representing a potential opportunity for manufacturing SMEs to embrace digital transformation. Drawing on affordance theory, this research uses a mixed method approach to investigate how manufacturing SMEs’ e-commerce commitment and digital platform adoption stimulate the actualization of three e-commerce affordances: consumer knowledge generation, internationalization, and customer diversification. Based on survey responses from 165 manufacturing SME managers, we find that direct selling through owned websites actualizes consumer knowledge generation and internationalization, indirect selling actualizes customer diversification and internationalization, and agency selling through third-party platforms actualizes all three affordances. The relationship between e-commerce commitment and ecommerce performance is mediated by consumer knowledge generation and internationalization but not by customer diversification. A fsQCA analysis outlines seven configurations actualizing these e-commerce affordances by pairing different ecommerce approaches with degrees of e-commerce commitment. Finally, an analysis of open-ended questions from 24 respondents complements the study and deeply interprets the seven unique configurations outlined.}

Some of the pertinent cybersecurity challenges of IoT devices in this regard relate to: (i) Security During Manufacturing, (ii) Identification and Authentication, (iii) Lack of Encryption, (iv) Large Attack Surface, (v) Security During Updates, (vi) Lack of User Awareness and (vii) Diverging Standards and Regulations. Against this background, the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) has been proposed to complement the existing EU cybersecurity framework consisting of legislations such as the Cybersecurity Act and the NIS2 Directive. However, does the CRA provide a framework for effectively combating the cybersecurity challenges of IoT devices in the EU? The central crux of the CRA is to lay down and enforce the rules required to ensure cybersecurity of ‘products with digital elements’, which includes IoT devices. To this end, several obligations are imposed on manufacturers, importers and distributors of IoT devices. Manufacturers are mandated to ensure that the essential cybersecurity requirements prescribed by the CRA are met before placing IoT devices in the market. While the cybersecurity requirements mandated by the CRA are commendable, the CRA suffers from several ambiguities which can hamper its potential impact. For instance, the CRA could provide guidance to manufacturers on how to conduct cybersecurity risk assessment and could clarify the meanings of terms such as “limit attack surfaces” and “without any known exploitable vulnerabilities”. When the fundamental themes of the CRA is analysed from the prism of the cybersecurity challenges of IoT devices, it becomes clear that the CRA does provide a foundation for effectively addressing the cybersecurity challenges of IoT devices. However, the expansive wording in various parts of the CRA, including in the Annex I Requirements, leaves scope for interpretation on several fronts. Consequently, the effectiveness of the CRA in tackling the Security During Manufacturing Challenge, Identification and Authentication Challenge, Large Attack Surface Challenge and Diverging Standards and Regulations Challenge would be largely contingent on how harmonised standards develop and how the industry adopts them. The CRA seems to be more effective, albeit not fully so, in significantly addressing the Lack of Encryption Challenge, Security During Updates Challenge and Lack of User Awareness Challenge of IoT devices. However, the manner in which the CRA addresses all these cybersecurity challenges could be improved upon if an agency such as the ENISA was given the legal mandate to set elaborate standards for cybersecurity requirements under the CRA.}

Companies and researchers typically favor and employ one of three methods to calculate the RR: based on the number of returned items, these items’ revenue, or their profit contribution. Interviews with 24 managers and industry experts reveal that two methods, item-based and revenue-based, are often used. However, little is known about how much the interpretation of RRs depends on the calculation method. In this article, the authors rely on extensive datasets to investigate these potential differences empirically. Analyzing more than 8 million transactions at sixteen different retailers, the authors find that RRs calculated via the three methods differ on average by 24.3%. The size of these differences makes cross-sectional comparisons of RRs calculated via different methods difficult. In contrast, the authors find that the developments of the RRs over time are similar, which allows for a meaningful time-series comparison of RR developments, regardless of the method. Finally, this research shows that all three calculation methods result in RRs that are equally insightful (leading) indicators of relevant retailer performance metrics.}

This paper contributes an analytical overview of why and how the new regulation is shaped by focusing on its legislative background, substantive rules and enforcement mechanisms. The influence of the GDPR in shaping this regulatory paradigm is scrutinized, with reference to pertinent concerns that could compromise the effectiveness of this paradigm in the Chinese context. The central edifice is that this landmark statutory instrument, broadly resembling the GDPR with certain variations, revamps the existing data protection regime in China. Nevertheless, as in its current form, the law fails to address several critical matters. The tentative conclusion is that the current construction of PIPA is necessary but far from sufficient. Alas, half a loaf is better than none.}

Reconfigurable process planning (RPP) reconstructs the optimal process planning for each batch according to different part batches based on commonality. In combination with the optimal crowdsourcing contracting (OCC) strategy, RPP helps release fixed capital and increase the flexibility of the enterprise under the requirement of diversified parts. The coupling of process planning and crowdsourcing contracting decisions is inherent in open manufacturing. This paper focuses on coordinated optimization underlying OCC with RPP. An OCC decision-making mechanism considering RPP based on Stackelberg game theory is established, which provides a solution for trade-offs between the RPP decision-maker and the OCC decision-maker. A coordinated optimization model is proposed to reveal the hierarchical relationships and is solved by a nesting genetic algorithm. A case study of a group of rotating shaft parts is taken to illustrate the effectiveness of the bilevel coordinated optimization (BCO) model. The results present that the commonality has an apparent impact on the OCC and RPP decisions in open manufacturing, and integrating it into process planning activities is advisable for platform enterprises to increase production efficiency and competitive advantages. Our proposed model can deal with the conflict and coordination between OCC and RPP and balances the benefits of platform enterprise with the optimal contractor impacts triggered by planning activities.}

Each pandemic requires the implementation of a series of restrictions and measures to reform local societies or even society on a global scale. Scientific and technological innovations have ensured the survival of mankind and consequently the establishment of new habits and trends. One of these reforms concerns the transport of goods and in particular urban logistics and last-mile delivery. Despite the increasing use of e-commerce, the average amount of money spent per month and per buyer has decreased; in times of uncertainty, people prefer to postpone big purchases and focus more on everyday products. These purchases have generated an increase in demand for the transport of goods and put significant pressure on the supply chain. For this reason, actions have been developed to improve logistics, in particular last-mile delivery, with the introduction of environmentally friendly and small vehicles, among others. In order to be able to trace the evolution of the combination of the COVID-19 pandemic and logistics spatially and temporally, the manuscript focused as a first step on the analysis of the literature entered in the main databases dedicated to scientific publications, returning some 2,227 indexed articles from 2000 to 2021. The search was conducted using keywords and iterations between them. The results emphasised the need to adapt business activities to the changing situation by anticipating people's needs, creating e-commerce sites capable of accompanying customers in this delicate phase. The results obtained were analysed from a statistical point of view, laying the foundations for future investigative steps in the field of last-mile logistics and the proper planning of loading and unloading spaces for goods in urban areas.}

This research paper presents a robust system that harnesses the Ethereum blockchain, IPFS (Interplanetary File System), and advanced cryptographic algorithms to create a secure, decentralized approach for tracking goods and preventing theft incidents. Unique identifiers and related information will be sent to the mail of the customer and same should entered by the customer for successful transaction. By assigning unique identifiers to purchased products and employing cryptographic techniques to encrypt sensitive data, our system ensures both user privacy and the creation of an immutable transaction ledger. Users can efficiently manage their purchased goods, block stolen items, and communicate with sellers through an intuitive interface. Additionally, the system provides sellers with a comprehensive transaction history, enhancing accountability and transparency within the supply chain. Through this research, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our blockchain based anti-theft measures, underpinned by Ethereum, IPFS, and cutting-edge cryptographic algorithms, in fostering secure, trustless transactions.

The advent of smartphones and other handheld devices has given rise to web users consulting websites with more than one device, or using a shared device. As a result, large volumes of seemingly disjoint data are available, which when analysed together can support decision-making. The task of identifying web sessions by linking such data back to a specific person, however, is hard. The idea of session stitching aims to overcome this by using machine learning inference to identify similar or identical users. Many such efforts use various demographic data or device-based features to train matching algorithms. However, often these variables are not available for every dataset or are recorded differently, making a streamlined setup difficult. Besides, they often result in vast feature spaces which are hard to use for actionable interpretation. In this paper, we present an alternative approach based on the fingerprinting of web pages visited by users in a single session. By learning behavioural patterns from these sequences of page visits, we obtain features that can be used for matching without requiring sensitive user-agent data such as IP, geo location, or device details as is common with other approaches. Using these sequential fingerprints does not rely on pre-defined features, but only requires the recording of web page visits, making our approach actionable. The approach is empirically tested on real-life web logs and compared with matching using regular user-agent features and state-of-the-art embedding techniques. Results in an ecommerce context show sequential features can still obtain strong performance with fewer features, facilitating decision-making on session stitching and inform subsequent related activities such as marketing or customer analysis.}

The review is epochal in the sense that there have been 3 major stages of innovation and diffusion in digital health that are identified. The year 1998 was deemed a significant starting point for the literature search because it marked the introduction of the term e-health. The main objective of this review is to track the evolution of digital health and the conspicuous developments in the field - crucial steps to get a grasp of the key issues involving the delivery of healthcare. The article includes a general discussion of these various key issues and sensitizing concepts. The sense-making thus shed some light on the areas of enquiry, which are central to identifying the direction in which the practice of healthcare is headed. These areas of enquiry often referred to as ‘substantive areas’ in qualitative research terminology, were identified as ‘electronic medical records’, ‘health cloud’, ‘data analytics’, ‘Internet-enabled devices’, and other ‘emerging information technologies’. The article concludes with a synthesis of key inferences drawn from the epochal review.

Although many studies have investigated consumers’ purchase decisions regarding sustainable products, little research has addressed SSCCs and the relationship between privacy, disclosure intentions, and purchase intentions in SSCCs. These relationships are important because the use of smart technology products requires large volumes of consumers’ personal information, which can lead to severe privacy issues when adopting SSCCs. Accordingly, consumers’ preferences for features of sustainable products could conflict with their privacy concerns when they disclose personal information. Thus, we investigate the relationship between the several benefits of SSCCs and privacy-related decisions when purchasing SSCCs. We propose an extended privacy trade-off model based on three critical assumptions: two types of privacy trade-offs, bidirectional privacy reduction, and anchoring effects. We also investigate the effects of government subsidies for purchasing SSCCs regarding the relationship between governments, companies, and consumers. To validate our model, we test the effects of interaction between privacy concerns and the benefits of SSCCs on disclosure intentions and purchase intentions. Our repeated tests for the various benefits of SSCCs demonstrate the robustness of the model. Our results indicate that when consumers consider purchasing SSCCs, sustainability plays the role of the common good in trading for privacy concerns. In addition, government subsidies to encourage companies’ sustainable products increase disclosure intentions and purchase intentions. We conclude that the status of sustainability as a common goal among governments, companies, and consumers represents an opportunity to balance the privacy tensions in the sale and purchase of SSCCs.}

A time-discretized multi-commodity network flow optimization model is proposed in an extended state-space-time network representation, where the time-dependent pickups and deliveries can be depicted by extending the state dimensions. By implementing an augmented Lagrangian relaxation technique, the VRPMBTW is reformulated as a quadratic 0–1 programming model, which is further decomposed into the standard least-cost-path sub-problems, and iteratively solved by dynamic programming in a block nonlinear Gauss-Seidel framework. The proposed approach is tested on the simple 9-node network and the real-world Chicago sketch network.}

We examine the ways in which privacy concern and confidence are (a) mediated through one's interest in sharing information with health professionals and (b) moderated by one's medical condition and the reliance on Internet. Evidence from this study provides insights into the factors shaping health-related engagement in information technologies, helping us argue that privacy is a key predictor. Discussion offers interpretations of how people's perceived need of medical data will mediate privacy concern, contextualizing the affordances of health technologies in future algorithmic applications.}

abstract = {Platformization has arrived in manufacturing. However, to enter the digital platform business manufacturers need to make a fundamental shift from product thinking to platform thinking. To master this shift, firms have to take the platformization pathway, which describes the process when manufacturers turn into digital platform providers. However, little is known about platformization on the firm level from a transformation perspective. Our study attempts to close this gap and develops a transformation model that frames the platformization pathway when established manufacturers become platform leaders. For this purpose, we adopt the concept of ambidexterity and develop a theoretical framework to conceptualize and investigate the transformation process as a result of sequential transitions and balancing between explorative and exploitative activities. Moreover, we use interviews from 29 large manufacturers and conduct an inductive case study analysis to identify the different stages, the contextual factors and the dynamics of transformation. By combining the theoretical framework and the results of our case study analysis, we develop a formal transformation model that contributes to understanding the manufacturers' platformization pathway. Our results also aim to support manufacturers in designing their strategies so they can turn into leading digital platform providers.}

abstract = {In online purchases, customers often exhibit considerable hesitations due to quality uncertainty and return freight fees. In response, online retailers may buy the return freight insurance (RFI) service from insurance companies that compensate the customers when they return the purchased item. With the RFI service, insurance companies generally verify the quality information posted by the retailer to avoid excessive customer returns. Thus, the RFI service not only reduces the customer’s return freight but also acts as an imperfect quality signal for customers to mitigate quality uncertainty. We characterize the RFI’s imperfect signaling effect by signal efficiency, and develop a game-theoretic model to investigate the RFI strategies of insurance companies and the retailer. Our results shed light on how signal efficiency and return freight fees drive their RFI strategies. The insurance companies charge an extremely small RFI premium for the retailer selling high-quality products; for the retailer selling low-quality products, the RFI premium becomes large for those with a medium return freight fee, or with a small signal efficiency. The retailer selling high-quality products always adopts the RFI service. The retailer selling low-quality products does not adopt the RFI service when the return freight fee is large. Given a medium return freight fee, the retailer with low-quality products prefers the RFI service when the signal efficiency is medium. Given a small return freight fee, only when the signal efficiency is large does the retailer with low-quality products adopt the RFI service. Our results provide new explanations for the prevalence of the RFI service for retailers selling products of different quality, and shed light on the RFI premium strategy for insurance companies.}

abstract = {Electronic commerce (EC) is becoming a popular platform for online retail shopping and online payment, and it has become a new phenomenon of business transactions and innovation. In view of EC importance in global business transactions, surprisingly, there is no proper and appropriate system of performance measurement. Even if an EC firm were to measure performance, typically, the focus is on financial results using the traditional accounting system (AS) of measurement. The aim of this paper is to identify the metrics and indicators needed for EC performance measurement as the AS is inappropriate for many of the EC activities such as traffic flow, reliability of security of online payments, use of social-media data, etc. We first use a systematic analysis of selected articles to help us identify, understand and select metrics and indicators that are applicable for EC performance measurement. The Delphi method is then undertaken to conduct a questionnaire survey to gauge consensus of experts’ opinions with respect to (wrt) the use of those metrics and indicators selected. We found the respondents largely agreed that the metrics and indicators proposed by us are necessary or very necessary for use in EC performance measurement, although the experts consider three of the metrics proposed − traffic sources, emails subscribers and customer lifetime value be replaced with three accounting indicators (net income, return on investment and break-even points). The data is robust as it is verified by statistical tests. This study has both academic and practical implications; for the former, the metrics and indicators proposed meet the theoretical mathematical measurement system, and for the latter, the metrics and indicators proposed allows operation and strategic managers to design and develop an organization’s PMS.}

A new technological mix of mobile-apps, big data, blockchain, AI, cloud computing and digital platforms is taking place with unprecedented speed and is forcing traditional banks to consider this technology to form part of new collaborative value creation networks, such as digital business ecosystems (DBEs). Traditional payment habits based on cash and credit or debit cards are being replaced by new innovative formats of mobile instant payment among end users (P2P). Through a single case study – Bizum's DBE – the purpose of this research is to explore how successful was the defensive strategy developed by traditional banking entities with the objective to lead the new mobile instant payment ecosystem in Spain. The findings show that Bizum's DBE is helping traditional banking entities to create a superior digital value that is being adopted very quickly by a huge number of users in Spain. The main contribution of this study is the complete explanation of how a winning strategy of creation and development of a DBE can: i) ensure survival of incumbents in the face of threats from digital disruptive actors, and ii) transform consumer habits very quickly, due to the superior created value as a new solution for that need. We used the novel reformulation of the Modularity Theory (Baldwin, 2020c) which can be considered as a first step for a DBE-specific theorisation and supportive framework to understand the deep social impact of the different network effects generated.}

Notably, the e-commerce industry is known for relying heavily on big data analytics, business intelligence, and other data-related technologies. Multiple semi-structured interviews with e-commerce professionals and consumers were conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of GDPR based on the strategies employed by e-commerce companies and the online user experience of customers in the Netherlands. The main findings show that while GDPR compliance incurred additional costs for companies, it also improved data security and increased customer trust. Furthermore, the results also suggest that GDPR affects the e-commerce analytics operations in organizations after its adoption. Thus, many organizations have altered their practices to achieve compliance with the laws. The findings of this research contribute to the ongoing exploration of the effects of GDPR on online retail businesses that utilize (big) data analytics.}

Therefore, it focuses on understanding the barriers to and enablers of IoT adoption in planting and harvesting vegetables. We built a theoretical framework that incorporates the constructs of individual and organizational technology adoption models, linking behavioral, technological, organizational, and environmental factors. The framework is supported by the technology-organization-environment (TOE) and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) models. We conducted in-depth interviews with 15 producers, three agricultural sector experts, and four suppliers. The results showed that only established producers implemented technology, indicating that organizational factors are decisive for the adoption of the IoT. Thus, the producer's size, knowledge, management level, and investment power affect IoT adoption. The theoretical model needs to be assessed according to producers' size, thereby revealing that organizational factors directly influence producers' behavioral issues.}

The platform enables the shift from the traditional manufacturing process, which is driven by research and marketing, toward a customer-centric product development process. However, a challenge arises as customers lack technical knowledge to communicate their product specifications effectively, creating a semantic gap. This paper proposes a soft prompt-based network structure that utilizes pretrained language models to bridge the semantic gap on the C2M platform. To address limited customer needs data and imbalanced classes, a large corpus of product review texts is used to establish a mapping between reviews and product specifications. A smaller set of customer needs text is then employed to adapt this mapping to the target customer needs-product specifications relationship, thereby closing the semantic gap. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model adaptation operation and the prompting structure. Additionally, the experiments highlight the robustness of the proposed method against variations in training data size, thereby mitigating the challenges posed by imbalanced classes. The proposed method could potentially bring innovation to product customization and C2M platform development. By bridging the semantic gap, companies can better integrate customers in the co-design process and effectively translate customer needs into actionable product specifications.}

To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a fake review detection model using aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) while considering the effects of product types. Using a dataset of Amazon reviews, our ABSA model revealed that two aspects are fundamental for detecting fake reviews and suggests the need to associate the two. These are the product category and the verified purchase attribute (with the greatest contribution observed for credence and experience product types).}

With pooled and fixed-effect panel data models, this paper examines which variables out of 22 independent variables are effective in enhancing apps adoption globally. Further, by interacting two dummy clusters, Initial and Maturity with determinant variables, the study identifies the differential policy effectiveness of each determinant factor on apps adoption. The paper concludes that the three stages of apps diffusion levels have their respective effective strategy choice sets: 11 for Initial stage, 12 for Fast-adoption stage, and 13 for Maturity stage, suggesting that countries should develop their mobile apps inclusiveness strategy tailored to their context of apps adoption.}

We use the hope-based (behavior-oriented) and game-based (technical-oriented) negotiation theories as the theory ground to explicate the logic of the agent's negotiation strategy. Upon which we propose a theoretical model of bilateral negotiation as the framework for designing the SLR model. We then propose the testable hypotheses to evaluate the utility of the proposed model against the benchmark results. We build a prototype system and empirically test the hypotheses using computer-to-computer (CtC) and human-to-computer (HtC) negotiation experiments. The empirical results show that the proposed system outperforms the benchmark system in both CtC and HtC negotiations regarding deal price and utility. The proposed model provides an automated negotiation solution for online platforms that can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their negotiation capability.}

To answer this question, the current study applied a bibliometric method, word co-occurrence (co-word) analysis, to identify core research themes and trends in the e-commerce field, based on 17,416 author-provided keywords collected from 3,284 academic articles published between 2001 and 2020 in seven major journals in e-commerce field. Specifically, the data were analyzed based on two periods: 2001–2010 and 2011–2020. We found that the research themes in the e-commerce field have evolved alongside technology’s development and diffusion. Some research themes, such as recommended system and eGovernment, have persisted as important research themes and studied continuously over the 20 years studied. Some research themes studied in 2001–2010, such as B2C and XML, disappeared in 2011–2020, whereas some new research topics, such as cloud computing, mobile technologies, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, emerged in recent years. This study provides a good understanding of e-commerce research’s evolution, as well as useful suggestions to direct future research by scholars in the e-commerce field.}

However, studies in developing contexts such as South Africa have yet to address adequately what contributes to repeated mobile shopping use (continuance intention). Using an integrative model that incorporates a hierarchical shopping values (hedonic and utilitarian) factor structure in the expectation-confirmation model, this study examines factors underlying mobile shopping continuance intention among South African shoppers. Survey data was obtained from 437 consumers who had conducted mobile shopping in the month leading up to the survey. Structural equation modelling was used to validate the research measurement model and to test the study's hypotheses. The findings suggest that the integrated proposed model provides a better explanation for mobile shopping continuance intention. Furthermore, usefulness, utilitarian value, and satisfaction significantly influence mobile shopping continuance intention. The tested integrated model provides a more detailed account of mobile shopping continuance intention, and could serve as the basis for future research on mobile shopping continuance intention.}

Many studies on forecasting links in social networks and on other networks have been conducted over the last decade. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on graph Laplacian eigenmaps for predicting the geographic location of nodes in complex networks. Our method utilizes the adjacency matrix of the network and generates a scoring matrix that captures the similarity between nodes in terms of their geographic location. By transforming the distance matrices into score matrices using exponential decay, we show that the method achieves consistently high performance across various real-world datasets, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments on real-world networks demonstrate that The LCG method proposed in this study exhibits consistently high performance across most of the evaluated datasets, with an average score of 0.95%, surpassing the other methods.}

abstract = {Modern day store brands (SB) or private labels (PL), now also popularly called private brands, are brands generally owned and marketed by retailers. They have been active on the market for about 70 years. Over this time span, these brands have evolved from generic, cheap, low-quality economy or budget private labels to lower-priced-than-national brand but acceptable-quality value or standard private labels. Over time, retailers extended the value proposition to the consumer segment seeking higher quality by offering premium private labels. This strategy, called the tiered-private label, comprises offering economy PL to the price-sensitive but not quality sensitive consumers, standard PL to mainstream consumers seeking acceptable quality at lower prices, and premium PL to the quality-sensitive segment seeking value. Over the last 40 years (1980–2020), these versions of private labels have witnessed substantial growth around the world, though the growth is said to be tapering in recent times. As retailers chart the future strategy for their private labels in 2020 and beyond, a pertinent question they face is: Should they continue to offer value or even tiered PL with the same formula that brought them success in the past, or should they morph and adopt new strategies in keeping with current market trends? We support adopting a new strategy that we call the smart PL strategy. The value PL strategy and its manifestation as the tiered PL strategy cater to different consumer segments but focus primarily on price and quality as attributes of choice. In the current marketplace, consumers care not only about price and quality, but also about sustainability, ethics, social responsibility, image, so forth, perhaps more so than earlier generations. They are also more tech-savvy in using digital tools for search and purchase. Retailers, on their part, are now endowed with rich, extensive data that they can tap into to understand customers’ diverse needs, and they are able to harness technology for developing the right product and communication. Thus, the smart PL strategy is a strategy by which retailers can leverage data and technology to market private labels that meet diverse customer needs and achieve greater retail differentiation, store loyalty, margins, and profits. This thought piece provides a road map for developing such a smart PL strategy and directions for future research.}

Our methodology involved searching for articles published in the last six years into four different literature databases. The search of articles employs a search string composed of the following keywords: purchase, buy, transactions, fraud prevention, fraud detection, e-commerce, web commerce, online store, real-time, and stream. We apply six filtering criteria to remove irrelevant articles. The methodology resulted in 64 articles, which we carefully analyzed to answer five research questions. Our contribution appears in the updated perception of fraud types, computational methods for fraud detection and prevention, as well as the employed domains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey on combining prevention and detection of e-commerce frauds, linking also architectural insights, artificial intelligence methods, and open challenges and gaps in the research area. The study main findings demonstrate that from 64 articles, only five focus on the fraud prevention problem, and credit card fraud is the most explored fraud type. In addition, current literature lacks studies that propose strategies for detecting fraudsters and automated bots in real-time.}

Businesses should not focus only on profit, but on all pillars of sustainable development to ensure the ethical, rational, and efficient execution of all business processes and activities. The paper aims to point out the integration of the concept of sustainable development into the strategy of courier companies. Increasing rates of urbanization and the continuous development of e-commerce are increasing the pressure on last-mile delivery in urban areas. With the increase in demand for home delivery, to parcel lockers or delivery points, the question arises of how to implement these processes efficiently and more sustainably.

In this paper, we propose the use of a Bayesian approach utilising the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) within its framework to estimate the risk ratios as well as probabilities of online patronage. To this end, we used publicly available data (such as household access to broadband connection, population figures and business location data) in combination with online transaction data from a focal retailer to estimate and identify which locations (i.e., postcodes) have the highest probabilities of patronage from online customers of the retailer. The three covariates adjusted for were presence of a competitor, average income at the postcode level and internet access at the postcode level; of these, internet access was found to be the most significant influencing factor on online patronage of the retailer. Overall, the resultant spatial maps provide useful predictions of how the estimated risk ratios and exceedance probabilities vary across the geographic market and the implication on opening a new offline outlet and targeting customers are discussed.}

We argue that controversy is an important boundary condition for predicting how aggregated ratings and review valences impact user behavior and product outcomes. Using cognitive dissonance theory, particularly research on predecisional distortion and the blemishing effect, we develop and test three hypotheses that examine whether average-rated products that are a result of consensus elicit different consumer behaviors and product outcomes than average-rated controversial products (i.e., products with polarized ratings). Utilizing four years of real-world rating, commenting, and purchasing behaviors pertaining to over 60 thousand designs and two thousand products from a creative crowdsourcing ecommerce site, we find that negative information mixed with positive feedback can produce net positive results. Products which receive more polarized premarket feedback generate more community discussion, community sales, and follow-through purchases. The findings suggest that, in situations where consumers have a developing preference for an item, encountering comparatively negative information can in fact have a positive impact on commenting and purchasing behaviors—more so than if no opposing information were present.}

The Long short-term memory neural network (LSTM), a deep learning variant, has huge potential in forecasting the forthcoming values of given patterns using historical time series data. Lately, the forecasting task has captivated the focus of researchers in deep learning areas to handle the constraints of traditional statistical approaches. Owing to the dire need for accurate forecasting and also due to technological advancements, the collection of time series data has become more accessible, and this has paved the way for deep forecasting models. In this paper, we propose the Stacked Bi-LSTM (SBiLSTM) architecture, an adaptation of the traditional deep long-short term memory (TDLM). The approach is evaluated using two oilfield production time series. The performance of the proposed SBiLSTM model is compared with the recurrent neural network-RNNs, multi-layer RNNs, deep gated recurrent unit (DGRU), and deep long-short term memory (DLSTM). Using different measurement criteria, the empirical results show that the proposed DLSTM model outperforms other standard approaches. It is observed that the proposed SBiLSTM model acquires long and short-range interdependent features of univariate time series data without the large memory requirement.}

Additionally, we investigated whether pre-trained Python models for sentiment analyses predict consumer behaviour and assessed it's association with brain activities during decision-making tasks. Neural and behavioral responses of participants used for analysis of their decision making processes when choosing their product of interest. This has been accomplished while the participants’ brain activities were recorded at pre-test (baseline) and during each decision-making tasks. Results of this study revealed significant association between certain resting-state EEG power spectral densities and consumer decisions.

As product suppliers can no longer secure their competitive position through former product-related competitive advantages, more complex product offerings and integrated solutions consisting of products and services, so-called “product-service systems (PSS)”, are increasingly being offered. But how can PSS implementation and the digital servitization transformation process be successfully accomplished? This paper addresses this research question and examines the transformation process of several companies using a mixed-methods approach that includes the evaluation of objective data-based efficiency for an idealized servitization path. The study shows how important it is for companies to maintain or even strengthen former product-based competitive advantages and to build on them to develop new business areas. It also shows that companies are simultaneously implementing bi-directional product support services and customer support services. In addition, data-oriented services such as condition monitoring and remote services are proving to be the basis for offering more complex performance- and results-oriented PSS, where customers pay per unit produced rather than fixed fees. Moreover, for the first time, it can be concluded that digital services are the basis for the successful establishment of digital industrial IoT platforms.}

An online field survey was conducted to collect primary data from the respondents during the month of April 2021, and the total number of participants was recorded as 102. In order to reach conclusions, mainly two types of statistical hypothesis tests were carried out. Hypothesis test 1 was conducted to determine whether the respondents were demonstrating a significant usage increase in the average number of online shopping transactions per month and during the Covid-19 pandemic time. Hypothesis test 2 was conducted to determine whether there was a difference in the average number of online shopping transactions per month during the pandemic time of the respondents based on their age group. Descriptive and inferential statistics, including the matched-pairs test and one-way ANOVA, were applied to the analysis. The researcher is in a position confirm that there is a significant difference in the average number of online shopping transactions per month before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, there is no significant difference in the average number of online shopping transactions per month during the pandemic time made by representants of two generations, generation X and Millennials. The results of the study were significant since the primary data collection was done during April 2021. The pilot study will help to understand how the respondents online buying behaviour through mobile phone usage changed during the pandemic. The added value of the conducted pilot study involves filling in a gap regarding the differences and similarities between generational groups on mobile shopping during the Covid-19 pandemic time.}

By conducting three studies, users’ conscious and unconscious (neural) evaluations of ecommerce websites are explored. The self-reported results reveal that men and women do not significantly differ in their expressed evaluations of ecommerce websites. However, the neural results indicate that gender-related differences in the perception of ecommerce websites are influenced by unconscious effects, which might explain the inconsistent gender-specific research findings. Men tend to require greater neural activity when using ecommerce websites. Websites evaluated as useful and visually aesthetic lead to significant neural activation in brain regions of the left hemisphere for men in comparison to women, whereas websites evaluated as less useful and appealing reveal neural activation in brain regions of the right hemisphere in male participants. The results provide several theoretical and practical implications for the evaluation of gender-specific decision making on ecommerce websites.}

A commercial dataset from ComScore’s US panel of one million users is used to illustrate a new approach to measure and evaluate the online performance of competitors in the US airline market. The methodology and associated performance framework demonstrate the potential for new forms of market intelligence based on the visualization of market networks, online performance calculated from matrix algorithms, the measurement of the impact of search intermediaries, and the identification of latent relationships.

This article presents a modern type of warehouse based on IoT, using existing technology such RFID solution, to increase inventory reliability by reducing the risk of human errors and it covers 90% of all warehouse operations. Through this article, we analyzed the main areas of improvement for RFID solution, such it does not cover the picking area; unlike in gross storage areas where every palette may contain an RFID Tag in permanent communication with ERP/WMS. However, in the retail area the products are not tracked (possibly but expensive), leaving low visibility on real-time inventory behind with the risk of inventory shortage for items already ordered by customers on the e-commerce platform or excess inventory. The solution we proposed covers this flaw, by creating smart picking areas, based on weighing to get primary data to be quantified. This solution increases inventory reliability and responsivity by helping the retail areas resupply and mastering the picking and preparation delays.}

Fashion consumers are faced with a tradeoff between price and seasonality of fashion items as discounts are used to sell last season's stock. We find that private label choice is positively influenced by price orientation and less by discount proneness. Thus, private label shoppers are rather a fashion savvy segment focusing on buying more in season but at a lower price.}

These challenges may lead to order tardiness and decreased efficiency and responsiveness of warehouse logistics. This study jointly optimizes order picking and delivery in ergonomic picking systems by addressing order assignment, sequencing, picking, and delivery operations while considering due dates and minimizing order tardiness and delivery costs. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model is formulated, and an improved knowledge-guided fruit fly optimization algorithm with the shortest waiting time rule (IKGFOA-SWT) as a heuristic solution procedure is developed to solve the problem. The IKGFOA-SWT comprises three modules including an order assignment and sequencing module using IKGFOA, an order picking module employing the SWT rule, and a batch delivery module balancing the delivery and tardiness costs. Computational experiments are conducted to validate the MIP model and evaluate the performance of IKGFOA-SWT. The benchmark experiment underscores the importance of integrating order picking and delivery operations within a unified scheduling framework rather than treating them as independent optimization tasks. The small-scale experiment verifies the effectiveness of IKGFOA-SWT in finding optimal solutions. The large-scale experiment demonstrates the superiority of IKGFOA-SWT in generating high-quality solutions. This study provides valuable managerial insights and practical tools for the optimization of warehouse logistics operations, and contributes to the new norms of supply chain sustainability and resilience.}

Nonetheless, the Sarawak State Government had deployed the Sarawak Digital Economy Strategy 2018-2022 blueprint as one of their initiatives to position Sarawak as a high-income state. To boost Sarawak's Digital Economy, promoting and implementing eCommerce is crucial. Yet, the key challenge lies in ensuring full acceptance and adoption of this transformative approach by all stakeholders. Therefore, this research was carried out to offer valuable insights to the state government regarding the factors that influence the sustainability of current eCommerce platforms in Sarawak. The date collected from Sarawakians served as the foundation for this study. Data from 130 individuals residing in Sarawak was collected through e-survey, employing a quantitative research method. The findings indicate that the sustainability of an eCommerce platform in Sarawak is influenced by the extent to which it aids users in achieving their objectives. Additionally, the Sarawak community's awareness of the advantages and risks associated with using eCommerce platforms was identified as another factor impacting platform sustainability. In summary, this study highlights significant factors that can contribute to the development of Sarawak's Digital Economy. By identifying these variables, it provides valuable insights that can serve as a call to action for the state government.}

With a projected market of $800 billion by 2024, the metaverse is expected to radically reshape retailing in the digital world. However, very little is known about the metaverse from a customer, retailer, or brand perspective. This article summarizes how the metaverse has been conceptualized thus far in the literature and the popular press. The authors offer a new conceptualization of the metaverse that contains four distinct dimensions: online collaboration, high consumer immersion, unique digital assets, and digital personas. Considering that the technologies currently used to provide high consumer immersion (e.g., augmented reality, virtual reality) and unique digital assets (e.g., blockchain technology) are not fully developed or commercialized, the authors also propose the concept of a transitory metaverse to understand the current stage of metaverse development better. The authors conclude by providing 27 directions for future research based on a full factorial of how the metaverse dimensions amplify three customer touchpoints in the digital experience (digital economic exchange, complex social relationships, direct environment interaction) for the three main stakeholders of any retailing exchange (consumers, retailers, brands) along the entire customer journey (pre-purchase, purchase, post-purchase).}

The findings demonstrate that online sellers engaging in more interactions that involve receiving tangible assistance or knowledge tend to realize better online sales performance, while interactions involving providing tangible assistance or knowledge also may benefit sellers’ sales performance through increasing the receipt of resources. In addition, sellers more active in receiving knowledge tend to have higher sales in markets in which they face greater competition intensity. Our study contributes to both research and practice with a more nuanced understanding of interactions in online communities—that is, providing and receiving different types of resources—and their associated sales outcomes.}

Because of the general shortage of urban space, a major challenge is finding an appropriate location for such a hub. This paper provides a decision support tool based on the analytic hierarchy process for the hub location selection problem, which considers quantitative and qualitative criteria. By involving three stakeholder groups – the municipality, logistics companies and citizens – the approach insures a comprehensive view. The application of the model is tested for the location selection of a midi-hub – a medium-sized city hub – in Vienna. Hence, our results show that a good compromise between different stakeholder views regarding a mid-hub location selection problem can be achieved by the application of our AHP-based decision support tool.}

However, there are still problems with the existing methods. Existing approaches can be divided into two groups based on data organization: (1) graph-based methods using graph neural networks to capture complex item transformations; (2) sequence-based approaches using self-attention networks to capture chained user interest patterns. Both methods are only applicable to specific kinds of user interest patterns due to the characteristics of the neural networks they use and cannot be adaptively used in all scenarios. Moreover, the recent approaches capture collaborative information from other sessions by constructing global graphs, etc., in order to enrich the current session, which can compromise personalized modeling due to the introduction of items that are not relevant to the current user. This work proposes a graph-enhanced and collaborative attention network (GCAN) to solve the above problems. In GCAN, graph-enhanced attention is designed to model user interest over item-specific subsequences with the help of a graph mask and distance bias, which include item transformations mined in session graphs and chained user interest in session sequences. In addition, collaborative attention is proposed to model the item representation within the current session at the collaborative level by exploiting the collaborative information from all sessions. Extensive experiments on three real benchmark datasets show that GCAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.}

Drawing on data gathered from a conjoint survey of 350 pet owners in the United States, the study reveals that customers place the highest importance on the attributes of price, product, and personalization when making choices of curation subscription box services. Furthermore, the study identifies three distinct customer segments based on their attribute preferences: those who prioritize the product, those who value personalization most, and those who prioritize price. Additionally, this study employs a conjoint market simulator to propose the most optimized set of offerings in a pet subscription box. The findings have significant implications for the development of curation subscription box services and underscore the importance of aligning the subscription box services business model with customer needs and preferences.}

Unique corroboration entropy is calculated based on the number of words in this review that describe the product on the seller’s site, confirming the seller’s claims, which did not appear in previous reviews. Recommendation entropy is based on the number of words that are associated with explicit recommendations. Unique opinion, referred as “regular opinions” in the literature, entropy is based on the number of all the other words in the review that provide positive or negative evaluations of products as well as other additional informational elements that did not appear in previous reviews. The results show that both recommendation and unique opinion entropies (only marginally) increase review helpfulness evaluations, while greater unique corroboration entropy is insignificant.}

We conduct a two-stage/scale literature review, combining 1) computational topic modelling from a Global Dataset (459 article abstracts) with 2) qualitative content analysis from a sub-dataset focusing on the Nordic region (Nordic Sub-Dataset, 17 full articles). We begin with a topic modelling analysis generating ten major themes (topics) leading to an overview of how research areas are connected to the meaning of rural context. Turning to the Nordic region, as an in-depth example, we illustrate the complexity of rural digital geographies, through a qualitative content analysis. This demonstrates that digital in rural contexts are primarily positioned outwardly as social/regional development and business/economy, and less situated inwardly through individual experience and community building. Combined we show a wide spectrum of rural-digital relations but demonstrate that rural contexts in rural-digital relations need more attention. We propose three propositions to invite deeper rural contextualizations in future digital studies to uphold the importance of rural spaces and places through, by and with digital geography.}

Sentiment analysis (SA) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique which provides an automated solution to this problem. It is a challenging subtask of text classification. Over a long time, researchers have proposed different approaches to solve it. This paper proposes an unsupervised learning approach using transformer architecture to perform SA on women’s clothing e-commerce dataset which is imbalanced in nature. In this study, we have fine-tuned DistilBERT, a cutting-edge transformer based pre-trained model and developed models for two subtasks of SA named as Sentiment Classification (SC) and Product Recommendation (PR). The proposed models have achieved the highest F1 scores (0.79 for SC and 0.85 for PR), AUC scores (0.98 for SC and 0.96 for PR) along with the highest accuracy of 0.96 for SC and 0.91 for PR. We found that the performance of our models is least affected by imbalanced dataset issues. The results show that the proposed models have significantly outperformed the traditional supervised approaches and various other existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. This study can contribute to a better understanding of consumer sentiment and consumer psychology in the e-commerce transaction business.}

abstract = {With live streaming becoming an integral part of a seller’s business strategy, a retailer can choose an influencer from a multi-channel network (MCN) to attract consumers. However, since the MCN may benefit from exaggerating the influencer’s historical live sales data, information asymmetry between the retailer and the MCN exists. This may lead the retailer to misestimate the influencer’s demand-enhancing capability (DEC), and then suffer loss. As the usage of blockchain in providing trust becomes more common, an MCN can apply blockchain technology to signal its data reliably to a retailer. However, conditions for MCN to adopt blockchain and its impact on retailer’s influencers choice has not been investigated so far. To fill this gap, we built a signaling model in which an MCN knows the actual information reliability whereas the retailer does not. We find that the retailer opens a live-streaming channel only if the operating cost is low but the retailer will use its own staff in the live streaming rather than an influencer from MCN if the commission is high. This makes the MCN to refrain from adopting blockchain technology. Meanwhile, the blockchain adoption decisions of the MCN and its impact on the retailer’s influencers choice not only depend on the adoption cost but also the commission. Specifically, when the adoption cost is low, a high-reliability MCN benefits more from adopting blockchain technology, which incentivizes the retailer to choose a high-DEC influencer; as the adoption cost increases, retailers become unable to judge the MCN’s information reliability, especially when the commission level is too low or too high; when the adoption cost increases to a moderate range, multiple equilibria co-exist, indicating that an MCN’s willingness to adopt blockchain technology depends on the retailer’s belief. We find that all equilibria survive the intuitive criterion, but, from both types of MCN’s perspectives, the equilibrium without blockchain adoption is always Pareto-dominant. When the adoption cost is high, an MCN has no incentive to adopt blockchain technology.}

abstract = {Considering the technological and institutional nature, along with the inherent complexity, of the rural digital governance context, a data-driven institutional pressure transmission (D-IPT) mechanism is developed in this study. This mechanism aims to facilitate effective regulation of villagers' behaviours, thereby improving rural digital governance performance. Firstly, we proposed a conceptual model based on complex adaptive systems theory and institutional theory to demonstrate how this mechanism can ensure an improvement of the emergent rural digital governance performance. Subsequently, we translated the conceptual model into a computational representation, thereby constructing a theory-informed simulation model. A behavioural dataset consists of 1,255,206 rural households from 119 villages over a span of 18 months was used to instantiate and validate the simulation model based on a specific scenario. Then, we designed five simulation experiments to investigate interventions aimed at harnessing the D-IPT mechanism more effectively to improve the rural digital governance performance. The results show that interventions targeting interaction efficiency, interaction frequency, and institutional environment configuration significantly affect the role of the D-IPT mechanism in enhancing rural governance performance. Finally, we discussed the theoretical and practical implications of the D-IPT mechanism.}

Advanced information technology and vast amounts of consumer data have empowered online retail platforms to share demand information with manufacturers, which can motivate manufacturers to improve product quality. However, the double marginalization effect is potentially exacerbated. Considering quality distrust, this paper develops a multi-stage game-theoretical model to study the interplay between blockchain adoption and information sharing strategy. The analysis not only investigates the dependence of the interplay on the quality cost coefficient and the unit cost of blockchain adoption, but also endeavors to determine the equilibrium strategy combination of blockchain adoption and information sharing. The findings indicate that blockchain adoption can alleviate the double marginalization effect and improve product quality conditionally. Additionally, irrespective of the level of consumers trust, the manufacturer exhibits a propensity to embrace blockchain technology. This adoption of blockchain has the potential to incentivize the online platform to share demand information under certain conditions. Several extended modelling analyses are conducted to check the robustness of the main model and additional insights are obtained.}

In two studies, consumers rate their perception of produce offered in an online shop. Specifically, consumers assess quality concerns, affective response, and willingness to pay (WTP) in offline versus online retail contexts. Results demonstrate that high-NFT consumers express higher quality concerns and lower affective response to online offered produce. This negative influence of NFT is stronger if consumers use indirect compared to direct touch interfaces. Further, NFT influences WTP difference between offline and online offered produce. Online retailers therefore need to carefully manage quality concerns and negative perceptions that high-NFT consumers express during online produce shopping. A third study proposes a solution through online videos as visual design features. Displaying haptic evaluations of high-touch diagnostic produce by other consumers successfully negates NFT’s adverse influences.}

Inspired by this fact, we study normative prescriptions and models that can be used to coordinate sustainable supply chains considering supply chain leaders' WTC behaviour. Along this line, we adopt a multi-methodological approach and carry out a two-stage analysis of a three-player duopoly supply chain (SDSC) with a leader (i.e., the focal firm) and two competitive followers who provide sustainable products or services. In the first stage, we adopt a non-cooperative game to characterize the interactions within five non-cooperative and cooperative models. In the second stage, to coordinate the SDSC, we first derive the characteristic functions from the equilibrium results of the five models and then revise the classical equal allocation of the non-separable contribution (EANSC) value by incorporating the leader's WTC behavioural parameter. This revised EANSC value serves as a novel solution and thereby enhances the scientific value of the cooperative game theoretical approach. Analytical and numerical studies show that under conditions in which the leader has power and is willing to cede, the optimal coordinated solutions can be obtained when both sustainability competition and the WTC are at a low level; leaders are not willing to cede profits if sustainability competition is high due to product substitutability between two followers. This research illustrates how behavioural theory and non-cooperative and cooperative game theory can be sufficiently modified and adopted to advance supply chain-level cooperation for sustainability. We further carry out a survey and interviews to provide empirical evidence to support our findings.}

Simultaneously, the data and insights that can inform consumer attitudes and behaviors often reside outside of firms' direct control. Consciously incorporating these interdependent factors into firms' decision-making is essential for adaptability and sustainable profitability. Building on the “outside-in” perspective, we propose that firm strategies should be informed through the lens of the marketing ecosystem that considers the interrelated and dynamic megatrends. By leveraging advances in data and technology, firms can sense-make the marketplace by extracting insights from massive amounts of diverse consumer data with modern-day analytics. By mapping out the megatrends with marketing analytics, firms can 1) more accurately predict consumers' changing preferences and formulate appropriate strategies to engage with them; and 2) become more market-adaptable and competitive in the present and the future. To deliver sustainably compelling value to customers, firms should adopt an ecosystem mindset and cooperate with various stakeholders. A broad-thinking, agile, and humble firm culture can enable the development of more robust outside-in capabilities. We elaborate on the megatrends in the interconnected world of the marketing ecosystem, and propose emerging research directions in each area.}

It is hence no surprise that the retail sector is one of the hardest-hit sectors in the current pandemic. To understand the short- and longer-term impacts of COVID-19 on retail, we conducted two surveys to understand ongoing changes in the sector. By contrasting changing consumer behavior with the actions taken by local retailers, we assess whether the current pandemic is potentially a catalyst for e-commerce in Belgium. We do this based on a newly constructed framework of e-retail accessibility, as the differences between online and physical retail require a revision of the traditional economic geographical perspective on retail performance as introduced by Christaller (1933). We conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic holds ample opportunities for an increase in the three components of e-retail accessibility, but that a lack of professionalism might prevent traditional local retailers to retain a share of the expanded online market. This could well mean the final blow for local brick and mortar shops if, as is predicted, the share of online shopping in total retail expenditure remains high after the pandemic.}

Newsletters emerged as an important conversion channel to engage readers as they provide a personalized experience by building habits. However, the lack of human resources and the need for more content assertiveness per reader lead publishers to search for an advanced analytics solution. We address this problem by proposing a research agenda on news recommendation algorithms inspired in the table d’hôte approach and the concept of ‘personalized diversity’. Thus, the reader receives a personalized newsletter where he can discover informative and surprising content. The goal is to offer a self-contained package that retains readers, increases loyalty and consequently, the propensity to subscribe. A live controlled experiment with readers from the Portuguese newspaper Público was performed and a new approach is proposed. We study the effects of content recommendations on the behavior of newsletter subscribers. Findings reveal that serendipitous content tends to increase reader engagement. Finally, we propose a table d’hôte approach and new challenges are identified for future research.}

Previous personalized recommendation methods identify user preferences by analyzing historical purchase data. As the user preferences reflected in the user–item matrix take only two values: like or dislike, the binary purchase data-based method is too constrained to capture individual diverse opinions and user preferences evolution. Despite the fact that online search queries explicitly express consumers’ content preferences for product attributes, very little research has focused on inferring user preferences from online queries. To this end, this study proposes a novel temporal recommendation method based on estimating consumers’ dynamic preferences from their search queries. Our approach involves: first, proposing a temporal topic model that utilizes a Markov process to predict users’ potential interests, and then integrating customer preferences and product attribute features into a unified product ranking model to obtain personalized and diversified product lists. Empirical analysis shows that the proposed approach can better capture the temporal dynamics of customer preferences drift and can more accurately predict consumer purchase intentions. Furthermore, products recommended by the proposed approach not only better match individual preferences, but also cover more diverse content topics.}

Considering e-tailers’ broader question of how best to counteract these marketplaces, we consider three of online sales modes, namely, the traditional, consignment, and in-marketplace selling modes. In particular, we investigate the interaction between a supplier’s strategy for introducing a marketplace channel and an e-tailer’s choice of selling mode. Our analysis reveals that the e-tailer’s selling mode choice depends not only on the performance of both the supplier and the marketplace but also channel competition. In general, the e-tailer prefers the in-marketplace selling mode with a higher marketplace service level and the consignment mode with higher supplier selling efficiency. If a marketplace channel exists, traditional reselling is a better choice when both the marketplace service level and the supplier selling efficiency are restricted to the middle range. The underlying mechanism is that traditional reselling is less negatively affected by the competition effect. Finally, we find that the supplier wants to eschew the marketplace channel and strategically induce the e-tailer to sell through it even though the marketplace service level is relatively high. This research provides guidance not only for the supplier’s channel choice but also for the small- and medium-sized e-tailers’ choice of selling mode when encountering the online marketplace.}

abstract = {This article focuses on Chinese Internet firms' overseas expansion, particularly in the European market. By relying on an exploratory approach and by conducting in-depth case studies of three high-profile firms – Alibaba (AliExpress), Tencent (WeChat) and ByteDance (TikTok), the research provides rich insights into such expansion, and more specifically, an understanding of their motives, strategies and challenges. The research contributes to the limited literature on the internationalization of Chinese service firms. While largely affirming the literature on internationalization, the multiple case study approach adopted provides rich granular insights into the distinctive motives, strategies and challenges that Chinese Internet firms can face in the European market. It identifies particular nuances that are easily missed in studies based on secondary data. In particular, two clearly distinct processes of internationalization in Europe emerge. While existing work on the internationalization of Chinese Internet firms has mostly regarded them as a cohesive and homogeneous set of companies, our findings suggest that we are dealing with two different sets of companies whose approaches toward internationalization seem to be radically different, revealing two tales of internationalization. From the findings it emerges that differently from the Internet firms that started to internationalize earlier as part of a “first wave” of internationalization, the firms that started to internationalize later as a part of a “second wave” have done so, with a significant speedier pace by also adopting a bolder internationalization strategy that shares some common features with the first movers but that also displays a remarkably higher level of sophistication. Significantly, this type of firm does not seem to suffer from any liability of any kind.}

abstract = {The fast-paced growth of e-commerce is impacting the type and variety of products consumers purchase across channels. A commonly held theory, known as long tail theory, posits that online sales are less concentrated at the top of the sales distribution than offline sales, and that more variety is bought online, making the tails of the overall sales distribution denser with the growth of e-commerce. Most of the literature testing the long tail theory has focused on examining entertainment goods markets that do not require much physical examination, and has predominantly found results consistent with the theory. However, the magnitude and antecedents of the observed long tail effects might be different for product categories containing products that require more physical examination before purchase, such as fashion goods. In this study, using detailed individual and transaction level panel data from two multichannel fashion goods retail brands, we show that while the shift to the online channel results in a decrease in the concentration of overall sales for both brands, this change mostly results from consumers buying different products online rather than consumers buying a greater variety online compared to offline. We show that the flattening of the overall sales distribution with the growth of e-commerce in our data is driven by consumers sorting their purchases into channels based on product characteristics. In contrast to the recommendations from the previous long tail literature, our results show that fashion apparel retailers do not need to offer broader assortments online compared to offline, but they may find it profitable to carry or emphasize a different product mix online compared to offline. Our results also provide guidance to fashion goods retailers in curating their online and offline assortments and setting inventory management strategies across the channels.}

The study used an online survey of 163 Chinese customers and a pride-inducing methodology to investigate how pride in purchasing pro-environmental technology could lead to positive spillovers. A Partial Least Squares approach to Structural Equation Modelling was used to analyse the results. Feelings of pride elicited by the intentions to purchase the novel technology positively affect subsequent behaviours of reducing energy consumption by other means (same domain), as well as recycling and reusing materials (different domain). Pride appeals can be leveraged by social businesses as by definition they focus on the social good and, according to our findings, pride-inducing messages enhance the impacts of the pro-environmental technology adoption. Such spillovers can be beneficial to society, thus allowing social businesses to satisfy social and financial goals at the same time.}

Consumers vary in their degree of preference match with firms’ products; the higher preference mismatch, the longer a consumer searches online seeking a better matching alternative. Firms can infer consumers’ preferences based on their digital footprints during their online search and customize their reminder advertising campaign. The default strategy is to pursue all website visitors with a uniform reminder advertising campaign.

Through a meta-analytic study, we explored consumer behavior in SC, compared different theoretical frameworks, tested the moderators among variables, and tested the effect of the factors derived from consumer behavior theory on the stages of consumer decision-making. We found the variables from TAM, TRA/TPB, UTAUT, and the IS Success model to be important in motivating consumer behavior. Furthermore, we found the variables from the IS Success model to be less strongly correlated with SC behavior than the variables from other theories. In contrast, the variables from UTAUT are more strongly correlated with SC behavior. We found interpersonal trust to be more strongly correlated with SC behavior (r+=0.497) compared with organizational trust (r+=0.411). More importantly, we found the difference to be statistically significant (Z=-3.838). This study makes theoretical contributions through a moderator analysis, which helps to better understand the underlying consumer behavior theories, and further examines the role of trust in the integration of such theories. The study also makes contributions to practice by informing SC platform providers on how their consumers behave during the stages of the purchase decision-making process.}

Eight hundred and fifty-eight users of various fitness apps have responded to the questionnaire. Results show that people who are open to changing their fitness systems from traditional to app-based services enjoy new experiences and new product behaviours. For them, the perceived functional barriers to service adoption don't hold them back. At the same time the users of fitness apps try to get health and fitness information from as many sources as possible, like friends, peer groups, the newspaper and social networking apps. Users with a high level of health consciousness are more likely to be active in their health and fitness. People who use apps make decisions based on new information from the integrated model. App providers should think about how to get and keep users interested in their apps, personalise their experience, and design features that make users invested in the apps.}

After a 20-min getting-acquainted chat, participants reported their affective state and relational evaluations of the chat. Additionally, all chats were recorded and text analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program. In all conditions, participants reported moderate levels of positive emotions and low levels of negative emotions. Those who chatted FTF with a human reported significantly more negative emotions than those who chatted with a bot. However, those who chatted with a human also reported more homophily with and liking of their chat partner and that their partner was more responsive. Meanwhile, participants had fewest conversational concerns with the chatbot. These findings have implications for future computer-mediated interaction studies: conversations with chatbots appear to have different affordances and effects on chatter enjoyment and conversational concerns in getting-acquainted contexts. These results may help designers improve reception and marketability for chatbots in consumer markets.}

The proposed model was empirically evaluated using survey data collected from 219 users responding about their perceptions of customer service chatbots. The findings indicate that AI chatbot service recovery quality and AI chatbot conversational quality significantly influence user satisfaction. On the other hand, core AI chatbot service quality and satisfaction significantly influenced chatbot user loyalty. This study contributes to researchers and practitioners by proposing and evaluating a more comprehensive chatbot e-service quality that combines both fundamental (core service and service recovery qualities) and human-like (conversational quality) aspects of e-service.

Given daily updates of load information, the paths for the five deployment scenarios are adjusted using two daily updating strategies. Both strategies start with a base plan in which paths are generated based on the historic daily distribution of load dispatches during an average week. The two strategies are: (1) Option 1: re-optimization of pre-booked loads and new requests, and (2) Option 2: optimization of new requests only. The solutions of the two strategies are compared to the hindsight plan which assumes complete information of actual requests placed. The presented formulations are tested out on an industry partner’s network. Results show that the savings achieved with re-optimization (Option 1) compared to insertion (Option 2) increase with more demand variability; this outcome is consistent across all fleet mixes. When most of the loads are new arrivals, the computational time of the two approaches is comparable and insertion is less attractive than re-optimization. With daily re-optimization, most of the plan changes adjust the terminals visited by a load compared to just changing the dispatch and arrival times along the load’s path.}

abstract = {In online retailing, in addition to the reseller channel, the marketplace channel has been favored by many e-commerce platforms and suppliers. Different from the reseller channel, the novel channel enables suppliers to obtain the pricing power of products and to have direct contact with consumers. However, due to the operation inefficiency of suppliers and the competition caused by adding a new channel, for suppliers and platforms, decisions on the establishment of the marketplace channel are more complex. In addition, logistics service, which affects the purchase behavior of online consumers and is considered the key to the success of online retailing, can be undertaken by both suppliers and platforms. Based on these considerations, this paper explores whether the supplier and the platform can come to an agreement on introducing the marketplace channel by incorporating the logistics service strategy. We find that compared with the product sales price, the level of logistics service has a stronger impact on the consumers’ channel choice. A scenario we term RE-MS (the marketplace channel is established, and the platform and the supplier serve as the logistics providers in the reseller and the marketplace channels, respectively) produces the highest level of logistics service in the reseller channel, and a scenario termed RS-MS (the marketplace channel is established, and the supplier serves as the logistics provider in both channels) generates the highest level of logistics service in the marketplace channel. The supplier is always willing to add the marketplace channel and undertake logistics business in the marketplace channel. However, for the platform, adding the marketplace channel is advantageous only when the logistics service effectiveness or the commission rate is high. Additionally, when the supplier and the platform reach a consensus on the establishment of the marketplace channel, the RE-MS strategy can realize a win–win situation.}

Although privacy in social media is well studied, the role of social (peer) privacy concerns is largely unknown and most privacy studies on mobile apps focus on initial adoption and ignore long-term behavioral outcomes. Drawing on the privacy calculus theory, this study examines the impact of both institutional and social privacy concerns on long-term user engagement with social media-enabled apps. Findings from the analysis of 354 survey responses reveal that both institutional and social privacy concerns decrease engagement. Regarding the antecedents, the perceived sensitivity of information increases institutional privacy concerns. However, social privacy concerns are influenced by the perception of risk and control. Moreover, while the impacts of social and enjoyment benefits are expectedly positive, the perception of efficiency benefits decreases engagement. These findings are further investigated and validated through a follow-up text analysis study, suggesting that users who enjoy the functionality of these apps are more likely to express social privacy concerns and minimize their engagement. This study contributes to the literature of privacy on mobile apps by unraveling the intricate dynamics of privacy concerns and benefits in the social mobile era.}

Thus, investigating fraudulent accounts' behaviour of generating fake negative or positive reviews for competitors or themselves and the necessity of ML classifiers to identify fraudulent reviews, is more important than ever. In this research, we present a novel feature engineering approach in which we (1) extract several “review-centric” and “reviewer-centric” features from a dataset; (2) combine the cumulative effects of features distributions into a unified model that represents overall behavior of the fraudulent reviewers; (3) investigate the role of effective data pre-processing to improve detection accuracy; and (4) develop a probabilistic approach to detect fraudulent reviewers by learning a novel M-SMOTE model over a derived balanced dataset and feature distributions, which outperforms other ML models. Our study contributes to the literature on digital platforms and fraudulent review detection with significant managerial and theoretical implications through these novel findings.}

Moreover, we view interpersonal influence as a moderator and test its impact on the correlation between the consumers' perceived value and their IBB. Data were collected through a survey in China (n = 199). The results show that environmental stimuli significantly influence consumer perceived values (i.e., perceived utilitarian value and perceived hedonic value), and the consumers’ perception of hedonic value significantly and directly impacts their IBB. In addition, the interaction effect of perceived hedonic value and interpersonal influence significantly affects IBB. The findings provide valuable guidance for m-commerce retailers to induce consumer IBB.}

As the upsurge of brand popularity and their social growth on social media channels, the role to analyze and investigate the competitor's behaviours on social media becomes a crucial part. By utilizing these behaviours a brand can investigate and optimize their competitive strategies in order to enhance the audience reach, improved customer acquisition and increase in overall profits. Therefore, monitoring and analyzing the social media behaviour of competitors is a cutting edge direction towards the enhancement of competitive benefits and efficiently decipher the competition. This research paper is an effort to help brands to know the insights such as the posts which are promoted compared to those which are organic. This article presents the detailed description of novel approach applied for promoted post detection problem. Promoted post detection makes use of social media data to provide insights related to brand's own and competitors posting behaviours and promotional strategies. We make use of ensemble machine learning techniques-bagging and boosting to train different weak learners and combine the results by majority voting and weighted average. We make use of a logistic regression model in stacking while combining used generalized linear model and ensemble models. Results show the 95% accuracy, 97% precision, 96.5% Recall and 97% F1 score of classification results of brand promoted posts as boosted or organic. The result unveils that ensemble technique stands out as an effective approach for social media promoted post detection.}

Meanwhile, Incidents like the current global pandemic have further exacerbated such a challenge by causing fluctuations in online demand for products like groceries. To address this, e-retailers can adopt third-party logistics providers (3PLs) as business partners. Specifically, this paper aims to address freight shipping fulfillment policies by considering an e-channel where an e-retailer (e.g., e-grocer) has a limited in-house shipping fleet and can hire additional shipping services from a 3PL to encounter demand volatility. We evaluate and compare two different contracts from the perspective of the e-retailer/3PL and e-channel: (1) a conventional contract in which the e-retailer hires shipping services from a 3PL in advance, but in case of not exercising units of hired service, incurs a penalty, and (2) an option contract in which the e-retailer can reserve/exercise shipping services from 3PL who decides on contract terms. We find that when e-channel demand volatility is high the option contract results in e-channel coordination, and both parties are better off. We further demonstrate that when e-channel demand volatility is low, the option contract is detrimental for the e-retailer and a profitable case for 3PL. Thus, the e-retailer prefers to participate in the conventional contract, as opposed to the priority of 3PL and e-channel.}

This program covers several types of mass transportation in Jakarta such as Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), Light Rail Transit (LRT), Electric Train (KRL Commuter Line), and Bus Transjakarta (TJ). In hope, the people will be interested to switch their modes of transportation to using public transportation considering the congestion and air pollution in Jakarta which is horrible. By utilizing data from twitter, this study tries to analyze public opinion on public transportation by classifying theirs opinions into positive & negative. Furthermore, topic modeling activites will be conducted using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method to find out topics that are often discussed publicly for each public transportation. It was found that the KRL is the only type of public transportation with the number of negative responses exceeding the number of positive responses. It was found that in the MRT & LRT, the community tended to mention words that had positive sentiments, whereas in KRL & TJ people tended to mention words that had negative sentiments. In the grouping of public opinion, the LDA model produced a topic of public discussion on public transportation that was different for each type of public transportation. The model can also capture public communication with the official account administration of public transportation. Prediction models obtained the lowest error with a Mean Average Percentage Error of 8.79%. By adding the public sentiment variable, it can improve the accuracy of the prediction model, but the tweets sentiment variable has no direct relationship to the variable number of public transportation users.}

Although contrastive learning has been used extensively to address this problem, existing methods generally consider all other sessions in the mini-batch as negative samples, leading to a limited negative sample space and a failure to distinguish real negative samples from false negative samples. Thus, Semantic-enhanced Contrastive Learning for Session-based Recommendation (SCLRec) is proposed in this study. Specifically, a queue is designed to store session samples, and a momentum encoder is used to ensure high consistency in the large-capacity sample space. Furthermore, a novel semantic-enhanced mechanism is devised to filter out false negative samples and increase the weights of high-confidence negative samples according to semantic similarity scores between sessions, effectively reducing noise and enhancing contrastive learning. Moreover, the gated attention unit is used as the encoder to obtain excellent performance and efficiency compared with traditional attention networks. Extensive experiments on three real-world public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a relatively low time complexity.}

Specifically, the authors focus on five strategies: (1) the addition of online channel by an offline retailer; (2) the addition (or subtraction) of offline channels by an online retailer; (3) addition of mobile shopping channel (website and/or app) by offline and/or online retailer; (4) cross-channel integration strategies; and (5) retail marketing mix strategies. The author/s integrate findings from empirical research on these strategies into a number of ‘insights’ about ‘what we know’. Prominent among these are the following: Adding a transactional online channel to an offline channel improves the retailer's overall sales even though offline channel sales can be cannibalized to some degree. Adding an offline channel by an online retailer, however, boosts online channel sales as well as overall sales of the retailer. Similarly, adding a mobile shopping channel usually increases customer purchase frequency and amount and overall sales of the retailer in the long-term. Strategies for greater cross-channel integration generally have a positive effect on a retailer's overall performance while online advertising has positive effects on offline channel consideration and sales as well as overall sales of a multichannel retailer. Other insights or findings that need further study or open questions are also identified. The paper closes with managerial implications of the derived empirical insights, and suggestions for future research.}

Previous research efforts mainly focus on capturing sequential transitions between consecutive items via recurrent neural networks (RNN) or modeling the complex transitions between non-adjacent items based on graph neural networks (GNN). Although these works have achieved encouraging performance on solving the session-based recommendation problem, few efforts have been dedicated to exploring the rich information related to the shifts of user interests within the transition relationships, which is the research gap we attempt to bridge in this work. In this paper, we propose a novel model, named Time Enhanced Graph Neural Networks (TE-GNN), which attempts to capture the complex user interest shift patterns within sessions. In TE-GNN, we construct a Time Enhanced Session Graph (TES-Graph) where transition relationships between items are treated adaptively with respect to the degree of user interest drift. In addition, a novel Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (T-GCN) is designed to learn item embeddings based on the TES-Graph. Moreover, we also introduce a Temporal Interest Attention Network (TIAN) to model the complex transition of items with a common user interest. Extensive experiments have been conducted on four widely used benchmark datasets, i.e., Diginetica, Tmall, Nowplaying, and Retailrocket, and the results show that our proposed approach TE-GNN significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline methods.

PPM Theory simply describes why people move and the outcome of the migration, which regrettably ignores the risk factors arising during the process. For instance, there are risks associated with consumers switching from offline cosmetic purchases to making online purchases using Augmented Reality (AR) technology, and consumers are frequently reluctant to make purchases when there is risk involved. Many customers wonder about the performance risk of AR technology and its effectiveness. This situation raises the question: Does the PPM factor wipe out the performance risks arising throughout the process of switching behavior? The study's findings provide evidence that PPM is not always linked to issues with switching behavior. Theoretical and practical implications are presented.}

abstract = {Unlike most studies focusing on the manufacturer’s channel strategy, we investigate how a retailer strategically acquires and shares consumer quality preference information when confronting manufacturer encroachment. As a follower, the manufacturer decides the quality level and sales quantity based on the information he holds. Considering the retailer’s flexibility in acquisition timing, we focus on two formats, namely committed acquisition and contingent acquisition, depending on whether the retailer commits to her acquisition decision before or after the manufacturer’s quality investment. Assuming the manufacturer provides identical product through different selling channels, we find that when the manufacturer’s direct selling efficiency is high, contingent acquisition is always a weakly dominant strategy, while the retailer is suggested to commit to acquire information if and only if the direct selling efficiency is low and the acquisition cost is relatively high. If the consumer quality preference is acquired, information sharing occurs only when the direct selling efficiency is sufficiently high, via which the retailer can induce a lower expected wholesale price, gain a higher market share, and achieve a “win-win” situation. With the information advantage, the retailer can always obtain a positive profit in the distribution channel, while the inefficient manufacturer may stop selling in the direct channel when consumers have a low preference for quality. Our result explains why, despite manufacturers directly obtain profits from their own channels, they still sell products through retail channels and even treat them as main distributive ways. Based on the above equilibrium outcomes, we derive the retailer’s optimal strategy for information management, whereby the retailer can not only induce the highest product quality, but also the highest consumer surplus as compared to other acquisition strategies. Our work can guide retailers to better implement information strategies when confronting manufacturer encroachment.}

This paper studies the selection strategy of e-commerce sales mode and information sharing strategy in a dual-channel supply chain. The manufacturer and e-retailer enter a Stackelberg competition. The e-retailer independently decides to share or not share forecasting demand information to the manufacturer. The results show that only if the investment efficiency of the manufacturer’s after-sales service is high, e-retailer is willing to share demand forecasting information. Information sharing does not always add value to the e-retailer, which may lead to the ‘precision trap’ of the e-retailer. Moreover, forecasting accuracy always has a positive impact on the e-retailer’s profit. However, the manufacturer would benefit from more accurate forecasting demand in the case of sharing information. Otherwise, prediction accuracy is negatively correlated with the manufacturer’s profit. Besides, the selection strategy of e-commerce sales mode depends on the level of the manufacturer’s investment efficiency. Specifically, if the manufacturer invests in after-sales service more efficiently, platform sales mode is preferred. If not, they prefer wholesale sales mode.}

This paper investigates the impact of app adoption on the number of additional products purchased by customers (i.e., cross-buying) and how this effect varies across different product categories and different customers. We focus on two key product category characteristics (utilitarian vs. hedonic nature and perceived risk) and on adopters who vary in their adoption timings (early vs. late adopters). Using data from an online retailer and a combination of propensity score weighting with difference-in-differences and Heckman correction estimation techniques, the results show that app adoption has a positive effect on cross-buying overall, but the effect varies greatly across products and consumers. App adoption promotes additional product purchases for hedonic products but leads to less cross-buying for utilitarian products. In addition, early adopters purchase a higher number of additional product categories than late adopters, with this difference decreasing over time and for new consumers compared to existing customers. These results offer novel insights into the behavioral consequences of app adoption and provide managers with useful recommendations for improving the effectiveness of their mobile app investments.}

As a result, many retailers take various return leniency measures to ease the applicability of product returns for customers, which increases the frequency of returns in the market and has huge economic impacts on retailers. Therefore, it is necessary to accurately understand the impact of return leniency on both retailers’ profit and consumers’ welfare to outline return leniency strategies wisely and maximize profit and social welfare. We present a comprehensive model considering the impacts of major factors influencing customer behavior, such as return leniency, customer heterogeneity, and the endowment effect, in addition to the other frequently researched aspects in the literature (i.e., product expenses, hassle cost, salvage value). Our model calculates the probability of purchasing, keeping, and returning products to demonstrate the impact of return leniency, determining the optimal price and refund levels to optimize the retailer’s expected profit and the consumer’s loss, and optimizing social welfare. We use a set of numerical experiments over a wide range of parameter values that could cover almost all practical circumstances. Among other findings, our analysis shows that return leniency can be beneficial or detrimental to the retailer depending on the product acquisition cost, endowment effect, and product salvage value, which usually increases social welfare up to some level.}

The latter has significantly grown during the last two decades, with further amplifications during the COVID-19 pandemic. This has created operational and policy making challenges for firms when deciding about how best to manage the resulting growth in e-commerce. While the impact of e-commerce on supply chains has been widely recognized in the literature, there was no effort to systematically review the literature, conceptualize some of the challenges and propose future research directions. This paper fills this gap by reviewing 153 publications from 1999 to 2019. We classify the reviewed literature based on which supply chain drivers were investigated, as well as, the employed research methodology. In addition, we conduct network and content analysis to uncover the main research themes and potential research directions namely, developing analytical centred; modelling based ecosystem for environment; leveraging data mining to enhance sustainability; balance between growth and sustainability; consumer demand and uncertainty; coordination in e-commerce logistics; last mile alternatives and cost management of innovative technique implementations. Furthermore, based on our literature review, we propose a conceptual framework where we interlink supply chain stages with a firm’s business strategy, digital transformation strategy and performance.}

Traditionally, customer churn prediction was dependent on binary classifiers, which are often optimized for accuracy-based performance measures. However, there is a growing consensus that this approach may not always fulfill the critical business objective of profit maximization, as it overlooks the costs of misclassification and the benefits of accurate classification. This study adopts extreme gradient boosting trees to predict profit-driven customer churn. The class weights and other hyperparameters of these trees are optimized using Bayesian methods based on the profit maximization criterion. Empirical analyses are conducted using real datasets obtained from service providers in multiple markets. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model yields significantly higher profits than the benchmark models. Bayesian optimization and adjustment of class weights contributed to enhanced model profitability. Furthermore, when optimizing multiple hyperparameters, the computational cost of model optimization is significantly reduced compared with an exhaustive grid search. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model through a sensitivity analysis employing Bayesian optimization. Using the proposed model, marketing managers can design targeted marketing plans to retain customer groups with a higher likelihood of churning.}

This study adopts a comparative research approach and investigates direct strategies adopted by various food supply chain actors to mitigate the impact of covid-19. This study compares how retailers Checkers, Woolworths, and Pick n Pay have adapted their business models to remain resilient during COVID-19 lockdown. The results show that the food supply chain remained resilient even with demand management challenges at the lockdown. Food supply chain issues came under a spotlight as borders and production plants were shut down or restricted to contain the spread of the virus. This study establishes that the food shortage is primarily caused by panic buying at the beginning of lockdown, causing shock in the supply chain cadence. The other aspect of food security issue is attributed to food availability and socioeconomic problems resulting from loss of income. On sustainability, there are fears that control measures such as packaging (increased use of plastic), cleaning chemicals, waste and sanitisation of space to maintain hygiene as required for covid-19 can undermine the gains towards preserving the environment.}

abstract = {This paper offers a legal perspective on the phenomenon of shadow banning: content moderation sanctions which are undetectable to those affected. Drawing on recent social science research, it connects current concerns about shadow banning to novel visibility management techniques in content moderation, such as delisting and demotion. Conventional moderation techniques such as outright content removal or account suspension can be observed by those affected, but these new visibility often cannot. This lends newfound significance to the legal question of moderation transparency rights. The EU Digital Services Act (DSA) is analysed in this light, as the first major legislation to regulate transparency of visibility remedies. In effect, its due process framework prohibits shadow banning with only limited exceptions. In doing so, the DSA surfaces tensions between two competing models for content moderation: as rule-bound administration or as adversarial security conflict. I discuss possible interpretations and trade-offs for this regime, and then turn to a more fundamental problem: how to define visibility reduction as a category of content moderation actions. The concept of visibility reduction or ‘demotions’ is central to both the shadow banning imaginary and to the DSA's safeguards, but its meaning is far from straightforward. Responding to claims that demotion is entirely relative, and therefore not actionable as a category of content moderation sanctions, I show how visibility reduction can still be regulated when defined as ex post adjustments to engagement-based relevance scores. Still, regulating demotion in this way will not cover all exercises of ranking power, since it manifests not only in individual cases of moderation but also through structural acts of content curation; not just by reducing visibility, but by producing visibility.}

However, for non-ingested products (e.g., dishwashing liquid), contamination inferences are observed for store messiness but not for human crowding. Further, role of perceived scarcity is examined which suggests that in ingestible product category perception of scarcity can mitigate the negative effect of contamination on purchase intention.}

The trend towards spot markets and digitalization in hinterland intermodal transportation gives rise to online synchromodal transportation problems. This paper investigates a dynamic shipment matching problem in which a centralized platform provides online matches between shipment requests and transport services. We propose a rolling horizon approach to handle newly arrived shipment requests and develop a heuristic algorithm to generate timely solutions at each decision epoch. The experiment results demonstrate the solution accuracy and computational efficiency of the heuristic algorithm in comparison to an exact algorithm. The proposed rolling horizon approach outperforms a greedy approach from practice in total costs under various scenarios of the system.}

abstract = {Session-based recommendation aims to predict next item based on users’ anonymous behavior sequence within a short time. Recent studies focus on modeling sequential dependencies or complex relations among items in a session via recurrent/convolutional/graph neural networks. However, the following problems still remain: for short sessions, limited interactions cannot manifest user’s intent clearly; for long sessions, user’s interest may drift but be blurred by complex transitions. Motivated by the observation that different items are often belong to only a few categories or that closely related, in this article, we tackle these challenges by leveraging item category information, which is a concise form of knowledge and readily available in many platforms. We propose a novel method CaSe4SR that utilizes category sequence graph to augment session-based recommendation. In CaSe4SR, we build an item graph and a category graph, from user behavior sequence and item category sequence. The latter summarizes the former at concept level, which reduces item-level user behavior noises and makes user’s interest clearer. Afterwards, graph neural networks are applied on item graph and category graph respectively to learn representations of items and categories. Then two alternative fusion strategies and attention mechanism are designed to integrate them, yielding global embedding of the session, which is further combined with representation of last item to get ultimate session representation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that CaSe4SR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods consistently. Detailed analysis reveals that category sequence graph is beneficial for next-item recommendation in sessions with different lengths.}

In particular, they ignore the unique graph structure for information propagation and thus fail to fully explore the potentials of GCN. To tackle the problem, we propose a GCN-based self-training approach, called STL, which exploits the learning results in the training procedure, and the potential relations in the embedding space of GCN. First, to handle the data sparsity, we modify the interaction graph structure by adding edges linking a selected part of users and their potential positive items. Second, we adaptively expand the set of positive samples that are used in the pairwise loss function, which not only supplements the dataset but also avoids sampling noises. Further, similarity of structural neighbors on graph is used to mine hard negative sample for improving the sample quality. Experiments on three representative GCN-based recommenders and four widely used public datasets show that STL alleviates the problem of data sparsity, thereby improving recommendation performance compared to normal training.}

Its sheer numbers, together with social and environmental sustainability concerns, and the move towards digitalization of customer-centric operations, make the fashion business a prime target for Decision Support Systems (DSSs). On the other hand, decision support in fashion retail is particularly problematic and embraces all major supply chain domains. Decisions in an online fashion retail supply chain (FRSC) are highly dependent on time-varying customers' preferences and product availability, often leading to a combinatorial explosion. To address such a problem, DSSs could greatly benefit from high-quality information stored in customer models (CMs), constructed by using Artificial Intelligence techniques, allowing informed decisions on how to personalize (adapt) to match the customer's needs and preferences. Combinations of CMs with recommender systems (RSs) have been increasingly utilized in fashion e-commerce to provide personalized product recommendations. Nevertheless, works on enhancing CMs for e-commerce or other decision-making chain domains are scanty. This paper offers a systematic review of the literature on fashion CMs with applications to decision-making in FRSCs, mining topics for a research agenda. Research on the theme is relevant and urgent for the fashion business, which is still in its infancy. Work on the agenda topics could benefit distinct fashion stakeholders, not just customers, and produce well-grounded decision-making in varied FRSC contexts and dynamics.}

Through a service-dominant logic lens, this paper examines the effects of perceived personalization when using augmented reality (AR) and web-based stores on customers’ intentions to co-create value. We utilize an experimental design whereby participants would either use the IKEA Place AR application or visit the IKEA website. This is then followed by a survey to a) compare AR and website-based shopping attitudes, b) explore the role of personalization on intentions to co-create as well as the moderating influence of perceived value and c) investigate the mediating influence of customer perceived trust and risk on the relationship between perceived personalization and intention to co-create. Employing SEM, our findings show that perceived personalization significantly predicts value co-creation intention for website-based shopping, but not for AR-powered shopping. Additionally, the results show that trust and risk mediate the relationship between perceived personalization and intention to co-create value within the AR group with perceived value moderating the relationship between perceived personalization and risk, but not between personalization and trust. Our study is one of the first to explore the impact of personalization on intentions to co-create value and to compare perceptions of personalization between shopping through web-based stores and AR technology. Moreover, the results of this study highlight the importance of perceived risk, perceived trust, and perceived value, on customer intention to co-create. The practical implications for these findings assist managers in developing omnichannel marketing strategies while the theoretical implications contribute to the AR, technology, and co-creation literature by offering insights into the unique role of perceived personalization on AR technology and web-based store shopping via website-based retailing.}

At the same time, online sales have put to the test the enforcement of traditional VAT/GST rules, thus resulting in a higher risk of tax evasion and fraud. These types of risk are mainly associated with the qualification of taxable persons, the nature of transactions (C2C or B2C) and imports of low-value goods. The OECD has recently highlighted the potential role that platforms can play in the effective enforcement of VAT/GST rules in the e-commerce context. The OECD suggests the possibility to make e-commerce marketplaces liable for the VAT/GST on sales made through their platforms and other measures such as data sharing and enhanced co-operation between tax authorities and online marketplaces. However, even before the release of this OECD report States around the world had already started to consider how to involve platforms in the effective VAT/GST enforcement. A comparative analysis of the legislations adopted in the UK, Germany, Australia and of the EU VAT e-commerce package aims at individuating which are the main benefits and limits of such new provisions. As it emerges, even if there is room for improvement, provisions strengthening the role of platforms for VAT/GST enforcement are in any case a valuable measure for States to adopt in order to create a level playing field for businesses and protect States’ revenue.}

These audience-consumers were also engaging extensively (most on a daily basis) during the broadcast period with series related influencer social media activities on a second screen. A structural equation model was developed to analyse the data. Findings indicate that TV series audience consumers who are also highly engaged with influencer- consumer ‘second screen’ content are likely to experience positive narrative involvement leading to engagement in parasocial interaction behaviours and ultimately impulse buying behaviour. These findings have implications for managers by providing insights into (1) the effects of influencer second screen content (2) the processes by which consumers’ involvement in a TV show’s narrative leads to impulse buying of products. Thus, influencer related second screen consumer engagement should be considered a significant opportunity for marketers, as such activity makes consumers become more involved in the characters and the narrative of a particular TV show, leading to increased impulse buying.}

abstract = {Driverless cars or autonomous vehicles (AV) have become topic of debate in various forums for both governments and academia. A lot of research is focused on the technical aspects dealing with what technologies will be needed in order to achieve completely driverless traffic. Less investigated are the effects that this technology will have on our cities and the future mobility. Autonomy along with electrification and sharing is likely to change the face of individual transport in next three decades. This paper tries to understand and foresee the changes in mobility behavior through a scenario building exercise. Various topics that relate to mobility and cities are analyzed based on available researches. The aim of the research is focus on the way this technology can impact our urban environments and set the base for policy changes at different levels. Planners, Policy and car makers and other new stakeholders need to take a holistic and multi-disciplinary approach in understanding and assessing the effect this technology will have in our lives and cities.}

This paper focuses on two challenges traditional GNN frameworks face: (i) most of them are transductive and mainly concentrate on homogeneous networks considering single typed nodes and edges; (ii) they are difficult to handle the real-time changing network structures as well as scale to big graph data. To address these issues, a novel attention-based Heterogeneous Multi-view Graph Neural Network (aHMGNN) solution is introduced. aHMGNN models a more intricate heterogeneous multi-view network, where various node and edge types co-exist and each of these objects also contain specific attributes. It is end-to-end, and two stages are designed for node embeddings learning and multi-typed node and edge representations fusion, respectively. Experimental studies on large-scale spam detection and link prediction tasks clearly verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed aHMGNN. Furthermore, we have implemented our approach in one of the largest e-commerce platforms which further verifies that aHMGNN is arguably promising and scalable in real-world applications.}

However, they rarely utilize the power of social networking to assist a fundraiser in discovering potential donors, and this is especially true for small organizations and individuals. In this research, we propose a recommendation mechanism for social fundraising that analyzes the donor's preferences, the relationship between the donor and fundraiser, and the characteristics of the fundraising dynamics to promote the spread of philanthropic fundraising. The proposed mechanism can effectively discover appropriate donors and relevant campaigns to expedite the fundraising process and improve its success rate.}

Blockchain Technologies promised to bring about decentralized trust having the potential to disrupt digital ecosystems by providing alternatives to centralized storage and management of data. This has the potential to radically transform industries and services through new models of data storage, transparency, tracking, payment systems amongst other advantages. However, Blockchain Technology is designed to provide other Value Propositions beyond decentralized storage, such as innovative crypto economic and investment models and radical new forms of decentralized participative governance models that could lead to the evolution of new generation of Digital Platforms and multi stakeholder business interactions. In this paper, through a systematic literature review, we present a set of key Blockchain Value Propositions and a discussion on how it can complement to the evolution of Digital Platforms and the Collaborative Economy. We also argue that while some of the value propositions are easier to integrate with existing Digital Platforms, more disruptive value propositions such as Business Automation, Economic and Governance Models present greater challenges but could lead to not just innovation at the technological level, but also metamorphosis of the existing social, economic and governance models.}

The main challenge is to mine reliable textual consumer opinions, and automatically use them to rate the best products or brands. We propose a framework to automatically analyse these reviews, transforming negative and positive user opinions in a quantitative score. Sentiment analysis was employed to analyse online reviews on Amazon. The Fake Review Detection Framework—FRDF— detects and removes fake reviews using Natural Language Processing technology. The FRDF was tested on reviews of products from high-tech industries. Brands were rated according to consumer sentiment. The findings demonstrate that brand managers and consumers would find this tool useful, in combination with the 5-Star score, for more comprehensive decision-making. For instance, the FRDF ranks the best products by price alongside their respective sentiment value and the 5-Star score.}

By utilizing the data of additional reviews (ARs), an innovative social media module for customers to express follow-up opinions that complement their initial reviews, we examine the impact of MR treatment on the customers' AR valence. We leverage the insight that the observability of MR at the time of the responded customer posts an AR is a crucial condition to the impact of the MR, and thus regard the observability of MR as an exogenous treatment for model identification. Fixed effects models with extensive control variables are proposed to estimate the MR treatment effects. The results show that MRs have significant positive impacts on customers' satisfaction in ARs. Further explorations show that the positive impacts are mainly due to the positive effects of MRs on nonpositive initial reviews (MR-Ns), suggesting that MR-Ns are an effective management tool for customer complaints. Moreover, this study identifies MR delay as a boundary condition for the internality of MRs because MR delay negatively moderates the positive impacts of MRs. Therefore, companies should promptly respond to customers' negative opinions in their reviews. This study is among the very first to clearly identify the internality of MRs on the responded customers’ satisfaction. We show that the existing results on the externality of MRs are not directly applicable to the internality of MRs, highlighting the novelty of this study. The obtained new insights provide practical guidelines for companies to adjust their intervention strategies on e-commerce platforms.}

Most of the existing frameworks, be it Matrix Factorisation model, Deep learning-based model, Factorisation Machines and Two tower recommendation models, used in real world recommendation engines lack diversity and serendipity. Also, cold start problem is one that downgrade the recommendation algorithm. Defining the optimisation goal and closed feedback improvement loop is also something that is not given primary weightage. To overcome the above stated challenges and provide a novel approach to overcome those, we propose the AFETLER model. AFETLER incorporates an adaptive fusion technique that dynamically combines recommendations from several sources such as new arrivals forecast, Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, and popularity estimation. This fusion technique improves accuracy by giving varying weights to each source based on the user's context, history preferences, and current behaviour, resulting in highly relevant and tailored buying recommendations. To address the cold-start problem and improve recommendations for new items, AFETLER employs a transfer learning mechanism inspired by the Adversarial Two-tower Neural Network (ATNN) framework, utilizing knowledge from existing items' interactions to extract valuable features from new items' profiles. Furthermore, AFETLER leverages hierarchical attention methods to effectively capture user-item interaction patterns, boosting feature extraction and overall recommendation quality through dynamic weighing of interaction relevance. Proposed AFETLER model outperforms some of the existing recommendation models by an average 2%-5% on metrics such a precision, ROC-AUC, and Top-K recommendation accuracy. Further, we also see point reduction in Mean absolute error and mean squared error.}

Information facets, such as equivocality and veracity, can dominate and significantly influence human perceptions of information and consequently affect human performance. Extant research in cognitive fit, which preceded the big data and AI era, focused on the effects of aligning information representation and task on performance, without sufficient consideration to information facets and attendant cognitive challenges. Therefore, there is a compelling need to understand the interplay of these dominant information facets with information representations and tasks, and their influence on human performance. We suggest that artificially intelligent technologies that can adapt information representations to overcome cognitive limitations are necessary for these complex information environments. To this end, we propose and test a novel “Adaptive Cognitive Fit” (ACF) framework that explains the influence of information facets and AI-augmented information representations on human performance. We draw on information processing theory and cognitive dissonance theory to advance the ACF framework and a set of propositions. We empirically validate the ACF propositions with an economic experiment that demonstrates the influence of information facets, and a machine learning simulation that establishes the viability of using AI to improve human performance.}

Using four scenarios describing situations with potential privacy trade-offs, we conducted a focus group study with 8 groups of participants (N = 32). Our results suggest that factors influencing privacy trade-offs go beyond existing TA factors alone. A technology's perceived usefulness plays an important role, as well as dimensions related to context, previous experiences, perceived autonomy and the feeling of control over the data being shared.}

In parts-to-picker systems, automated vehicles or cranes bring the parts to a human picker. The storage assignment policy, the assignment of products to the storage locations, influences order picking efficiency. Commonly used storage assignment policies, such as full turnover-based and class-based storage, only consider the frequency at which each product has been requested but ignore information on the frequency at which products are ordered jointly, known as product affinity. Warehouses can use product affinity to make informed decisions and assign multiple correlated products to the same inventory “pod” to reduce retrieval time. Existing affinity-based assignments sequentially cluster products with high affinity and assign the clusters to storage locations. We propose an integrated cluster allocation (ICA) policy to minimize the retrieval time of parts-to-picker systems based on both product turnover and affinity obtained from historical customer orders. We formulate a mathematical model that can solve small instances and develop a greedy construction heuristic for solving large instances. The ICA storage policy can reduce total retrieval time by up to 40% compared to full turnover-based storage and class-based policies. The model is validated using a real warehouse dataset and tested against uncertainties in customer demand and for different travel time models.}

This paper studies how an O2O platform can attract physical (offline) grocery retailers through pricing and market expansion, and customers by providing shopping convenience and home-delivery. We analyze both when the O2O platform has self-scheduling delivery capacity and when it does not. We find that two widely used pricing schemes—revenue sharing and fixed fee—are equivalent. If the O2O platform does not itself have any self-scheduling delivery capacity, it outsources home-delivery service to a delivery platform, which may result in incentive misalignment. We find that it is not always necessary for the O2O platform to coordinate the decentralized system. Under some conditions, the decentralized system will yield higher profit than the centralized system due to the risk protection effect. If coordination is needed, we propose subsidy contracts for the O2O platform to align its and the delivery platform’s objectives.}

As a response, many governments have introduced mandatory notification schemes in which an entity bears an obligation to notify the regulator and affected individuals if personal data it holds is compromised. Focusing on Australia’s Notifiable Data Breach (NDB) scheme introduced in 2018, this paper points out that the NDB scheme gives entities that should be responsible for data protection much leeway while holding individuals, only victims of a data breach, responsible for dealing with the consequences. This is problematic as redressing the grievances caused by a data breach is difficult in the Australian context. It is difficult for a victim of a breach of privacy to bring an action in court mainly because there is no established tort of privacy in Australia. Further, bringing a class action for data breaches is a difficult process. We suggest that the real effect of the NDB scheme requires an understanding in a broader context of Australian Privacy Principles (APPs). Regulated in a broader APPs context, the NDB scheme could become a part of a privacy protection regime that requires public agencies and businesses to have better accountability and responsibility mechanisms.}

Drawing upon the S-O-R framework, we propose a model that explains the intention to reuse AR-based apps. The results of a study involving 224 participants suggest that the relationship between perceived augmentation and consumers’ behavioural intention is fostered by a mediation pattern combining three interrelated cognitive factors, namely, sense of immersion, product presence and perceived realism. The results reveal the importance of perceived realism to encourage adoption of this means of shopping by creating a favourable attitude towards mobile shopping, which, in turn, convinces consumers to reuse such shopping apps.}

Empirical research suggests that these information sources complement each other by providing a clear picture of firm performance, but remains silent on the role of additional textual content that continues to emerge and reach more potential investors on the web. We build on this line of research to examine the effect of textual content from business journals in conjunction with summary measures on cumulative abnormal returns. We use sentiment analysis with machine learning and econometrics methods to examine content extracted from textual articles about S&P 500 index companies that are published in the Wall Street Journal (years 2013–2016). Textual analysis of business journals in conjunction with quantitative measures revealed direct and interaction effects on abnormal returns over time. We also tested for robustness by replicating the analysis with different variable operationalization and observe consistent patterns. Relative to positive sentiments, negative sentiments have more profound effects on cumulative abnormal returns. The effect of positive sentiments becomes weaker when past quantitative measures are high. As information sources continue to emerge on the web, this work makes key contributions to the practice of sentiment analysis in financial markets.}

abstract = {The architecture of the Internet is changing. A novel expansive construction of communication and making available to the public has been shaking the Internet ecosystem. It reaches into basic online activities, such as linking. Departing from well-established international approaches, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has recently decided a multitude of cases that redesigned the notion of communication to the public in the Internet, while discussing linking activities in particular. This jurisprudence stands against a fluid legal framework searching for the optimal allocation of intermediary liability of information service providers. Communication to the public is at the centre stage of this legislative process as well. EU copyright legislative reform makes Online Content Sharing Service Providers (OCSSP)—the large majority of UGC platforms—communicating to the public. In doing so, the Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive changes the fundamental rules under which online platforms operate and UGC content is created for a large portion of the connected world. This, in turn, is forcing online intermediaries to remodel the architecture of the Internet accordingly. Proactive filtering—rather than ex post review of allegedly infringing content and links—is set to become the first commandment governing the Internet of tomorrow.}

In fact, during the crisis numerous digital redesigns of businesses occurred to pursue both continuity and competitive advantage. Among these, the food retail sector has undergone under the pressure of the crisis intense digital changes, which, however, have not yet been investigated under the theoretical lens of BMI. To fill this gap, the paper analyzes the digital actions taken during the pandemic crisis by two large food retailers, namely Walmart and Carrefour. Covering a wide temporal interval of the pandemic evolution and reviewing multiple geographical markets, the authors interpreted the grocer's digital responses to the crisis in terms of innovation in value creation and capture mechanisms. As a result, three phases of digital BMI have been reconstructed, each characterized by specific mechanisms of value creation and capture experienced by the two grocers during the pandemic. Leveraging these findings, the paper proposes a model capable of defining how digital BMI takes place in response to crises. Results broaden theoretical knowledge and practical suggestions on digital BMI in terms of enabling factors, actionable value mechanisms, and future business opportunities.}

This study employs a game-theoretic framework to investigate the dynamics of a manufacturer establishing a business ecosystem by collaborating with a partner on a supply chain platform. The partner, in turn, offers complementary products to consumers, thereby fostering a symbiotic relationship within the ecosystem. Motivated by the need to understand the implications of such business ecosystems, this study explores their effects on firms operating in the competitive market. Additionally, we examine the impacts of two distinct advertising strategies: product-focused and platform-oriented advertising strategies. Our analytical results reveal several interesting findings. First, forming a business ecosystem based on a supply chain platform increases profits for both the manufacturer and the partner. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that the manufacturer should selectively adopt a platform-oriented advertising strategy based on the magnitude of the platform advertising effect. Moreover, we uncover that the partner’s product-focused advertising strategy fosters a win-win outcome for all firms in the market, ensuring economic sustainability, particularly in the face of intermediate-level market competition. This research provides insightful recommendations for understanding the dynamics of the supply chain, shedding light on the strategic decisions and advertising strategies that drive efficiency within such ecosystems.}

This problem is widely recognized as the exploration/exploitation (EE) dilemma, and the multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithm has proven to be an effective solution. As the scale of users and items in real-world application scenarios increases, their purchase interactions become sparser. Then three issues need to be investigated when building MAB-based recommender systems. First, large-scale users and sparse interactions increase the difficulty of user preference mining. Second, traditional bandits model items as arms and cannot deal with ever-growing items effectively. Third, widely used Bernoulli-based reward mechanisms only feedback 0 or 1, ignoring rich implicit feedback such as behaviors like click and add-to-cart. To address these problems, we propose an algorithm named Dynamic Clustering based Contextual Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandits (DC3MAB), which consists of three configurable key components. Specifically, a dynamic user clustering strategy enables different users in the same cluster to cooperate in estimating the expected rewards of arms. A dynamic item partitioning approach based on collaborative filtering significantly reduces the scale of arms and produces a recommendation list instead of one item to provide diversity. In addition, a multi-class reward mechanism based on fine-grained implicit feedback helps better capture user preferences. Extensive empirical experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DC3MAB over state-of-the-art bandits (On average, +75.8% in F1 and +54.3% in cumulative reward).

Significant tensions tend to arise across this gap. However, the data-driven experimentation, and the organizational capabilities developed within the firm, increase the ability of the company to foster technological forecasting and business model innovation. It is argued within this paper, that growth hacking actually mitigates these tensions. This paper is a critical review complemented with insights from practitioners and an illustrative case, the purpose of which is to: a) shed light on what growth hacking is; b) give practical tips on how to implement growth hacking. In achieving the first goal, the paper unravels the following myths. First, growth hacking is not a framework for platforms and high-tech companies only. Second, it is not only a marketing strategy and third, that growth hacking is a predefined process. These issues are traced back to two flawed assumptions underlying growth hacking; namely that (a) it is a framework designed for start-ups only and (b) that a “one size fits all” approach to growth hacking is appropriate. By unravelling those issues and combining these observations we shall provide ground for a fundamentally different approach to growth hacking, designed for business model scalability, enabled for adaptability in a changing business environment and focused throughout on the effective management of a firm's resources and capabilities. These insights shall guide scholars towards a better understanding of the phenomenon and of the two waves that characterize its evolution, providing also promising future research avenues. Moreover, the implications drawn from the discussion shall help managers in guiding their journey from strategy definition to strategy implementation.}

However, the following challenges need to be addressed: (1) the hierarchy of item transition patterns is overlooked; (2) existing works fail to distinguish various factors of item transition within a single session for disentangling user intents. To cope with the above challenges, we propose a novel session based recommendation model called Self-supervised Dual Hypergraph learning with Intent Disentanglement model (SDHID). Specifically, we first propose a disentangled capsule hypergraph convolutional channel for ne-grained intent learning to capture the intra-session pattern. Accordingly, we introduce the hypergraph and capsule networks in disentangling to learn the item embedding for different factors, and then the representation of the intra-session pattern is obtained by aggregating item embedding with attention weights. Moreover, we build a novel dual–primal hypergraph convolutional channel by mapping the hypergraph to a dual–primal graph for learning the item transition pattern of inter-session. In addition, the above two channels are combined into a self-supervised contrastive learning framework by maximizing mutual information between the learned session representations. We unify the recommendation and the self-supervised tasks under a primary and auxiliary learning framework. The combined optimization of two tasks leads to a hierarchical joint learning item transition for intra- and inter-session. Extensive experiments on real datasets show that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art models.}

This feature makes agent-based systems naturally suitable to address the challenges in Supply Chain Management (SCM). Although agent-based supply chains systems have been proposed since the early 2000s; industrial uptake of them has been lagging. The reasons quoted include the immaturity of technology, a lack of interoperability with supply chain information systems, and a lack of trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this paper, we revisit the agent-based supply chain and review the state of the art. We find that agent-based technology has matured, and other supporting technologies that are penetrating supply chains; are filling in gaps, leaving the concept applicable to a wider range of functions. For example, the ubiquity of IoT technology helps agents “sense” the state of affairs in a supply chain and opens up new possibilities for automation. Digital ledgers help securely transfer data between third parties, making agent-based information sharing possible, without the need to integrate Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Learning functionality in agents enables agents to move beyond automation and towards autonomy. We note this convergence effect through conceptualising an agent-based supply chain framework, reviewing its components, and highlighting research challenges that need to be addressed in moving forward.}

To address this challenge, we conduct an exploratory qualitative study based on 20 interviews with providers and customers of cloud computing services, supplemented by data from observations. Our research highlights critical touchpoints along the customer journey in cloud computing markets and provides implications for B2B customer journey management. A key finding is that B2B customers' IT competency is a crucial differentiator in this market. That is, while IT-savvy companies evaluate these services independently and use them in a self-service fashion, IT-novice companies rely on multipliers (e.g., IT system houses) to act as support and gatekeepers to buying cloud computing services. This difference has implications for the composition of buying and usage centers, the development of the customer journey, and the control of touchpoints by the service provider. Thus, cloud service providers need to manage two types of customer journey: one directly focused on customers and another involving the management of multipliers. Based on these findings, we offer recommendations for B2B practitioners to guide their customers through the journey for this complex digital service.}

However, like most workflow systems, it coordinates the workflow centrally, and cannot run within more transient environments where nodes are mobile. To address this gap, we show how Node-RED workflows can be migrated into a decentralized execution environment for operation on mobile ad-hoc networks, and we demonstrate this by converting a Node-RED based traffic congestion detection workflow to operate in a decentralized environment. The approach uses a Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) to dynamically convert Node-Red applications into a compact semantic vector representation that encodes the service interfaces and the workflow in which they are embedded. By extending existing services interfaces, with a simple cognitive layer that can interpret and exchange the vectors, we show how the required services can be dynamically discovered and interconnected into the required workflow in a completely decentralized manner. The resulting system provides a convenient environment where the Node-RED front-end graphical composition tool can be used to orchestrate decentralized workflows. In this paper, we further extend this work by introducing a new dynamic VSA vector compression scheme that compresses vectors for on-the-wire communication, thereby reducing communication bandwidth while maintaining the semantic information content. This algorithm utilizes the holographic properties of the symbolic vectors to perform compression taking into consideration the number of combined vectors along with similarity bounds that determine conflict with other encoded vectors used in the same context. The resulting savings make this approach extremely efficient for discovery in service based decentralized workflows.}

It has become a global frontrunner in many sectors, including commerce, finance, and entertainment. A comprehensive law and policy narrative, however, is largely absent from English academic literature. This paper seeks to fill this gap by analysing the dynamic relationship of industrial development, policy engagement and regulation construction in one of the prime sectors of platform economy: Electronic Commerce (E-commerce). China's E-commerce market rose to global dominance shortly after its origination in the mid-1990s. This paper holds that such an expeditious ascendency is nourished by carefully designed public policies. To implement these policies, also to redress information asymmetries and other pertinacious market failures, a tailored regulatory paradigm has been instigated. This regulatory paradigm manifests a new mode of polycentric, participatory, and collaborative governance that strives to balance interest disparities between various stakeholders. The dynamic relationship exemplified in China's E-commerce market would provide a valuable indication for administering other sectors of platform economy not only in China but also across other jurisdictions that openly embrace commercial innovations in the context of information technological transformation.}

abstract = {The metaverse has the potential to extend the physical world using augmented and virtual reality technologies allowing users to seamlessly interact within real and simulated environments using avatars and holograms. Virtual environments and immersive games (such as, Second Life, Fortnite, Roblox and VRChat) have been described as antecedents of the metaverse and offer some insight to the potential socio-economic impact of a fully functional persistent cross platform metaverse. Separating the hype and “meta…” rebranding from current reality is difficult, as “big tech” paints a picture of the transformative nature of the metaverse and how it will positively impact people in their work, leisure, and social interaction. The potential impact on the way we conduct business, interact with brands and others, and develop shared experiences is likely to be transformational as the distinct lines between physical and digital are likely to be somewhat blurred from current perceptions. However, although the technology and infrastructure does not yet exist to allow the development of new immersive virtual worlds at scale - one that our avatars could transcend across platforms, researchers are increasingly examining the transformative impact of the metaverse. Impacted sectors include marketing, education, healthcare as well as societal effects relating to social interaction factors from widespread adoption, and issues relating to trust, privacy, bias, disinformation, application of law as well as psychological aspects linked to addiction and impact on vulnerable people. This study examines these topics in detail by combining the informed narrative and multi-perspective approach from experts with varied disciplinary backgrounds on many aspects of the metaverse and its transformational impact. The paper concludes by proposing a future research agenda that is valuable for researchers, professionals and policy makers alike.}

abstract = {Thirty three of the 55 African countries have enacted data privacy laws since 2001. This paper analyses two types of potential legal influences on these national laws: standards and obligations originating from outside Africa (international); and those developed within Africa, both at the continental (African Union) level, and at the level of Regional Economic Communities (RECs). Analysis commences with which countries have laws or Bills, and constitutional requirements International influences are shown to be indirect, with only slight UN influences, but with accessions by African countries to data protection Convention 108 significant in converting it into a global Convention. EU influences are also indirect (aspirational) with both the DPD and the GDPR perceived as standards to be emulated in African instruments. Of African multilateral agreements, the African Union's data protection and cybercrime Convention (2014) is yet of limited influence because it is not in force. In contrast, the ECOWAS Supplementary Act (2010) has been of considerable practical influence in West Africa. The HIPPSA ‘Model Acts’ with higher standards (particularly SADC Model Law, 2013) remain of potential influence in other regions of sub-Saharan Africa. European instruments are presented as typifying ‘three generations’ of development of data privacy laws (exemplified by (i) Convention 108, 1980; (ii) EU DPD, 1995; and (iii) EU GDPR, 2016 plus Convention 108+, 2018). The three main African multilateral instruments (ECOWAS Act, AU Convention, SADC Model Law) are compared with them, as well as between themselves. These comparisons enable conclusions to be drawn, some of which are as follows. The African regional framework does not display any Africa-specific approach to data protection. Less individualist and more communitarian African culture or human rights discourse is absent from the texts of these laws. Drafters of the African instruments seem to accept, tacitly or expressly the necessity to be consistent with other international texts, in particular European instruments. They have adopted many ‘2nd generation’ DPD elements but have anticipated relatively few of the ‘third generation’ GDPR standards. Sub-regional agreements (ECOWAS Act and model laws) have provided a means to move forward despite the lack of progress in bring the regional AU convention into force.}
