abstract = {Sustainable development poses a grand challenge for society, addressed by organisations through their public relations activities. Grand challenges are complex by nature and call for nontrivial solutions whose effects show at the level of society. That is why studying public relations’ contribution to grand challenges requires a macro perspective that accounts for the dynamic interaction between individual, organisational, and system levels in a digital communication environment. This paper offers a new paradigm to analyse organisations’ significant and at times undue impact on grand challenges through public relations. It develops a framework inspired by complex adaptive systems thinking and adopts its ten properties for public relations: emergence, adaptivity, heterogeneous actors, nonlinear effects, feedback mechanisms, self-organisation, phase transitions, networks, scaling, and cooperation. The paper applies the framework to the example of sustainable development. It shows why research on grand challenges requires a holistic perspective and how it can help study digitally born communication phenomena. The proposed complex systems paradigm provides space for critical, social scientific, and interpretative research lines in public relations. Inquiries start from the grand challenge and study the communicative interactions between organisations and other actors from existing theory while accounting for the ten properties of complex adaptive systems. The paper outlines how future research can enrich the study of public relations and discusses its limits.}

abstract = {While data, digital analytics, and technology have the possibility of further elevating public relations to a strategic function, many communicators cite barriers, including that many on their teams lack digital data and analytics competency. Researchers interviewed 28 senior-level communicators who have experience working with digital data and analytics. The study sought to examine how communicators are adapting to and leading teams in this data revolution by exploring two primary research questions: (1) What are the perceived opportunities and challenges with digital data and analytics? and (2) How can communicators create an environment to encourage discovery and innovation connected to digital data and analytics? Participants described the challenges of managing vast data streams and alignment, staying current with digital trends and technology, and dealing with the shortcoming of AI tools and algorithms. When asked about opportunities, participants described how communicators are uniquely positioned to align data and analytics efforts to help them understand audiences, foster mutually beneficial relationships with publics, and share stories with these publics and senior counsel that contribute to organizational objectives. Participants said they develop data competency among their communication teams by fostering a creative and curious culture, creating diverse teams, and championing employees. In summary, this study expands understanding of how communicators can evolve and lead in an increasingly data-driven world.}

Although self-regulation as a research topic has been well-researched, systematic literature reviews on this domain are rare. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this article is one of the first to present a systematic literature review on self-regulation and goal-directed behavior. The authors compiled a study pool of 78 papers over a period of 1990–2021. This study complements the Theory, Characteristics, Context, and Methodology (TCCM) framework, and presents the TCCMP framework to provide public policy recommendations. Further, the authors extract seminal models in the self-regulation literature to re-integrate them into contemporary marketing research. Through the insights gained from the literature review, this paper presents suggestions for public policies, and develops a detailed research agenda.}

A theories-in-use approach, building on 56 interviews with managers at 36 B2B companies that have invested heavily in DCM, advances current literature by developing an activity-based conceptualization, grounded in relevant marketing research streams (customer engagement, customer journey and marketing technology literature). The authors also empirically derive propositions about the key contingencies of DCM performance. This conceptualization and the related contingencies provide an actionable roadmap for effective implementation of DCM for managers in business markets.}

After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 276 articles from 2006 to 2017 were collected as the final sample. Public Relations Review has published the most articles, while the most commonly used theories were agenda setting /building theory, rhetorical theory, and framing theory. Media relations articles utilize qualitative methodologies more than quantitative ones, while the commonly used data analytical tools were content analysis, interview, survey, and case study. Our analysis of the discussed regions and geospatial distribution of first-author show that the North American, European, and Asian continents and the US, the UK, China, and Australia have relatively more publications. The majority of media relations articles discussed governmental organizations. Five themes dominated media relations articles: public relations strategy, media relations practice, mass media and journalism, state–media relations, and organizational media relations.}

We take a network perspective to examine the construction of knowledge of engagement in the public relations literature.

Using two bibliometric analysis techniques, we reveal and assess the connections among scholars, theories, concepts, and engagement types to inform future researchers’ scholarly endeavors into engagement.}

The core of the paper is a systematic review of interdisciplinary research on greenwashing in the B2B context with a focus on B2B marketing implications. In particular, this study contributes to a modern understanding of greenwashing by providing a new framework for the typology, drivers, and consequences of greenwashing. It also contrasts theories that help explain the greenwashing phenomenon through an interdisciplinary perspective. Finally, this study points out the gaps in existing research on this phenomenon and offers rich future research directions.}

In order to understand whether the PR profession is undergoing a major or just a minor change, this study focuses on expert attitudes toward the disruptions and the perceived change of their identity, strategy, and structure of PR. The analysis of semi-structured in-depth interviews yielded six themes: changes that are shaping the industry, changes in organizational identity, occupational definitions and roles, structural aspects, the difference between PR communication strategy and digital PR-strategy, new methods, tools, and measurement models and finally predictions for the future. Three main conclusions arise from these themes: PR agency self-identity is in a process of change from media-relations to strategic consultants; the main source of the change is perceived as media disruption rather than digital disruption (although they are interrelated); and the future in PR is predicted as the all-in-one marketing communications agency, which might develop into a new, hybrid, profession.}

DivPSM is trained to identify whether a post makes mention of diversity or a diversity-related issue, and to subsequently code for the presence of three diversity dimensions (cultural/ethnic/racial, gender, and LHGBTQ+ diversity) and three diversity perspectives (the moral, market, and innovation perspectives). In Study 1, we describe the training and validation of the instrument, and examine how it performs compared to human coders. Our findings confirm that DivPSM is sufficiently reliable for use in future research. In study 2, we illustrate the type of data that DivPSM generates, by analyzing the prevalence of strategic diversity communication in social media posts (n = 84,561) of large organizations in the Netherlands. Our results show that in this context gender diversity is most prevalent, followed by LHGBTQ+ and cultural/ethnic/racial diversity. Furthermore, gender diversity is often associated with the innovation perspective, whereas LHGBTQ+ diversity is more often associated with the moral perspective. Cultural/ethnic/racial diversity does not show strong associations with any of the perspectives. Theoretical implications and directions for future research are discussed at the end of the paper.}

A mixed-methods research design is applied, grounded in three complementary studies (a qualitative study [27 in-depth interviews], an online survey [241 participants], and a follow-up online survey [101 participants]). Findings suggest that: (a) the firm-level outcomes of MDS are financial and customer performance, organizational reputation, and sustained competitive advantage; (b) radical and incremental product innovation trigger MDS; (c) incremental innovation and organizational reputation are positively related to financial performance; and (d) MDS enhances market change.}

abstract = {Supply chain networks developed upon the classical exclusive ownerships are to a great extent vulnerable and penetrable. The rapid pace of change in today's globalization has made it impossible for a centralized operation to succeed in all aspects of performance. To keep up with demands in this situation, this paper proposes an approach wherein supply networks, with independent ownerships of resources, compete against each other to maximize their market share. This competition is carried out in the growth phase of supply networks which are relationship-based managed under main firms’ brands. In this study, environmental sustainability is achieved through the development of a multi-agent (multi-network) distribution mechanism. Although several studies have been conducted in multi-factory manufacturing, this paper is the first attempt to develop such an environmentally sustainable shared platform in the distribution level of the network (including main firms (brands), manufacturers, governmental logistics service providers, and franchised retailers). Even more striking, the downstream members of the network (franchised stores) are to increase their monopoly interests alongside attempting to expand the overall share of the main brand. This implies a left-behind concept called virtual alliance. This problem is formulated using a mixed-integer programming model. Further, two gaming-based heuristic algorithms are prepared in the Nash and Stackelberg formulations. To evaluate the efficiency of the chosen scheme, a real-world example is considered and compared with a classical case. The obtained results illustrate a better performance of the proposed approach.}

Employing a quasi-experimental design, we analyze a national retail chain’s various featured product weekly advertisements across the transaction records of 1817 products in 225 different product categories that cover a year of sales. All three-product types had a significant moderating effect on increasing the sales volume of the featured products when placed on the interior page feature location. For example, the interior pages are often ignored unless the recipient is sufficiently interested to flip through other parts of the flyer. Placing high-priced products, low-frequency products, and highly perishable products in the interior page feature location led to advertising effectiveness. In terms of frequency, the sales volume of high-frequency products were consistently higher than low-frequency products regardless of the location. On the other hand, the front and back page are the most visible pages of a flyer. In these two most visible locations, placing products that perish quickly maximized the effectiveness of using a flyer. These results highlight the importance of considering these three product types when making retail promotion decisions, including where retailers should position featured products within advertisements.}

With its own career-defining skills, the field of public relations is no different. Knowing the demands of the industry creates an opportunity to supply the most relevant education that gets early professionals hired. By analyzing 1000 job postings, this study unearths the most frequently requested entry-level public relations job skills by employers.

The authors critically analyze the publics and OPR literature, furthering past criticisms and raising new questions about the heuristic value of OPR research. The paper points out three major weaknesses of the OPR tradition in its use of publics: (1) serious vacillation in terms resulting in conceptual inconsistencies, (2) inappropriate operationalization of variables and the use of probability sampling, and (3) a lack of insightful context and inclusion of relationship factors in OPR studies, to which publics are inextricably bound. The critique cautions scholars engaged in OPR research to improve their literature reviews and to enlarge their methodologies beyond a narrow scope of relational variables, which are theoretically fragile if not devoid of research value. Finally, the critique suggests the importance of conceptualizing publics in ways that acknowledge their agency.}

Often such discourses unravel into splintered and negative conversations, raising the question whether organizations can and should exercise some level of control and ‘steering’ in these conversations and, if so, how stakeholders would react to such ‘top down’ moderation. Existing studies lack empirical insights into the impacts of different levels of moderation in social media conversations on stakeholder attitudes. Two experimental studies were developed to test the effect of different levels of organizational moderation on stakeholder attitudes towards organizations. We show that increased levels of moderation negatively affect attitudes towards an organization, satisfaction with an organization's performance, and trust in the organization. Increased moderation also significantly undermines beliefs in the commitment of the organization to its stakeholders and control mutuality. This paper extends recent qualitative attempts to build new theory around stakeholder dialogues on social media by testing the effects of varying levels of moderation in such dialogues.}

Strategic financial communication increasingly includes intangible assets that contribute to the value of the company. At the same time, more and more companies are publishing corporate purpose statements that are intended to express their relevance. The article acknowledges those trends and aims to assess how IROs make sense of the corporate purpose and how they strategically use it in investor relations communication. Eleven qualitative in-depth interviews with IROs from German DAX40 companies were conducted and analyzed with an abductive method. The results show that IROs focus on cues when making sense of the corporate purpose, especially links to intangible assets and organizational values can be identified. The corporate purpose is only partially used in communication with the financial public. Deepened reflection on the corporate purpose, fueled by discussions and cues, supports the sensemaking process of IROs which can be guided by the organization. The role of the corporate purpose turned out to be complex with – although not always explored – the potential to be used as a descriptive and normative tool in strategic financial communication.}

This is a significant knowledge gap as SMIs can assist policymakers and healthcare professionals in reaching the general public. The present study addresses this gap by examining how Indian SMI's features and activities can influence their followers' willingness to vaccinate by employing source credibility and uses and gratification theory. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), we used cross-sectional data from 746 Indians (North capital region) to test the measurement and structural model grounded in two theoretical lenses. The results show that SMIs positively and significantly influence their followers' inclination to take the COVID-19 vaccine. This positive relationship strengthens the SMI's relationship with their followers from the COVID-19 vaccine perspective (Vaccine information and awareness). Moreover, the perceived threat of social isolation (PTSI) moderates the relationship between trust in the vaccines and the willingness to take them and promotes the understanding of anti-vaccine behaviors. Also, the study confirms the mediation role of vaccine information and awareness among features of SMI's and trust in the vaccine. This study contributes to the current literature by proposing social media influencers as the COVID-19 savior. Additionally, the moderation role of the perceived threat of social isolation (PTSI) offers unique insights into how contextual and individual factors can affect SMI followers.}

On a broader level, such politically motivated advocacy is a critical facet of civil society with important implications on the societal role of public relations (Taylor, 2010). In light of the significance of politically motivated consumer advocacy to public relations, a multi-phase, exploratory study was conducted. Study 1 applies content analysis and social network analysis to examine how different interactive mechanisms on social media—retweet, mention, and reply—may affect communication within and between communities of different ideological views surrounding the boycott and buycott issues. Study 2 further explores the challenges and opportunities of fostering exchange of diverse viewpoints by identifying new social mediators—the “echoers” who propel information flow among in-group members, and the “bridgers” who initiate communication with political out-group members—and assess the key network characteristics of these social mediators. The findings of these two studies advance public relations theories on networks, intergroup communication, and civil society by illustrating how social media structure and social mediators shape the networked public discourse to facilitate or inhibit conversations between publics of different ideological orientations.}

This study follows a qualitative empirical research design, using a new dataset based on 32 interviews with experts conducted in six international automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). To improve generalization, the perspectives of volume, premium, and entry-level manufacturers are included. The four most relevant indicators are high customer relevance, strategic fit, high communication potential, and vision potential. The data suggest the need for more flexible and faster front-end evaluation approaches.

Such offenses range from criminal acts to the public expression of controversial opinions. In response, digital activism coalesces into a socio-political force that seeks to shame, silence, or punish the offending individual. This study seeks to understand the agonistic reputational wrangle facilitated by cancel culture using an original theoretical framework that combines the rhetorical paradigm from public relations with deviance theory from sociology and media studies. Specifically, this study analyzes the cancellation and reputational repair strategies of four celebrities—Louis C.K., Logan Paul, Jussie Smollett, and J.K. Rowling. It utilizes large-scale social media sentiment analysis to reveal varying degrees of reputational decay and recovery. The study shows that factors impacting the severity of cancellation and the likelihood of reputational recovery include distinguishing between criminal acts and controversial opinions, as well as social variables and the strength of a parasocial relationship between a celebrity and their fandom.}

The research employs multiple regression analysis to assess the relationship between CSR dimensions and consumer engagement. Results reveal that two CSR dimensions (employee support and diversity) positively arouse more engagement than non-CSR-related content. Oppositely, other CSR dimensions (environment, community support, product) provide negative or non-statistically significant results compared to non-CSR-related content. This empirical study, utilizing official data from Facebook and Instagram, contributes valuable insights into consumer engagement with CSR-related posts in the banking sector, addressing both scholarly and practical needs for understanding consumer social media engagement dynamics.}

The sample included 290 peer-reviewed articles published between 1980 and 2018 across 61 communication journals. The 9,288 foundation publications and 4,596 unique publication sources referenced by these articles were also analyzed. Results of this study reveal limited collaborations among researchers with expertise in and outside the communication discipline or across different communication sub-disciplines. The results also show a substantial influence from management and marketing perspectives on the invisible college of CSR research in communication. Moreover, the results of three longitudinal network models display the patterns of structural evolution of the scholarly collaboration and foundation literature networks, showing a maturing process of CSR knowledge construction in communication. Taken together, this study stimulates future CSR research in that it helps locate the knowledge base that may inspire new research fronts and the areas of vacancies that serve as promising venues for the discovery of CSR knowledge.}

Despite the Western-centric view of strategic communication, this study highlights the various communication strategies, such as rhetoric, symbolography, town-criers, Roko, Ewi, proverbs, idiophones, and music, that were utilized in precolonial times. The arrival of colonialists only modernized the process and introduced new mediums of communication. Modern factors such as WWII, nationalism, regional politics, civil war, Boko Haram Insurgency, and politics have also influenced the development of strategic communication. The paper recommends more research and courses on strategic communication in Nigeria to continue building a better understanding of its role in national security and conflict management.}

This paper provides a framework that describes the characteristics of external event triggers as well as the elements and strategic dimensions of value proposition dynamics. The relevance of this framework is illustrated by exemplars and case vignettes from the accommodation industry with regard to two external event triggers: human trafficking awareness and the COVID-19 pandemic.

In particular, it contributes to the literature by (1) examining the global LGBTQ CSR discourse constructed by Fortune Global 500 companies (136,820 words) with semantic network analysis and structural topic modeling; (2) surveying non-profit organizations’ guidelines and comparing corporate values with them; and (3) exploring how stakeholder expectations and institutional factors influence CSR communication. Results indicate 6 corporate topics and 9 non-profit topics, which were explicated by referencing organizations’ original writing. It is further shown that stakeholder expectations and institutional factors not only affect whether or not corporations report LGBTQ efforts, but also affect what topics they highlight in CSR reports. Corporations in democratic countries with substantial stakeholder expectations emphasize areas that need high investment and exceed legal obligations.}

This theme is considered within the context of the Korean culture of Shim-Cheong, a state focused on “we-ness,” and Cheong. The study results reveal three important aspects of empathy for public relations practitioners: 1) an empathic appraisal that allows evaluation of public emotions, 2) a sensitivity that enables detection of/predicts a change in public mood, and 3) sympathetic arousal that ensures sincere communication of empathy in a crisis. When the public perceives organizations and their issues as problematic, public affect changes from positive to negative. Empathy as capacity, intuition, and attitude allows public relations practitioners to determine when public affect has significantly changed South Koreans in the culture of Shim-Cheong. Since South Koreans tend to express positive moods more readily than negative emotions, practitioners can use an affect monitoring system to identify social trends and perform more in-depth analyses to assess contextual meanings and identify potential risks.}

However, in practice, place branding shares many commonalities with public relations. It involves relationships with a wide range of stakeholders, reputation management, and communication campaigns that involve no direct sale of a product. While some have noted the parallels between place branding and public relations, the intersection of these two fields has not been reviewed empirically. This study examines the relationship between public relations and place branding by exploring how scholars in each field have conceptualised and represented the other in their research publications. A systematic review of 378 journal articles, published from 1988 to 2018 in 18 selected journals from both fields, was conducted. This research shows that while there is a significant conceptual crossover between the two fields and they work together in practice, the place branding literature largely treats public relations as a promotional tactic rather than a disciplinary body of knowledge. Conversely, outside of public diplomacy research, public relations has shown little interest in places and place communication, and there is limited research applying public relations theories and concepts to places. This paper adds to current knowledge on the interdisciplinarity of public relations theories and concepts and how public relations is perceived outside its own field and suggests new possibilities for interdisciplinary research on place communication.}

We identify the patterns in the theoretical and methodological approaches and the types of crisis, social media platforms, and contextual factors examined in SMCC research. Our findings demonstrate the common trends and differences between regions or societies. Scholars from North America dominated this field and primarily used quantitative methods, such as content analysis and experiments. A Western-oriented situational crisis communication theory was the most frequently applied theoretical framework. Twitter and Facebook were the most frequently used social media tools, and natural crises were studied most frequently. Nearly half of the SMCC studies collected research data about crises within America, and none focused on African countries. Contextual factors, such as political, cultural, and media characteristics, were found to affect online crisis communication practices. Our study can thus inform future discussions by revealing current theoretical gaps.}

In Study 1, we demonstrated that consumers who were asked to actively participate in CSR campaigns were more likely to consider the company’s motives public-serving rather than self-serving, evaluated the company more favorably, and had higher purchase intentions regarding the company’s products, mediated by perceived consumer–company interactivity. In Study 2, we showed that psychological empowerment and consumer–company identification can explain the positive effects of perceived interactivity. Unlike non-participatory campaigns, participatory campaigns empower consumers and strengthen consumer–company identification through perceived consumer–company interactivity, which, in turn, positively affects perceived CSR motives, attitudes toward the company, and purchase intentions. Our studies highlight the value of consumer engagement with participatory CSR campaigns and explain why it works. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.}

Through a systematic review, this study first identified nuances in the manipulation of apology, diminishing, and scapegoating strategies. The study then tested the effect of the variation of the same strategy on the public’s responses using three experiments. The findings revealed that an explicit apology was more effective than an implicit apology, while an apology with corrective action was even more effective than an apology alone. Internal scapegoating significantly harmed an organization compared to external scapegoating. Following the results of the study, researchers are encouraged to review their crisis response strategy manipulations to ensure the internal validity of experimental studies in crisis communication.}

It shows that the companies under investigation differ significantly in terms of the degree of controversy and positioning frequency. The study provides evidence that corporate characteristics (e.g. size), timing and thematic factors, as well as the communicative behavior of other companies/organizations determine positioning strategies. We identified two different strategic motives for socio-political positioning: The aim to (1) further improving trust, image, and reputation while avoiding risk as far as possible or (2) to secure room for maneuver within the framework of specific, very concrete (socio-political) challenges and in doing so accepting certain risks in the process.}

This study introduces a novel synthesis of Signaling theory and Stewardship theory and examines the moderating impact of brand governance on the relationship between green brand identity, consistent communication and channel partner commitment, leading to tactical green marketing orientation. Distinguishing itself from previous research, our approach embraces a multi-perspective lens, delving into the viewpoints of both channel partners and organizations (i.e., managers). Employing an explanatory sequential mixed method design, the first phase involved an empirical survey with 248 respondents (Study 1). Subsequently, the second phase (Study 2) comprised qualitative interviews with 41 respondents. The findings from both studies converged, revealing a positive association between “consistent communication” and “attitude,” a robust connection between “attitude” and “commitment,” and a favorable correlation between “green brand identity” and “attitude,” ultimately leading to a positive relationship between “attitude” and “green tactical marketing orientation". This research significantly contributes to the comprehension of B2B green brand positioning by demonstrating, that in the B2B context, brand governance influences channel partners' commitment and tactical green marketing orientation.}

The study employed a mixed-method approach with a dominant qualitative component. In the first part, the Delphi method was conducted to understand the fundamental issue of acceptability of the Global Capability Framework. Secondly, the study included an online survey that provided descriptive results about variations in the Global Capability Framework’s applicability within the Malaysian context. For the final part, interviews were organised to explore the views of three PR communities on the Global Capability Framework at the individual, organisational, and professional levels in Malaysia. This study is the first attempt to provide a comprehensive Global Capability Framework for the Malaysian context. We found that cultural capability should emerge as a new dimension of this framework in Malaysia's PR context. Hence, this study will benefit all PR communities in standardising and delivering a country-specific capability approach based on the Global Capability Framework to deal with national and global challenges in an increasingly complex world.}

Firms have been actively searching for solutions to survive the crisis and improve business resilience in the post-crisis phase. In developing strategic responses to the risks of failing to get through the “black swan” event, tactics such as impression management may be selected by managers to mitigate contemporary challenges. This paper aims to uncover the actions taken by organisations to manage financial information and market perceptions. It compares the effects of the strategies in normal and unprecedented situations. The empirical analysis of delisting events suggests that the application of impression management is associated with lower delisting risks; however, the effects of such tactics are attenuated in the presence of macro-environmental shocks. Further analyses of market reaction reveal that investors seem to discount all information at the time of disclosure during the pandemic, making the market reaction to impression management less favourable. This provides further support for the reduced efficiency of impression management in alleviating delisting risks following the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results have important implications for firms' development of strategies in response to external turbulence.}

This paper fills this gap in the literature by analysing the possible interconnection between observational learning, product involvement and perceived risk on the effectiveness of influencers' recommendations. To this end, we propose a new exploratory model applying an approach grounded in observational learning and an extension of the theory of planned behaviour, analysed by means of PLS-SEM in a sample of 948 followers of influencers who recommend fashion products. The results have new implications for influencer marketing research by reporting the impact of risk on product attitude and purchase intention, although their predictive power was lower than expected. Furthermore, perceived authenticity of the message exerted the highest positive effect on attitude, and it was established as a significant mitigator of user-perceived risk. Finally, product involvement, a construct unexplored in previous studies, revealed a considerable influence on both perceived authenticity of the message and attitude.}

This study examines how different levels of LGBTQ+ diversity CSR (i.e., proactive, passive, refusal) affect public responses. The proposed model investigates how public perceptions of corporate support for LGBTQ+ diversity (PCSL), influenced by CSR level, affects two dimensions of corporate associations differently (corporate ability and CSR association), and consequently CSR responses (supportive communication intent, purchase intent, and corporate evaluation in this study). The role of perceived value-driven motivation as a mediator was also examined. An online experiment was conducted with two Fortune 500 companies (Dell and Kellogg's). Overall, the results suggest that proactive CSR leads to higher PCS-L and better CSR outcomes among the general public than a passive or refusal approach. PCS-L, directly and indirectly, affects individuals’ CSR associations, which are mediated by value-driven motives. In turn, CSR associations positively influence publics’ supportive communication intent, purchase intent and corporate evaluations. As for CA associations, we found that they had a rather complicated relationship with PCS-L. Specifically, PCS-L had a direct negative effect on CA associations (Dell) or no effect (Kellogg), indicating possible backlash effects. However, higher PSC-L resulted in more favorable perceived motives of the CSR program, driven by the company's moral grounds and corporate values, consequently resulting in greater CA associations (positive indirect impact). Thus, perceived value-driven motives can offset potential backlash effects related to CA associations and corresponding CSR outcomes.}

Our findings illustrate the status of GPR scholarship in terms of publication trends, authorship, research contexts, research topics, theoretical knowledge structure, methodological approaches, and ethical considerations. Findings suggest that GPR is a fast-growing field attracting international and multidisciplinary scholarly interests; yet has not been clearly defined and theorized. With strong theoretical roots in relationship management, GPR has the potential to develop context-relevant theories capturing the distinctive relational dynamics in various government communication situations.

From previous studies related to disruptive innovation, the paper analyzes, discusses, and clarifies that the emergence of cloud videoconferencing services is a “high-end disruptive innovation” - a phenomenon that revolutionized the market for traditional hardware videoconferencing systems and opened and drove not only the existing videoconferencing market but also new markets. The paper then presents new insights into the mechanisms of high-end disruptive innovation, which are different from the “low-end disruption” and “new market disruption” asserted by Christensen, from the perspective of innovation management and strategic management theory, including product architecture, business models, and dynamic capabilities.}

abstract = {As a subfield of public relations, global public relations has grown significantly over the past three decades. However, the state of knowledge about its structure and evolution remains unexplored. Who are the key players and what are the key works in the global public relations literature? Which primary research topics have been investigated over time? This study answers these questions by using bibliometric methods to examine published articles in scholarly global public relations research from 1983 to 2019. A total of 35,982 citations from 521 articles permit us to conclude that the field of global public relations has experienced exponential growth, especially during the last decade. Public Relations Review has been the primary outlet for publishing articles on global public relations. The topics of interest during this period can be generally categorized into three groups: culture or cultural dimensions of global public relations, application of public relations theories (e.g., Excellence Theory) and perspectives to other countries, and the introduction of public relations in other countries. The topic of public relations roles appeared in research only in 2000−2009, while public diplomacy emerged as a new theme in the literature in 2010−2019.}

An online survey was conducted with samples of social media users in China and the U.S. Results from the multiple-group analysis show that the degree of impact of the three antecedents varies significantly between consumers in China and the U.S. Specifically, the influence of attitudes toward CSR in social media on consumers’ engagement with CSR communication in social media is stronger for the Chinese participants than for the U.S. participants. In addition, peer communication and opinion leadership characteristics have significantly stronger effects on consumers’ engagement with CSR communication via social media for the Chinese participants than for the U.S. participants.}

Indeed, the profession’s rapid adoption of SMIs as part of their campaigns raises questions regarding the ethics of their use and the extent to which they fit with normative models of public relations practice that promote genuine dialogue and responsible advocacy. This study explores this tension between the uses and potential misuses of SMIs by examining the worldviews, strategies and practices of senior public relations practitioners at several agencies in Sydney, Australia. It proposes a new critical framework for understanding the influences that SMIs are in fact having on public relations practice, which builds on models of dialogic public relations and a critical eco-systems perspective. Ultimately, this study argues that the affordances provided by the emergence of SMIs are predisposing practitioners to persuasive strategies and covert activities that lack transparency and are inconsistent with ethical ideals of best practice for organizational public relations.}

Information in the disclosures and analysts' opinions influence investor-trading behavior, and consequently, affects the asset prices. As sentiments factored in disclosures are a source of market action, this study aims to capture the sentiments from disclosure information to assess asset prices' impact. The paper adopts a deep neural network-based prediction model for conducting sentiment analysis on heterogeneous datasets. We construct a sentiment simulation model of voluntary disclosures to know whether the managers can use the market sentiment as a strategic input to boost market performance by suitably drafting the tone and content of disclosures without compromising their quality and veracity. The Deep Neural Networks with LSTM algorithm is found to outperform the Deep Neural Networks with RNN and other baseline machine learning classifiers in terms of predictive accuracy of the NSE NIFTY50. The variable importance computed also validates that market news, combined with historical indicators, predicts the stock market trend closer to the actual trend.}

Our findings show that the influence of e-cigarette flavor on perceived relative risk and negative beliefs has an opposite pattern for generation X consumers versus millennials. Millennials perceive cherry-flavored e-cigarettes as less risky, and perceive tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes as less risky when they are associated with close social ties. Our mixed methods study contributes to the marketing and public health disciplines by uncovering health-related perceptions and beliefs as outcomes of e-cigarette flavor and social influence.

This conceptual essay defines brandstanding as an organization (corporation, nonprofit, or government agency) taking a public stance on a contentious issue (generally, outside of its industry or core purpose) while articulating its corresponding values and maintaining authenticity. It further describes the phenomenon in four components: (1) organizational and stakeholder values, (2) authenticity, (3) engagement, and (4) measurement. Understanding the role of each can help PR practitioners guide organizations toward informed participation in civic discourse. While some have encouraged an approach that minimizes contention (i.e. Argenti, 2020), this essay uses moral decoupling theory to argue that reducing the distance between what they say and how they act (Dowell & Jackson, 2020; Weiner, 2021) and striving for authenticity—the continuity, credibility, integrity, and symbolism of an organization’s stance (Morhart et al., 2015)—should be the most crucial factors in engagement decisions.}

Responding to the call to fully exploit SMIs for achieving public relations objectives, the research aimed to search for systematically identifying the most suitable SMIs with whom to collaborate for CSR endorsements. Grounded in social learning theory and the influence framework, this study examined the effects of characteristics and leadership of an SMI who endorses CSR initiatives on generating the supportive behavior towards the initiatives among the corporation’s most influential public on social media, its consumers. Results from a survey of 967 U.S. consumers showed that non-CSR-themed SMI endorsers trigger target consumers’ supportive behavior towards the CSR initiative which they have endorsed when the consumers perceive them as opinion and taste leaders. The SMI endorsers’ trustworthiness, expertise, uniqueness, and (consumer-SMI) congruity constituted their opinion leadership perceived by the consumers while expertise, uniqueness and congruity formed their taste leadership. Opinion and taste leadership fully mediated the effects of trustworthiness, expertise, and uniqueness on consumers’ CSR supportive behavior while partially mediating the impact of congruity on the CSR supportive behavior. The findings shed light on how to select effective SMIs in non-CSR domains to generate consumers’ behavior to support the CSR initiatives.}

Public relations theories, such as organization–public relationship and symmetrical communication, have been frequently applied in internal communication research. In terms of methodology and sample, quantitative and qualitative methods have been equally utilized, and employees from multiple organizations were frequently used as a type of sample in a large portion of research works. The most productive researchers and institutions of internal communication research in public relations were also identified. Implications for ongoing internal communication research in public relations disciplines are discussed.

Such impact, idiosyncratic to universities’ unique and complex sociopolitical role, justifies their corporate social responsibility (CSR) as organizational legitimacy, license to operate. Judged against strategic issues management’s (SIM) rationale for using stakeholder expectations to define legitimacy gaps (between organizational impact and stakeholder expectations), the engagement role unique to universities tests their functional and moral ability to enact themselves constructively in communities where they operate and in society at large. Stakeholder voices of all kinds engage to set CSR standards as means for improving the qualitative functioning of society; no society can be better than the organizations that engage to draw conclusions and create norms by which to enact it. Unique CSR engagement roles of universities include (1) elevating the functional and moral standards which guide them, (2) engaging in internal and external public arenas to foster constructive social impact, and (3) fostering research, teaching, and community service as engagement that produces social change by raising standards of moral and functional impact. This aspirational principle focuses attention as to whether universities’ CSR/legitimacy efforts reinforce hegemony or seek constructive social change.}

As intermediaries who shape symbols, discourses, meanings, and practices amidst evolving social, cultural, and psychological landscapes such as these, public relations professionals must remain mindful of their potential to inflict harm on the recipients of their work and understand publics’ lived experiences that may involve trauma. Yet, little research has explored public relations work from a trauma-informed approach. Building upon Macnamara’s (2016b, 2018) architecture of listening model, this study considers how public relations can help enact trauma-informed organizational listening. As such, this qualitative analysis of interviews with 54 public relations and strategic communication professionals yielded insights for listening with consideration for trauma and harm among diverse publics. Findings suggest that public relations professionals engage in trauma-informed listening via respect and sensitivity, listening out for invisible or unheard trauma, consideration of power distance, understanding that the trauma can be inflicted by communications work, and with consideration for ‘compassion fatigue.’ Combined with existing organizational listening theory, this article offers practical recommendations for how organizations can enact trauma-informed listening.}

While as a consumer, one may buy from firms that show sensitivity to climate change and sustainability practices; however, when it comes to investing, they may behave the opposite. Scholarly research has predominantly examined the sustainability crisis and its implications in B2C settings. However, the issue is under-researched and more pertinent to B2B firms' practices as climate change is largely affected by the adopted industrial practices in the value chain and manufacturing process, which may not be environmentally friendly. In B2B firms, it is a complex scenario given that several value chain partners and intermediaries are involved, and their practices need to be aligned and integrated with the firm's sustainable development agenda. This tension naturally raises a question, i.e., what strategies B2B firms should adopt to generate stakeholders' value in view of the critical climate change risks? In attempting to resolve this pertinent challenge, our study provides a framework linking climate change risks to the firm's brand strategy, customer engagement, and, finally, to stakeholders' value. In developing our framework, we consider key contingency factors related to the firm, customer, and country. We also provide managerial guidance for B2B firms in mitigating the direct and indirect effects of the climate crisis and suggest directions for extending research on climate change risks and sustainability practices.}

We propose to analyse sustainability objectives in the energy sector through a spectral analysis of the dynamics of the main indicators over a period of 11 years, judging that this period adequately captures the causal vulnerabilities induced by economic crises and other socio-economic events, which makes renewable energy relevant as a new support for regional economic development among the European Union. The novelty of the approach lies in the assessment of renewable energy at the regional level in the context of the global economic and pandemic crises, which have been determining factors in the current geo-political and economic developments. We also aim to create energy sustainability clusters in the presence and absence of seasonality. The methods and procedures used will be represented by a critical literature review in order to verify the working hypotheses and to design, test and validate a new statistical model of energy sustainability seasonality. The modelling results will enable the creation of an EU-wide sustainability profile useful to supranational decision-makers for adjusting energy policies to ensure the energy transition towards 2050.}

This research adopts an exploratory approach, mixes qualitative and quantitative methods, and is based on the case study of AXA, the number 1 global insurance brand. The authors interviewed learners, trainers, and managers from the company. The originality lies in the comparison of five different training methods: face-to-face, videoconference, non-tutored e-learning, tutored e-learning, and serious games. The qualitative study reveals that serious games create value according to five dimensions: conception, optimization, cognition, emotion, and socialization. The four recommendations are: (1) to integrate serious games into a wide-ranging training protocol; (2) to balance face-to-face and distance-learning phases; (3) to assess knowledge transfer and to check that learners can use what they learned in the real world; and (4) to ensure learner self-awareness and enhance cognitive engagement. The quantitative study suggests that value ​​created by serious games is significantly different from value ​​created by other learning methods. Additionally, managers recognize significantly higher value creation ​​than trainers and learners.}

Research underlines leadership as a key to transformation success; however, studies have not systematically examined the impact of leaders on organizational change, particularly concerning organizations’ DT. To fill this research gap, we conducted an experimental study with 815 participants to analyze the effectiveness of complementary leadership behaviors that are relevant in the digital age: task-oriented (more precisely, digital transformation–oriented) and people-oriented leadership behaviors, and in particular their interaction. Surprisingly and in contrast to prior studies, the results show that the combination of complementary leadership behaviors did not lead to the highest (lowest) level of employees’ desirable (undesirable) affective, cognitive, and behavioral change responses. This study reveals that organizations are well-advised not to disregard people orientation when going digital as this leadership behavior buffers the potential downsides of digital transformation–oriented leadership behavior, which is mandatory to stay competitive in the digital era.}

This creates uncertainties for value chain actors and the trust relationships between them. In this paper we aim to understand the connections between trust and digitalisation. We investigate how trust relations affect digitalisation, and how digitalisation affects trust relations among value chain actors, using the Dutch flower sector as a case study. Our findings show that the sector has a high level of interpersonal trust, but limited institutional trust, as the relationships between companies are highly competitive and transactional. In this context, limited trust hinders digitalisation in multiple and mutually reinforcing ways, inducing a vicious cycle whereby existing distrust or limited trust results in limited digitalisation, which in turn causes more distrust due to uncertainties around the digitalisation process, further increased by existing (technological) path dependencies. Hence there is a need for 1) awareness of mutually reinforcing (dis)trust dynamics and vicious (or virtuous) cycles in relation to digitalisation are needed; 2) higher levels of understanding of what digitalisation entails and 3) joint strategy building and foresighting in the value chain.}

This paper defines the ecosystem as external stakeholders interdependent on a focal firm, and shows how such stakeholders play different roles as disruption unfolds. Focusing on incumbent firms and their ecosystems, this paper describes and categorizes the role of ecosystem stakeholders across various stages of disruption. Two cases on the disruption caused by digitalization in the advertising sector are analyzed. A processual ecosystem stage model is developed including the following roles: reassuring, questioning, unbalancing, and settling. These roles point at the reliance on past stakeholders during disruption, and show how new stakeholders come into play. Most disruption research has focused on how new actors replace incumbent firms or the sector-level disorder. The ecosystem lens centered on an incumbent brings a fresh perspective on such firms' efforts to survive and shows how interdependencies in the ecosystem play out when disruption takes place. The processual stage model, which delineates the different roles of ecosystem stakeholders during a disruption, offers valuable new insights to the existing disruption literature.}

Often called universe 4.0, this is an economy based on data that dilutes, in an unprecedented fashion, the boundaries between the physical, biological and digital world in all spheres of society. In having to face up to the uncertainty, complexity and speed associated with this global challenge, organisations of all kinds will be impelled to rethink future skills, jobs and business models. We focus on how this uncertain situation affects public relations. We suggest that the resulting paradoxes and controversies become an opportunity to research and reflect on the past and present of our discipline and redirect attention to the processes, strategies, and tools of intervention required for improved contemporary and future effectiveness. This present study analyses universe 4.0 processes affecting both the practice and the social function of public relations and argues for close linkages with multidimensional strategic intelligences and disruptive technologies based on artificial intelligence. It also involves conducting exploratory qualitative research based on a bibliometric analysis of specialised literature; undertaking content analysis via computational linguistics techniques; and applying Delphi methodology to consider public relations in universe 4.0. Our findings suggest not only that strategic intelligence is under researched in our field, but that a more developed public relations intelligence capable of adapting to universe 4.0 needs to be a hybrid of existing public relations and contemporary strategic intelligence.}

This article examines how often public relations practitioners encounter moral issues in their day-to-day work, how they assess digital communication tools and practices in terms of ethics, and the resources on which they rely to tackle moral challenges. Four research questions were addressed in an online survey among 2,324 practitioners who work in PR departments of organisations or in PR agencies across Europe. Results show that PR practitioners face more moral challenges in their daily work than they have faced in the past. Regarding digital communication tools and practices, they report moral concerns especially related to using bots, exploiting personal data for big-data analyses, paying social media influencers, and using sponsored content. Personal values and beliefs are the most important resource for dealing with moral issues—whether because only a minority of practitioners has participated in any formal ethics training within the past three years, or because existing ethical guidelines are outdated. Results call for the development of ethical guidelines that can provide explicit advice in the area of digital communication. Furthermore, structured training programs and ethics courses in graduate programs are needed to enhance practitioners’ ethical knowledge.}

An online experiment among 221 general consumers in the United States was conducted. The results demonstrated that negative messages regarding CSR distributed by employees in face-to-face communication decreased publics’ favorable attitudes and behavioral intentions to a greater extent than that distributed via social media (i.e., Facebook). However, the effect of communication channel became insignificant when positive messages regarding CSR were shared by employees. The results further showed that perceived authenticity mediated the effects of channel and message valence on publics’ attitudes and behavioral intentions. Theoretical and practical implications for CSR practices and employee communication are discussed.}

Data were compiled from the websites of NPOs (n = 102) that were collaborating with FTSE 100 companies. The results of regression analysis show that the ability of NPOs to deliver economic rent (to business partners) and to establish calculative trust (pre-collaboration trust) is positively associated with their portfolio size. Furthermore, the results indicate that the ability to create social value is also positively associated with portfolio size but only for larger NPOs, and that the delivery of collaboration options is negatively associated with portfolio size. We discuss these findings in relation to their implications for research and practice.}

Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data (N = 270). The findings suggest that functional, economic, and emotional values significantly increase attitudes leading to adoption intentions. Further, contamination concerns moderate the relationships between values and attitudes as well as attitudes and intentions. The findings enrich the literature of collaborative consumption by integrating theories of consumption value and consumer contamination.

It also explored whether the effects of strategic framing changed when skeptical comments were made online by friends or strangers. A total of 400 customers participated in an online between-subjects experiment. The results showed that the credit-sharing message better protected perceived values-driven motives and positive attitudes toward the company after the customers were exposed to skeptical comments, regardless of who posted the skeptical comments. Customers who read the credit-sharing message also showed stronger intention to defend the company’s CSR efforts and stronger purchase intention when the skeptical comments came from a friend.

Our study followed a qualitative approach by applying an abductive research methodology to make sense of 85 semi-structured interviews with executives involved in the erstwhile buyer–supplier relationships that we investigated. We found that supplier switching-back processes (SSBPs) can be understood as constituted by a set of alignments and misalignments between boundary spanners (i.e. top management, purchasing and sales agents, engineers and technicians) in the organisations involved. Thus, peoples' interactions, or lack thereof, directly affect the possibility for buyers and suppliers to restore their severed relationships. We conclude that boundary spanners pursue seven distinct roles during different periods in SSBPs, roles that relate to three identified functions of boundary spanners in such processes. The paper closes by highlighting what our findings imply for business managers, limitations and some possible directions for future research.}
