abstract = {Unlike the progressive growth of developed countries that have transitioned from large-scale tourism to intelligent tourism, China's tourism sector exhibits characteristics of short-term leapfrog strategic change. However, existing research lacks a sufficient theoretical explanation of how China's tourism industry can achieve this leapfrog strategic change. Based on a longitudinal case study, this study finds that digital supplementation and intelligent innovation constitute two key stages in Chinese enterprises' leap-forward strategic change from large-scale park tourism to intelligent tourism from 2012 to 2020. Digitalization is an important path for Chinese enterprises to realize transformation and upgrading, mainly through digital acceleration and reconstruction learning mechanisms, to drive the double leap in strategic change and tourism industry model innovation. In the context of a mismatch between digital technology and managerial skills, this study provides a theoretical model for firms to implement a leap-forward strategic change in intelligent tourism. It not only supports strategic change theory and organizational learning but also provides management illumination for digital rural construction, national tourism intelligence policy development, and enterprise intelligent tourism reform practice.}

abstract = {Forest ecosystems are notably influenced by: 1) the rate and spatial distribution of forest land development, and 2) how remaining undeveloped forest lands are managed. Regarding this second factor, economics and ecology research conducted in different locations in the U.S. suggests that increasing housing development can reduce the profitability of commercial timber production and thus the intensity with which landowners manage their forest lands. Some studies, however, suggest that in some locations these effects are not evident. We sought to consider what contextual factors might influence where and when development effects on forest management might become evident. We began with a critical review and synthesis of existing research addressing the degree to which housing development influences private forest management. We followed that with an empirical (logit) analysis of the likelihood of “active” (e.g., thinning) and extractive (e.g., harvesting) management on nonindustrial private forest lands in Oregon and Washington (U.S.), as a function of stand, site, and other factors, including nearby housing development. From our review and synthesis of previous research literature, we conclude that the varying results of previous studies likely owe to a combination of biophysical and socioeconomic contextual factors that influence both how prevalent development impacts might be in different locations and how easily they can be observed in empirical analyses. The results of our analysis of active and extractive management in Oregon and Washington are largely consistent with this finding, with some regions showing statistically significant negative effects owing to housing development, and other regions remaining largely unaffected. We conclude that policymakers and managers need to consider the biophysical and socioeconomic context of different study areas when evaluating the implications of individual study results.}

To profit from digitalization, providers and customers tend to move away from transactional product-centric model to relational service-oriented engagement. This relational transformation is brought about through digital servitization. However, current knowledge about how providers and customers transform their relationship to achieve benefits from digital servitization is lacking. This paper addresses that knowledge gap by applying the relational view theory to a study of four provider-customer relationships engaged in digital servitization. The results provide evidence for four relational components – complementary digitalization capabilities, relation-specific digital assets, digitally enabled knowledge-sharing routines, and partnership governance – that enable providers and customers to profit from digital servitization. A key contribution is the development of a relational transformation framework for digital servitization that provides an overview of how the four relational components evolve as the relationship progresses. In doing so, we contribute to the emerging servitization literature by offering key relational insights into the interdependence of activities throughout the transformation phases of provider-customer relationships in digital servitization.}

We observe, in particular, the region's position within Mather's well-known Forest Transition and what this suggests for the future of Latin American forest development and for the important effect of aggregate economic development on forest use, for agriculture's role in deforestation and policies to control it, and for the need for more information about the forest industry and its impact on forest-dependent human communities and on the forest itself. More or better information about each of these themes would lend confidence to our findings. More importantly, it would enable improved market and policy adjustments for the large changes that we anticipate both economic development and global climate change will bring to Latin America's forests and forest sector in the years ahead. Finally, we finish by noting the rapidly growing demands for non-consumptive uses of Latin America's forests and the importance of information about those as well.}

Most of the benefits potentially achievable in soilless systems are possible through precise and continuous management and adjustment of plant nutrition. Under operational conditions, the electrical conductivity (EC) is the main driving parameter leading fertigation strategies, but its measure in the drainage water can be not completely representative of the root zone in the growing medium. Nowadays low-cost sensors can be adopted to measure bulk EC (ECb) in the substrate. The Hilhorst equation is commonly used to convert the ECb into pore-water EC (ECw). This equation is widely calibrated for soil cultivation, but unable to perform properly for soilless substrate with high moisture content and water permittivity. In this work, two cultivation cycles of cherry tomato, managed in a closed-loop soilless system, were used to calibrate and validate two alternative models to the above equation (i.e., generalized additive model - GAM, and extreme gradient boost model - XGBoost). The models predicted ECw from the ECb recorded by substrate sensors. Plants were grown in rockwool using two different strategies for nutrient solution refill achieving different ECw trends during the cultivation. The Hilhorst equation confirmed its unsuitability for ECw prediction in soilless systems. ECw prediction through GAM was not satisfying at low and high ECw values. XGBoost was the most suitable model for ECw estimation, particularly at extreme EC values.}

For this purpose, five treatments were tested: (i) a control (CTL) irrigated at 100% of the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) during the entire season; ii) sustained deficit irrigation (SDI), irrigated at ∼70% of CTL; (iii) regulated deficit irrigation (RDI), irrigated as SDI, except during the initial period of the second fruit growth stage, when trees were irrigated at 35% of the CTL, maintaining a moderate water stress level of around –1.5 MPa of stem water potential (Ψs), until fruits reached 70% of their final size. In addition, two geotextile mulch treatments were established, using the same irrigation criteria as the SDI and RDI treatments. The available irrigation water supplied about 66% of the crop evapotranspiration, but if it is managed under a SDI regime with the incorporation of mulching it is possible to increase the crop sustainability and reduce the pressure over the water resources. Since SDI did not reduce the yield with respect to the CTL treatment, it increased WPc by 35% and the incorporation of mulch significantly increased the water status of the soil and the crop, thus reducing the intensity of water stress by 18% on average, which was expressed in a higher leaf gas exchange rate and was also a factor that significantly increased crop production variables and WPc.}

In Canada, current forest policies and commercial management systems do not adequately protect and conserve these natural resources. Decisions makers have yet to fully and effectively use local and traditional knowledge in forest policy and planning. This research used a participatory approach and 26 community interviews to document local criteria, elements and critical local values surrounding NTFP development and conservation within the traditional territory of the Missanabie Cree First Nation. Applied ethnobotany and policy analysis were used to develop a locally specified framework and case study to guide decision making. The analysis establishes key community-based objectives to promote diverse socio-economic benefits, while advancing local forest management systems. In particular, the co-research process identified six criteria (1. productive capacity; 2. health; 3. conservation and protection; 4. long-term management benefits; 5. community participation; 6. capacity of institutions) and associated 18 elements and 239 critical local values, which span the maintenance and enhancement of NTFPs. The resulting framework represents one possible re-entry point into the forest planning process for Missanabie Cree who are working to reconnect with their land following a long period of forced exclusion. Moving forward, leadership can continue to revise this framework to accommodate changing needs, further engage their membership, and in doing so refine their roles in forest governance. The research process and framework documented here can inform other forest land managers looking to create more inclusive decision making processes and document local values.}

One way to solve this challenge is to allocate resources to identifying and exploring new trends and opportunities emerging from the environment that may affect existing business models, and guide the development of new ones. As has been widely acknowledged, many incumbents fail at more radical business model innovation. Few studies have examined the role of cognition in this context. We suggest that differences in strategic issue identification and interpretation can help to explain the cognitive barriers that emerge when incumbent firms try to engage with radical business model innovation. We propose and test a Delphi-based method to elicit and examine differences in the perception of industry trends, comparing innovators, core business employees, and external experts, in the context of a leading Nordic insurance firm. We find considerable disagreement between members of the innovation department and the core business, in this firm. We suggest this helps explain why internal innovators find it challenging to “sell” radically new business models to the core business. More generally, we contribute to the growing literature on business model innovation in incumbent firms.}

The proposed model modifies the set of constructs by adding trust, security, and perceived risk. The sample consist of 334 Bizum platform users who are mainly young people between 18 and 22 years old. Obtained data was analyzed by a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). The results show that the strongest predictor for adopting to use Bizum mobile payment platform is habit, with 75 % of acceptance of young online banking users. But habit and social influence factors show 82.5 % of intention of use among young users. In contrary, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, price-value, hedonic motivation, trust, security, and perceived risk do not influence the intention to use this platform.

Lydia, and Tracey) performance and economic viability in high-tech glasshouses. We found that morphological traits such as plant height and leaf number were consistent across EC levels, while fruit weight, length, and width are significantly higher at the lowest EC (1.8). Photosynthetic rates increased significantly with rising EC levels, while other gas exchange parameters such as stomatal conductance, intrinsic water use efficiency, and vapour pressure deficit were similar for all EC levels tested. Yield analysis revealed a negative correlation between eggplant yield and increasing EC levels, with optimal yields in both eggplant varieties (0.81 and 1.14 kg m−2 week−1 in Lydia and Tracey, respectively) achieved at the lowest EC. Economic analysis highlighted that lower EC levels lead to lower operational costs and higher net profit values (NPV). Sensitivity analysis underscored the importance of wholesale price and crop yield in determining NPV, with lower EC levels offering a shorter payback period of approximately 6 years in Australia and China and higher economic returns. The study highlights the significance of optimizing EC levels for achieving more resource-sustainable and profitable eggplant production in greenhouses.}

The experiment was conducted in commercial orchards during the 2020 growing season, in the Hex River and Wolseley production areas, Western Cape, South Africa. The timing (date) and duration (days) of selected flower bud stages were recorded on individual plants, from April to November 2020 for bud swell, bud break, tight cluster, closed flower, open flower, petal fall, green fruit, colouring fruit, and fruit harvest respectively. Standard commercial management practices were followed on both sites. Cultivar 8-42 flowered from April to mid-October, with a peak during early August. Cropping occurred from early August to mid-November, and volumes peaked in October, at both sites. Cultivar 9-02 flowered from April to late October, with a peak during early August at the Wolseley site, whereas flowering for this cultivar only peaked during late September, at the Hex River site, indicating a possible climate related response. Subsequently, harvest started two weeks later at the Hex River site for ‘9-02’, while the highest yield volumes were obtained during October to early November, at both sites. This paper provides a first report on the phenological categorization of the reproductive development of commercial SHB blueberry cultivars, as produced in the Western Cape, South Africa. As all major management decisions in blueberry cultivation depend on the phenological phases of the crop, this information will contribute towards decision making regarding production, but also via quantifying the progression of each stage in addition to the peaks, allowing for additional logistical management. The influence of growing conditions on the phenological development of these cultivars was also explored and indicated the need for supplemental research considering the influence of micro-environmental conditions in driving evergreen production blueberry systems.}

abstract = {The continuing destruction of the Amazonian forest, the largest remaining tropical forest ecosystem, has massive social and environmental consequences for local populations, but also for the climate, global food security and biodiversity. With some 20% of the forest already lost and the Amazon region likely approaching a tipping point, the conservation of its forests is a burning issue. High expectations are vested in the sustainable use of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) as a means to reconcile conservation and development. Accordingly, hundreds of initiatives have been launched over the decades that rely on NTFPs. With the proliferation of the bioeconomy discourse in recent years, they have received a new impetus. But are these expectations justified and backed-up by facts? Based on a systematic literature review, this article assesses the state of knowledge on NTFPs as a basis for sustainable local development in the Brazilian Amazon. The analysis reveals that while the number of studies has been growing continuously, the knowledge base is rather patchy. Coverage is limited mostly to a few NTFPs with high commercial value. The literature mostly attests positive effects of NTFP use on forest conservation and contributions to meeting socio-cultural needs of local communities. By contrast, existing studies identify limitations in terms of local income generation and suggest to combine the use of NTFPs with the commercial management for timber and the sale of environmental services. In terms of biodiversity conservation, some studies also point to risks of initiatives that emphasize income generation and stress the importance of diversifying production. It is worrying, that empirical knowledge on the effects of such combined and diversified approaches is scarce. A research agenda is crucial to support the successful promotion of NTFP-based value chains in the Brazilian Amazon. This agenda should include a comprehensive analytical framework that enables robust evaluations of past and future interventions. A better understanding of the actual impacts of such initiatives is vital as evidence for proof of concept and for deploying them at scale.}

abstract = {Within the context of the circular economy, this article analyses how supermarkets can reduce food waste by implementing appropriate marketing strategies underpinned by digital technologies, such as Big Data predictive analytics. Little is currently known of the potential role of the emerging digital technologies in furthering the sustainability of supermarket chains in emerging economies. Thus, an original multiple case study has been conducted, involving six supermarket chains operating in Brazil and six farming distributors that produce fruit and vegetables (F&V). The findings show that actions towards food waste reduction based on the principles of the circular economy begin with an understanding of F&V stages of deterioration. Through such an understanding, a number of actions can be undertaken to reduce the negative effects of this deterioration. These include (among others) the management of prices, sales, operations, and purchases, all of which can be underpinned by such technologies as sensors and augmented reality in order to manage dynamic pricing, storage, and item display. The findings contribute to demonstrating how digital technologies can help supermarkets’ marketing departments in driving corporate sustainability while also benefiting both consumers and societal well-being.}

abstract = {Farmer’s management decisions and environmental factors are the main drivers for field spatial and temporal yield variability. In this study, a 22 ha field cultivated with corn for more than ten years using different prescription maps of nitrogen application rates was investigated. Prescription maps were developed based on archived yield maps, soil analysis and recently integrated with Sentinel 2 satellite images. In addition, farmer experience and availability of variable rate application (VRA) requirements had an influence on the development of the homogeneous management zones. The initial approach with VRA was quite simple, based on a simple partitioning of the field into three rectangular zones (defined mainly based on previous yield maps and farmer experience). The partitioning changed with time and knowledge, evolving to the final five irregularly shaped zones (defined based on Farm works decision support software). Furthermore, since 2010 the farmer began using soil moisture sensor for irrigation decisions. Results of the present study highlight an improvement in corn yield and a reduction in total applied nitrogen. Corn yield improved on average by 31% on a ten years basis to reach more than 14 ton/ha dm. in 2018. At the beginning of VRA, yield maps showed a high spatial variation between field zones compared to reduced variation in the following seasons. In addition, the nitrogen applied reduced by around 23% while the total yield was improving. These results showed an increase in the partial factor productivity from less than 54 to around 87 kg of corn grain per kg of nitrogen applied. This promising result shows that farmer management decisions can improve every season by continuous monitoring of crop performance, understanding field variability and taking advantage of recently developed decision support software tools.}

abstract = {Huanglongbing (HLB, a.k.a. citrus greening disease) has reduced Florida citrus production and acreage substantially since its discovery in 2005. Most commercially important citrus scion cultivars such as sweet oranges are susceptible to the disease and no cure is available at present. This has increased the demand for HLB-tolerant rootstocks to retain tree health and maximize productivity through higher-density plantings. Polyploidy in citrus has been associated with reduced tree size and enhanced biotic and abiotic stress tolerance. This study compared the potential of tetraploid rootstocks with diploid rootstocks for inducing dwarfing of the grafted ‘Valencia’ orange scion and for enhancing productivity and tolerance to HLB. Two trials, one at a poorly drained site in south-east Florida and another at a well-drained sandy site in central Florida, were established in 2015. Tree size, yield, yield efficiency, fruit quality, leaf nutrients, and canopy health were assessed over three production seasons from 2018/19 to 2020/21. The different rootstocks varied significantly in their effects on tree size, yield, and yield efficiency. Tree size induced by the diploid rootstocks, which included the Florida industry standards Swingle, sour orange, X-639, and US-897, was 55% larger on average compared to the tetraploid rootstocks. Cumulative yields were 32% higher on diploid rootstocks compared to tetraploid ones. However, tetraploid rootstocks induced a 27% higher yield efficiency on average. A significant rootstock effect on canopy health and nutrient status was found, but this effect was not consistent across locations and production years. Tetraploid rootstocks did not display higher HLB tolerance than diploid rootstocks, including the industry standards. However, effective tree size control, high yield efficiency, and higher fruit quality induced by many of the tetraploid rootstocks revealed their potential to be used in high-density plantings.}

The main conclusions were that the students with the intention of achieving a higher level of entrepreneurial skills were enroled in the Executive Master of Business Administration (EMBA) programme without omitting other master's degree programmes also chosen by students with entrepreneurial concerns. It was also found that the variable with the highest impact on entrepreneurial motivation was family environment. Our data lead us to maintain that these students were not always going to start up a new business. The originality of this paper comes from our survey with 1,135 responses from the master's degree programmes taught in five cities in Spain with the inclusion of an analysis for LATAM students.}

This integration refers both to the sustainability of the project's deliverable and to the sustainable management of projects. In this last perspective, sustainable project management, the project manager has a central and influential position. However, many factors or circumstances influence the behavior of the project manager with regards to addressing sustainability in his or her project? The study reported in this paper explored the variety factors that stimulate the project manager to address sustainability issues in the project he or she is managing. Based on the factors provided by the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPA), the study used Q-methodology to explore different subjective patterns of stimulus project managers experience. Based on the factor analysis of 49 Q-sorts, we discovered three factors in the stimulation of sustainable project management behavior. These three factors, that represent distinct stimulus patterns, were labeled as “Pragmatic”, “Intrinsically motivated” and “Task driven”. By identifying three distinct patterns of what stimulates project managers to address sustainability issues, the study contributes to a successful implementation of sustainable project management as a new ‘school of thought’ in project management.}

Beurré D'Anjou were collected at the official commercial harvest time and classified into three groups based on levels of sublethal sunburn: no sunburn (S0), mild sunburn (S1), and moderate sunburn (S2). Skin anatomy was characterized by SEM imaging, cell wall components were quantified by spectrophotometric techniques, and the expression of different genes related to cell wall remodeling was measured in S0, S1, and S2 tissues. Sun-damaged skin cells had reduced size and thickened walls. In the cuticular surface, a reduction of microcracking area, correlated with the intensity of the damage, was further noted. Cell wall fractionation revealed changes in the distribution of neutral sugars (NS) following sunburn, although no differences in uronic acid (UA) content were observed in the different pectin fractions. Hemicellulose and lignin contents were significantly (P<0.05) increased in sun-damaged tissues. Expression levels of genes encoding polygalacturonase (PcPG2), β-galactosidase (PcGAL2 and PcGAL4), xyloglucan endotransglycosylase (PcXET), and expansin (PCExp1) were increased in the skin of sun-damaged (S1 and S2) fruit. These results indicate that sunburn alters the anatomy and cell wall structure and composition of pear fruit skin, and stimulates different mechanisms involved in the acquisition of stress tolerance.}

To what extent is it possible to optimize over time the resources allocated to positioning a brand on search engines? Often keyword costs are understood as monetary costs and the literature on keyword auctions suggests convergence towards a long-run equilibrium expenditure path. However, search engine optimization techniques, associated with implicit costs, have mainly focused on the short run. This paper suggests drawing long-term inferences from estimated cost per click, as the economic cost of organic keywords. Web analytics software is used to gather these data for leading fashion e-commerce. A time series test of transition dynamics identifies convergence of economic keyword costs between branded and generic keywords or catch-up, as an early state of convergence, for almost all considered e-commerce.}

However, their complex multi-stakeholder governance structure complicates decision-making for Energy Efficiency Retrofits (EER). Although literature identifies some barriers linked to EER, they are often scattered and not identified within a process perspective that considers their contextual complexities. This study addressed this gap by examining stakeholders’ behaviours, barriers, and relations during EER decision-making processes, to detect stakeholders’ needs to catalyse the energy transition. Qualitative research was conducted on three representative Dutch shopping centres case studies. The cross-case analysis uncovered the decision-making process for EER and new barriers attributed to this building typology. Amongst other, detected barriers can be attributed to limitations with governmental and internal regulations, lifecycle conflicts, proposed interventions being out of scope, and existing technical challenges. The study also revealed causal relationships among stakeholders, showcasing varying interpretations of barriers and highlighting the roles of owners, property managers, and public authorities in overcoming them. Furthermore, the findings indicate the key role that different contextual variables play in the EER decision-making process, such as ownership type, governance structure, and leasing structure. This study offers insights and recommendations for shopping centre owners, property managers, and policymakers, to support them in navigating the energy transition of the retail building stock. Key recommendations include decentralizing decision-making, optimizing governance structure, streamlining sustainability advisors, and acknowledging the collaborative roles of property managers and policymakers in providing effective and holistic solutions.}

Subsequently, researchers evaluated its use. The experiment has been conducted through the introduction of two simulators, Gestionet, in the undergraduate classroom, and Global Management Challenge (GMC), in the master's degree classroom. Triangulation is included, gathering various data from students and firms. A 52-item survey was developed and tested statistically. Neural networks and fuzzy set-approaches were used to analyze students’ responses and understand how the activity stimulates students’ motivation (both intrinsic and extrinsic). Simulators offer multi-layered learning experiences to students and produce soft skills, such as strategic capacity, decision-making, and data analysis, and knowledge from their interactions with others and from their reflections on their actions and outcomes. These results are aligned with the competencies demanded by companies according to an analysis of the Report of the Association for the Progress of Management. This makes the simulator a great opportunity and a very useful tool for all the agents of the educational ecosystem.}
