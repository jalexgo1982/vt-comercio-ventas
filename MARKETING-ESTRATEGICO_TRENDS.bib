abstract = {Advances in the availability and sophistication of software to facilitate the analysis of secondary data have contributed toward the growth of textual analysis. 10-K reports are a particularly salient source of insight into an array of issues in accounting and finance research yet remain underutilized in marketing. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to offer a rationale for such analysis and a method that can be applied in B2B marketing. We draw on a strong tradition of textual analysis in finance to outline a method of text mining 10-K reports. We then discuss the downloading of raw texts, parsing raw text files and linking 10-Ks to various dependent measures. We provide links for downloading parsed 10-K files and suggest software for textual analysis. The framework offers B2B marketers a rich alternative to primary data and proprietary datasets. Ongoing advances in AI-enabled NLP text analysis further increase the future value of the approach for B2B marketers.}

Central to the SDG agenda is the vital role of business innovation in fostering positive change and promoting the triple bottom line of sustainability: people, planet, and prosperity. Many years have passed following the SDGs’ inception, yet the engagement of business innovation scholarship with the SDGs remains sparse. Moreover, a comprehensive review examining the convergence of business, innovation, and sustainability through the lens of the SDGs is notably absent, constraining insights into present advancements and prospective trajectories. In this regard, this study adopts the SDGs as a lens to investigate the contribution of business innovation to sustainable development challenges and its impact on the SDG agenda. To do so, this study conducts a systematic literature review, incorporating a bibliometric analysis of articles published in top-tier business journals, to offer an integrated overview of current trends in business, innovation, and sustainability research through the lens of the SDGs. In addition, this study performs a content analysis to consolidate and synthesize relevant research in this space, resulting in a multi-dimensional framework that illustrates the intricate, dynamic interplay between the drivers, dimensions, and impacts of business innovation on sustainability and their relationship with the SDGs. In doing so, this study accentuates extant gaps, delineates profound implications, and proposes meaningful directions to advance the understanding of the intersection between business, innovation, and sustainability in the context of the SDGs.}

Both businesses and business researchers are increasingly interested in the application of gamification. In this regard, this review aims to offer a state-of-the-art overview of gamification in business, revealing its current trends and future directions. Using business research on gamification published in the last decade (2012–2022) found on Scopus and Web of Science, we conduct a performance analysis to illuminate the field's performance (publication productivity and impact) alongside its key contributors (journals, authors, and countries) as well as a science mapping using a co-citation analysis to locate knowledge foundations, and bibliographic coupling and keyword co-occurrence analysis to reveal major themes in business gamification. Our exploration has unearthed gamification's pervasive influence across business domains, from enhancing learning and fostering innovation to empowering marketing strategies and catalyzing transformation. Gamification has also made significant inroads into management practices, driving engagement, influencing behavioral outcomes, and ushering sustainability. Peering into the future, our density-centrality quadrant analysis casts light on emerging frontiers. Noteworthily, we expect the next wave of gamification to be shaped by the allure of video games and the metaverse, bespoke industry-specific designs, confluence with e-commerce trends, emphasis on sustainable development, expanded social responsibilities, innovations in virtual reality, intersections with human urbanism, and the rise of smart cities. As gamification continues to integrate and reshape myriad facets of the business world, it holds the promise of not only enriching current practices but also charting the course for the future of innovative, sustainable, and transformative business strategies.}

Findings suggest that FOMO is a powerful belongingness facilitator that can support the crowd investor’s self-determination strategies and thus their willingness to take part in a crowdfunding community, sharing in its values and beliefs. FOMO can be used by entrepreneurs to activate identification mechanisms through which they can create a loyal fan base. We conclude by proposing an entrepreneurial action plan to guide the entrepreneur in making the most of FOMO in equity crowdfunding ventures.}

Two experiments demonstrate that threats to time autonomy mediate the impact of perceived busyness on variety seeking (study 3 and study 4). Additionally, this research verifies the boundary of busyness type (proactive busyness vs. forced busyness) (study 5). This study offers important theoretical and managerial insights by revealing the psychological mechanisms and boundary conditions and enhances our understanding of the busyness, threats to time autonomy, and variety seeking, offering valuable insights for strategic marketing and targeted advertising.}

Based on the organizational learning and sales literature, this study explores the relationship among salesforce steering, salesperson learning and innovative sales performance in service enterprises. It develops and tests a conceptual framework based on a survey of 476 strategic front-line employees (SFLEs) in China's tourism industry. The findings indicate that salesforce steering instruments have no direct effect on innovative sales performance, while exploratory learning and exploitative learning play mediating roles in the relationship between salesforce steering and innovative sales performance. These findings integrate different streams of literature and improve the understanding of the management and learning behaviour of SFLEs in the context of process innovation.}

The concept of organizational resilience has developed as a critical factor for firms to not only survive but thrive when faced with adversities. This research examines the multilevel elements of organizational resilience through a dynamic process model to enable MNEs to navigate change, adapt to adversity, and sustain success at five levels: (1) individual, (2) organizational, (3) ecosystem, (4) institutional, and (5) global. By embracing a dynamic approach to organizational resilience, MNEs canthrive against uncertainty and seize profitable opportunities in a challenging business environment.}

The characteristic was exhibited on the basis of various types of Generation Z consumers, based on the frequency of undertaken ecological behaviors which are distinguished in the Index of Ecological Behavior. It has been observed that self-esteem and self-perception as an ecological entity is translated into the level of engagement. Moreover, the level of engagement in ecological behaviors increases when the respondents function in an ecological environment (household, friends etc.). The research proves that members of Generation Z frequently and willingly undertake ecological behaviors which are, however, relatively infrequently supported by new technologies.}

Intense competition among vloggers and channel owners for advertising revenue and sponsorship has led to the increasing use of clickbait-style thumbnails and titles with exaggerated sentiments to boost click-through rates. Drawing on cognitive schema theory, we analyzed the sentiments in video titles, thumbnails, and captions to examine their effects on video views. Our analysis of 16,215 YouTube video covers reveals that strong sentiments in thumbnails, whether positive or negative, lead to more views, whereas strong sentiments in captions have the opposite effect. Video titles with positive rather than negative sentiments generate more views. Sentiment markers such as punctuation, all capitals, and emoticons all contribute to more clicks. These findings highlight that the use of sentiment in video covers can have both a positive and a negative effect, which has significant implications for video marketing.}

Further, it also explores how the need for personal interaction induces webrooming intention among consumers. To understand the complex and varied nature of consumers' webrooming intentions, we propose using the Uses and Gratification Theory and Uncertainty Reduction Theory to gain insights into consumers' webrooming intentions by focusing on both dimensions, i.e., gratifications and the risks involved in webrooming. Based on an online survey a total of 334 responses were collected. The data was analyzed sequentially: SEM (structural equation modeling) and fsQCA (fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis). The finding supported the role of hedonic and utilitarian motives in online search, further influencing offline purchase intention (webrooming intention). fSQCA reported that the presence of online search, hedonic motives, and perceived risk insufficiency conditions help achieve the highest level of intention to purchase from offline stores. The need for personal interaction positively moderated the association between online search and intention to purchase from offline stores. This research contributes to key theoretical and managerial implications related to the decision-making of retail settings (online/offline).}

In the evolving digital data rich market environment, customer-based resources, a subset of a firm's market-based resources, are becoming increasingly important as potential sources of competitive advantage. Customer information assets refer to information of economic value about customers owned by a firm. Information analysis capabilities are complex bundles of skills and knowledge embedded in a firm's organizational processes employed to generate customer knowledge from customer information assets. Customer insights or knowledge is a firm's extent of understanding of customers that informs its business decisions.

abstract = {Big data can improve the profitability and competitiveness of organisations by extending market knowledge and strategic marketing insight. However, there is a disconnect between the opportunities presented and the readiness of incumbent firms to engage with big data, with consequences for their ability to benefit from it. With many organisations overwhelmed by how to manage and use big data, the paper identifies the dynamic capabilities required to exploit big data for strategic marketing and to improve market responsiveness. Data gathered from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with senior managers from four case study organisations, reveals the five interconnected dynamic capabilities required to leverage value from big data. These capabilities are shown to be part of a sequential ‘sensing-reconfiguring-seizing’ process, in which the reconfiguring capabilities play a vital role. The findings contribute to dynamic capabilities theory by identifying and mapping the configuration of big data capabilities required to support strategic marketing initiatives. A new Big Data Capabilities Model is developed, which can be used by organisations to guide how they can leverage value from big data.}

The study gathered 332 responses to assess the hypotheses derived from both the Big Five personality traits and the Dark Triad personality framework. The study also investigates the mediating effect of attitude towards the metaverse and the moderating role of fear of missing out (FOMO). The findings suggest that extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism, narcissism, machiavellianism and psychopathy have a significant impact on the intention to use metaverse. Further, attitudes towards the metaverse and FOMO are found be to significant mediator and moderator, respectively. Finally, artificial neural network (ANN) results reveal narcissism to be the most important predictor of intention to use metaverse. This research makes a valuable contribution to the field of personality traits and offers insights to marketers regarding the personality traits that are more inclined to embrace the metaverse.}

To document this evolution of multichannel research, we conduct an in-depth review of 181 marketing papers in the domain, published between 1995 and 2021. We observe a shift in research topics, which we organize into three distinct eras: 1995–2004, 2005–2014, and a still evolving 2015–2021. We then use a multi-dimensional framework to identify how these topics have evolved over the eras. We extract a set of twelve key takeaways across customer and firm-focused research themes and identify the dominant research trends from this thematic exploration. We conclude by identifying areas that are conspicuous in their potential to advance our understanding and aid practice.}

However, a gradually emerging view is that the adoption of technology is also characterized by entrepreneurial or effectual reasoning, primarily due to technological and market uncertainties that call for more agile and experimental approaches at the digital age. Drawing on effectuation theory, we develop a research framework to examine the managerial reasoning during the adoption of marketing automation technology. Based on the results of a comparative multiple-case study on four large-sized industrial firms, we develop a maturity model of marketing automation adoption and show that even large-sized B2B companies apply effectual reasoning, which problematizes the rationality assumption in the technology adoption literature. Second, we show that during the adoption process, organizations' dominant reasoning mode follows an iterative pattern in which the adopting organization moves back and forth between effectuation and causation. Finally, we identify five key domains of marketing automation (customer knowledge, information systems infrastructure, analytics, interdepartmental dynamics and change management) and describe their gradual evolution at different stages of the adoption process.}

The artificial intelligence (AI)-powered digital technologies applications continue to emerge to enhance and improve novel ways of communication on social media platforms, particularly Instagram. Indeed, this has caused a change in the behavioral and social customer journey, where customers need to embrace a digital experience adoption. The AI applications primarily aim to study the shoppers browsing trend to draw new clients and expand businesses. Even the fashion industry has tapped into Instagram's business benefits in this fast-paced and competitive industry. With this quick and compelling way to capture shoppers’ attention towards fashion products, the purchase decision may differ between e-shoppers and conventional shoppers. AI seems to be extremely promising and has the potential to be a game changer for Instagram users, advertisers, and influencers. This study applies the Engel-Kollat-Blackwell (EKB) theory to investigate the effects of AI-based digital technology experiences on Instagrammers’ fashion apparel purchase decisions - perceived eWOM, perceived emotional value, perceived quality, perceived risk and perceived price. Based on data collected from Instagram users, the framework of this study was evaluated using structural equation modelling (SEM). Semi-structured in-depth interviews were also conducted as part of the research to get a more in-depth understanding of the profiles and behaviors of Instagram users. Our findings from both methodologies confirm that perceived emotional value, perceived quality, and perceived eWOM revealed a statistically significant and positive influence on Instagrammers’ purchase decisions for fashion apparel. Meanwhile, the importance performance matrix analysis (IPMA) identified perceived emotional value as the most important factor for Instagrammers, but the highest performance was perceived quality. This research has important implications for Malaysian online retailers and shoppers to adapt to the fast-changing digital transformation. Assuredly, this study makes a noteworthy contribution to attitudinal research on social media commerce within the fashion industry.}

Our primary data source consists of in-depth interviews conducted with managers and practitioners who possess extensive experience in innovation management and growth hacking. Through a systematic inductive concept development approach and a multilevel analysis, we develop a novel conceptualization that illustrates how growth hacking strategies can be effectively implemented across four levels of analysis: market, organization, project, and product. Our findings highlight the importance of adopting growth hacking practices to minimize the likelihood of innovation failure in each of these domains. From a practical perspective, we offer recommendations on the strategies that companies should employ to effectively learn from the challenges associated with innovation.

To do so, this article employs the marketing mix as an organizing framework and performs an integrative review of practice and scholarly articles relating to B2B marketing and COVID-19. In doing so, this article delivers a seminal integrative review that is informed by both practice and scholarly sources in B2B marketing, thereby establishing its methodological novelty and value. More importantly, this article highlights “what” is necessary and “how” B2B marketers can (re)configure the product, price, place, promotion, people, process, and physical evidence elements of their marketing activities to steer their B2B marketing operations toward success in a world where global crises are a commonplace. Therefore, this article contributes in two major ways: the first from a theoretical perspective, by extending the theoretical generalizability of transformative marketing, and the second from a managerial standpoint, by shedding light on practitioner issues and offering practical suggestions for B2B marketers to prepare for, navigate in, and recover from great crises in the new normal.}

Influencer marketing, which involves the use of endorsements from individuals with large social media followings, has emerged as an effective advertising tactic for reaching Christians on social media. However, there is a lack of research exploring the complexities of religion in advertising messaging, especially in the context of influencer marketing. To fill this gap, we apply the social identity, persuasion knowledge, and symbolic interactionism theories to propose relationships between message cues in Christian influencers' social media posts and follower engagement. We analyzed 20,068 Facebook posts, 20,517 tweets, and 13,857 Instagram posts to determine the impact of three categories of message cues on engagement. Across multiple studies, key findings indicate religious and promotional cues increase and decrease engagement across platforms, respectively.

We reveal that the effectiveness of social media content in generating customer brand engagement depends on its ability to be entertaining. Specifically, our findings demonstrate that entertainment affects customer engagement and mediates the relationship between content marketing (specifically, content aesthetic quality and celebrity endorsement) and customer engagement with luxury fashion brands.

The adoption of disruptive technologies associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, is reshaping the way people work, learn, lead, manage, recruit, and interact with each other. The aim of this study is to contribute to the theoretical development of human resource management (HRM) in the context of Industry 4.0, promoting directions for the sector and HRM professionals, organizations, and the workforce that are required to face the challenges of Industry 4.0. To achieve this objective, this study performs a systematic literature review and content analysis of 93 papers from 75 journals. The main results of the research show that digital trends resulting from Industry 4.0 affect the field of HRM in 13 different themes, promoting trends and challenges for HRM, the workforce, and organizations. This paper seeks to promote insights for studies on the interference of digitalization in HR for the evolution of the digital age, as well as for companies that want to become more productive, human, and digital.}

Based on Dr. Hunt's retrospective writings and personal perspectives shared by his collaborators, we identify critical basic resources and higher-order competences underlying the success of Dr. Hunt's ideation, development, and promotion of impactful B2B theories. Next, we illustrate how his deployment of three scholarly competences - opportunity recognition, theory development, and theory retailing - contributed to the success of his Commitment-Trust and RA theory programs. The paper closes with a discussion of key lessons scholars and the academy can draw in crafting new indigenous marketing theories.}

Building on this work, the authors reassess the progress of marketing relative to other business disciplines by updating the citation analysis of Clark et al. (2014). The authors also take up Hunt’s third prescription for the re-institutionalization of the field as it enters Era V by offering recommendations for the reform of marketing doctoral programs. Finally, the paper takes up and extends Hunt’s seminal R-A theory and applies it to, 1) shed light on the discipline’s declining influence and competitive disadvantage, and 2) shed light on Hunt’s own success and competitive advantage as a scholar.}

An overview of paradoxical findings sets out the key issues, before a bibliometric analysis of 55 business- and management-related research articles is deployed to reveal a range of intellectual influences that have helped shape perspectives, identifying five meaningful clusters of knowledge. Related research within each cluster is then evaluated, and empirical findings discussed, alongside theoretical and conceptual development. Blind spots in CMO literature are also highlighted, and key directions are proposed for advancing research. The findings and future research avenues may help to further strengthen CMOs’ C-suite relevance.}

To address this gap, this review conducted a combination of bibliometric and thematic analyses on 861 CE articles published in 377 Scopus-indexed journals between 2006 and 2020. As a result, this review reveals the major trends in article, author, country, and journal performance, as well as the past, present, and future thematic trends of CE research, and thus, provides a one stop, state-of-the-art overview of CE that marketing scholars can rely on to position and design future CE research.}

The model, tested on multilevel data, shows that SMA and its interaction with industry munificence and dynamism are significant determinants of the relative compensation of the sales function (RCSF). Results show that innovativeness and marketing resource endowment (two dimensions of SMA) have opposite effects on RCSF. Additionally, different industry contingencies—industry munificence, dynamism, and competitiveness—interact differently with SMA when explaining RCSF. This study highlights the relevance of the sales function in firms’ pay practices and advances the understanding of variations in RCSF.}

Research presents an analysis of the most recent literature focused on digital transformation in business with special emphasis on the area of marketing.

The use of massive data, only accessible to the largest companies, is seen as an effective tool for building customer loyalty by using data generated by the customers themselves to predict their behavior as consumers. However, this same use of data also raises ethical questions which should be explored.}

The involvement of marketing managers is analyzed from a twofold perspective by considering the degree of proactivity in both change in strategy content and change in strategy processes to fill the gap identified in the literature regarding their role in strategic change. Drawing on qualitative data, the empirical investigation suggests a change agency model and uncovers the different roles performed by marketing managers. These roles materialize through four different postures in strategic change programs (i.e., pilot, advisor, expert, and synergist) with the respective dynamic managerial capabilities that marketing managers rely on in each configuration.}

Therefore, after the pandemic, the platform model has become a trend for transformation among fitness clubs to resist risks of uncertainty and expand the market for course sales. The cooperation between well-known coaches and online fitness platforms to achieve optimal pricing has gained attention in the process of transformation of fitness clubs from offline to online platforms. The platform model of fitness clubs can help online fitness platforms expand the dissemination of well-known coaches' courses and enhance the spillover effect of course popularity. We construct pricing decision models for both clubs and coaches by characterizing the consumer utility function of well-known coaches and online fitness platforms, the demand function for fitness courses in the market, and the revenue functions for clubs and coaches. We use the Shanghai Zhongtian Fitness Club in China as a case study to analyze pricing decision solutions and perform numerical experiments and sensitivity analyses on online course sales data obtained during the lockdown periods. The study found that the optimal prices for well-known coaches' courses and online fitness platforms increase with market size, indicating their ability to increase fitness course prices among potential consumers. Further, the profit level increases with market size, indicating that market expansion brings in more potential consumers and the profits gained by well-known coaches’ courses and online fitness platforms from potential consumers exceed the profits lost due to price increases; this results in an overall increase in profit level. We further conclude that online fitness platforms can use the platform pricing model of fitness clubs to transform and upgrade.}

Our research addresses this gap by studying how emotional arousal varies throughout a service encounter. Drawing from the psychology literature, we identify certain features (or patterns) that characterize how arousal varies throughout a service encounter and predict how they may affect customer approach response (e.g., spending, unplanned purchases). We explore the effect of these features in field studies in two stores using a psychophysiological measure (electrodermal activity) to capture arousal over time. We find that (1) the highest arousal level reached during the encounter and (2) the skewness of the distribution of arousal levels (i.e., the frequency of lower arousal levels relative to higher ones) predict customer approach response. This paper opens new avenues for understanding customers from an emotional perspective, which can improve the customer experience in service encounters.}

The purpose of this study is threefold: (1) to develop a rigorous BC conceptual model; (2) to provide an assessment of the BC state-of-the-art; and (3) to identify key opportunities for future research. Based on a systematic literature review, the descriptive findings indicate a decreasing number of publications since the late 2000s and that top-tier marketing journals have been almost silent since the early 90s. The domain-based findings suggest a three-layer model driving a thorough understanding of the concept, the main stages associated with BC deployment (formation, dynamics, and outcomes), and the contextual factors influencing BC decision-making.}

A theories-in-use approach, building on 56 interviews with managers at 36 B2B companies that have invested heavily in DCM, advances current literature by developing an activity-based conceptualization, grounded in relevant marketing research streams (customer engagement, customer journey and marketing technology literature). The authors also empirically derive propositions about the key contingencies of DCM performance. This conceptualization and the related contingencies provide an actionable roadmap for effective implementation of DCM for managers in business markets.}

However, social media research in B2B lacks a comprehensive overview from a strategic perspective, with most research to date having been focused on the tactical use of social media platforms, that is to say, in describing specific tools to implement a strategy. In the present systematic literature review we address this deficiency. Our findings reveal that prior B2B research predominately investigated social media as short-term tactics with context-specific limitations. Our thematic analysis extends beyond these boundaries and extracts from the literature three relationship-orientated themes in social media, namely their use as a tool for: 1) sales-facilitation, 2) integrated communication, and 3) employee engagement. These three themes are distinct yet interdependent and are each necessary if organizations are to develop a competitive advantage within the social media environment. The descriptive statistics and thematic analysis in the study present a set of five key findings that reflect the research gaps presently in the literature and thus highlight significant future research directions. The study also highlights the utility for organizations to employ social media in a strategic manner rather than simply as a tactical tool.}

However, such woke activism can lead to consumer backlash, hence carrying significant risks. Brands struggle to convince the public that their virtue-signaling efforts are authentic. Thus, this study explores the dimensions of woke branding authenticity, adopting an interpretive inductive research approach, and conducting content analysis. This study identifies six dimensions for woke activism authenticity: social context independency, inclusion, sacrifice, practice, fit, and motivation. By exploring different drivers of woke activism authenticity, this study proposes as a conceptual model, the woke activism authenticity framework, highlighting the interactions among the woke authenticity dimensions. The findings make conceptual contributions and offer several managerial recommendations toward woke authenticity and neutralizing the perception of inauthenticity.}

The manipulation examined their ethical attitudes and credibility perceptions toward the NA articles before and after the persuasion knowledge. Findings strengthen research assumptions that most adolescents have encountered NA without recognizing it as persuasive communication. Adolescents find NA articles less credible and less ethical when they are informed about it. Moreover, results show that adolescents in general have a tendency to accept NA as a moral practice, while findings point to significant differences in responses moderated by country of origin.}

A total of 250,979 tweets and 44,560 replies by 113 DMOs before and during the pandemic were carefully examined using descriptive and time series analyses, topic modelling, sentiment analysis, and principal component analysis. The findings revealed four change patterns in Twitter usage: degrade, disseminate, engage, and elevate. Topic modelling identified 19 content topics and their five trends during the pandemic: falling, rebounding, maintaining, relapsing, and rising. Additionally, the four general content strategies — emotional, functional, informational, and experiential — provided a guideline and competitive landscape for DMOs to use in planning and devising their marketing communication strategies to handle such a shock. This study effectively addresses several research gaps, including the dearth of longitudinal, cross-country, and supply-side studies on crisis communications in tourism. As such, it enriches the existing body of knowledge by taking a comprehensive look at the diverse communication executions and strategies during both regular periods and crises. In doing so, it bridges the gap between theories of crisis communications and general social media communication strategies employed by DMOs.}

Due to this, a categorical regression model was performed to test the hypotheses. The results showed that the industry analysis is more relevant for those companies that adopt a mature market strategy. The analysis of consumer buying behavior and the analysis of market demand dynamics prevail in the new markets strategy. Although product differentiation to achieve positioning is an important driver for companies that use growth market strategies, it is concluded that the consumer buying behavior hypothesis is valid because the analysis allows implementing differentiation actions that are included in strategic control, which is a complex thought process developed by top management.}

While AI advertising literature dates to the 1990s, the field has experienced a surge in research attention and development in recent years, presenting varied potential avenues for future research. Despite this progress, understanding of the evolution of AI advertising research remains limited, and a state-of-the-art overview is required to advance future research. To address this gap, this review aims to map the field's evolution by conducting a bibliometric and framework-based analysis of 75 AI advertising articles published between 1990 and 2022. The study's key findings are the publication trends in AI advertising, TCCM classification, and research contexts identified through bibliographic coupling. Four themes emerged as key focus areas of AI advertising research: programmatic advertising and automation, ad planning and engagement, advertising effectiveness, and trust in AI advertising. In addition, this review offers practical guidelines and future research directions for developing AI advertising literature. Lastly, the review suggests broader implications for industry and academia, highlighting how the identified themes can inform advertising practice and contribute to the theoretical development of the field.}

However, such inclusivity initiatives can lead to consumer backlash when luxury brands rely on perfectionism and self-esteem to elicit admiration and desirability. We ask whether weaving models with disabilities into brand narratives contributes to positive consumer responses. Using signaling theory, our study employs a structural equation modeling approach to show that, despite the negative effect of perceived brand inclusivity on consumers’ willingness to buy, the serial mediation by transportation into brand stories and advertising credibility flips the effect to positive. By doing so, this study also extends extant literature on inclusive advertising in luxury fashion by going beyond dominant manifestations of inclusivity tackling feminism and LGBTQAI + rights.}

In turn, these three streams have implications for the controversies over whether strategy's focus should be “outside-in or inside-out” and whether strategy should be static or dynamic. This article addresses the three streams of strategic thought and the two controversies by (1) explicating their nature, (2) showing how strategies related to them have evolved through time, and (3) pointing toward the controversies' resolution. The article argues that all theories of strategy assume a theory of how competition works. In turn, theories of competition are housed within disciplinary research traditions. Therefore, understanding the controversies in contemporary strategy is furthered by understanding both the theories of competition that underlie each strategic approach and their respective research traditions.}

Based on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and Risk-Benefit Models, the electric vehicle (EV) purchase decision is modeled as primarily based on beliefs of the perceived benefits and the perceived risks of technology adoption and social influences. Further, beliefs of a manufacturer's expertise and trustworthiness were found to reduce consumer risk concerns and strengthen consumer conviction that the benefits of technology were attainable. Structural equation modeling of survey data confirm the proposed consumer decision model, and our contention that technology adoption can be better understood by specifically exploring discordant consumer beliefs of the post-purchase consequences. The results of our research provide a new understanding of salient consumer risk and benefit beliefs when consumers face new technologies that represent a paradigm shift. Results also provide insight for technology firms that need to constantly develop new strategic marketing actions designed to increase demand for their complex technological products.}

abstract = {In an age where online shopping permeates daily life, the cascading influences originating from parasocial interactions play a pivotal role in steering consumers’ purchase decisions. This research delves deep into the interplay of parasocial interaction, vicarious expression, electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM), and the bandwagon effect, all converging towards influencing online purchase intention. Through two controlled quasi-experiments—with 232 participants in Study 1 and 252 in Study 2—we offer a fresh perspective rooted in parasocial relationship theory. Study 1 delineates how parasocial interactions heighten the impact of vicarious expressions, leading to amplified bandwagon effect and pronounced eWOM. The study further corroborates the mediating role of vicarious expression between parasocial interaction and the bandwagon effect. Study 2 sheds light on the cyclical nature of this process, illustrating that eWOM, in turn, reinforces the bandwagon effect, driving online purchase intention. These findings underscore the potent influence of parasocial interactions on online purchasing behaviors, suggesting that brands can strategically leverage such interactions to enhance eWOM and harness the bandwagon effect. Moreover, recognizing the cyclical reinforcement between eWOM and the bandwagon effect offers marketers a unique opportunity to amplify and sustain online purchase momentum.}

abstract = {Tactical sales forecasting is fundamental to production, transportation and personnel decisions at all levels of a supply chain. Traditional forecasting methods extrapolate historical sales information to predict future sales. As a result, these methods are not capable of anticipating macroeconomic changes in the business environment that often have a significant impact on the demand. To account for these macroeconomic changes, companies adjust either their statistical forecast manually or rely on an expert forecast. However, both approaches are notoriously biased and expensive. This paper investigates the use of leading macroeconomic indicators in the tactical sales forecasting process. A forecasting framework is established that automatically selects the relevant variables and predicts future sales. Next, the seasonal component is predicted by the seasonal naive method and the long-term trend using a LASSO regression method with macroeconomic indicators, while keeping the size of the indicator’s set as small as possible. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed framework is evaluated by quantifying the impact of each individual component. The carried out analysis has shown that the proposed framework achieves a reduction of 54.5% in mean absolute percentage error when compared to the naive forecasting method. Moreover, compared to the best performing conventional methods, a reduction of 25.6% is achieved in the tactical time window over three different real-life case studies from different geographical areas.}

This study examines online event experiences and their effects on consumers’ behavioural intentions towards mega events. Using a sample of 1726 participants from four countries (United States, United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa), a structural equation model was conducted. Results indicate that online content engagement and effective communication influence consumers’ online experience and positively affects their behavioural intentions towards the event. Online consumer-to-consumer interaction also showed a positive effect on consumers’ future behavioural intentions. The findings highlight the need for event organisers to reconsider the rising importance of consumers who are likely to follow the event online and to understand the factors that shape their online experience.}

Using data partitioning on a random sample of 323 consumers to generate usable cases for three interrelated studies, the paper reports that the effects of possession- and social inclusion-defined materialism are consistently accentuated in the purchase of luxury goods rather than economical goods, whereby consumers with high levels of possession- and social inclusion-defined materialism are more likely to purchase luxury goods than consumers with low levels of possession- and social inclusion-defined materialism. However, the paper finds that possession- and social inclusion-defined materialism have no significant effects on the individual and group patronage of economical and luxury services.

Specifically, PLB hinders (improves) the performance of low (high) product equity brands. Then Study 2 identifies two drivers of PLB effectiveness, product attribute differences and competitive intensity, that have contrasting influences for brands with high versus low product equity. These influences exert long-term, cumulative effects (i.e., over 104 weeks). To ensure the generalizability and applicability of the findings, this research effort spans a vast consumer scanner data set, involving 268 brand panels, 14 product categories, and three retailers.

This article analyzes international partner selection scenarios using agent-based simulations in Iran's biopharmaceutical industry. In line with the goal of this research, a complete understanding of the failure and success of collaboration product innovation is presented. First, the critical/key success factors (KSFs) in international strategic alliances were identified through a literature review (LR) and screened via Fuzzy Delphi. Next, selected factors were weighted by fuzzy SWARA (Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis) and considered as simulation inputs for international partner selection. The simulation results indicated the critical role of the knowledge-matching degree and complementary resources and the insignificant impact of the company's reputation, government support, and experience in the international alliance. Furthermore, we found that pharmaceutical and biotech companies should emphasize their partner's complementary resources and develop an evaluation system to measure the knowledge-matching degree of their foreign partners in ISA. Eventually, this paper provides practical and applied solutions for biopharmaceutical industry managers to analyze business partners. The article also adds to the debate on ISAs in biopharmaceutical industries.}

A field data set and two online experiments show that consumers are more prepared to share personal information with the brand when experiencing brand personnel betrayals than when experiencing other types of service or brand failures. The effect is mediated by consumers’ social affirmation mindset and moderated by privacy concerns.}

abstract = {This research examines how the adjustment of price and delay in the sequential distribution of simultaneously available digital products can maximize revenues. In this dynamic digital market, consumers can choose between different versions of movies that are available after their initial theatrical release. An analysis of weekly sales data of 1,397 movies with more than 50,000 observations, in a random effect control function generalized least square panel model, reveals an inverted U-shaped delay effect. That is, too short and too long delays after the initial cinematic release are both suboptimal. Price and delay interact positively with each other too, such that if the delay is too short, the negative influence of the price becomes amplified. By testing the effects of multiple other success factors, some of which have not been investigated before, this research also reveals pertinent, novel interactions of these variables with price and delay. Finally, to encourage the practical application of these comprehensive results, the authors present an interactive dashboard that managers can use to simulate the optimal price and delay for the different product versions.}

This study contributes to the B2B service innovation literature by uncovering challenges and opportunities that technology suppliers face during the service innovation process and their partnership with service providers. We identify five groups of challenges/opportunities: (1) B2B partners’ level of knowledge, (2) B2B partners’ involvement in the back/front end, (3) B2B partners’ market approach, (4) the impact of B2B partners’ organizational processes, and (5) B2B partners’ business interactions.

Building on the premise, previous literature primarily examined the causal relationships to describe the phenomenon of evolving digital payment technology in a varied context. However, limited studies explored user classification and profiling with some exceptions, principally stressing upon barely online and mobile-based banking segmentation contexts. Grounded in analyzing user taxonomy based on benefits-trust-behavioral linkage model from the purview of an emerging mobile-based digital payment market, this research aims to identify and test an a-priori approach to market segmentation of FMP platform users and profiling them based on perceived benefits, behavioral, and socio-demographic characterization. To analyze the model of users' classification, 550 valid online responses were received and employed a blended analytical approach of multivariate techniques (CFA, cluster analysis, discriminant function analysis) along with the bivariate technique of the Chi-square test for clustering procedures followed by resulting clusters' validation and their profiling. The three distinct segments are identified as ‘The Fintech Dubious,’ ‘The Cash Conservatives, ‘and ‘The Fintech Enthusiasts.’ The study also advances the current theoretical understanding of the trust based modified version of UTAUT with the associative framework of ‘perceived benefits-attitude, and intention’ by adding two additional cognitive constructs of perceived trust and perceived price value along with added socio-demographics (usage frequency and geographical area). Lastly, this timely study offers several unflinching implications for the practitioners of strategic marketing and policymakers for encouraging FMP usage.}

Subsequently, for the main part, adopting a design scientific approach and relying on web demographics' interoperability and geographic reference, we design and test a procedure of market-shaping strategy for ethnic ventures. Exemplified by a data subset collected from people-finder websites regarding Vietnamese Americans in Texas, our process of mixed business model and market-shaping strategy uniquely involves three stages: (1) acquisition and identification, (2) description and secondary clustering, and (3) conscription and network-targeting.}

Using a longitudinal dataset (2010–2017) containing 360 market offerings and 39 acquisitions of Facebook and Twitter, we benchmark one PBO against another under temporal contingency. Our analysis reveals that PBOs that cater to multiple stakeholders in digital ecosystems use service innovations as part of their conformity (legitimacy argument of institutional theory) efforts and ecosystem facilitation as part of their differentiating (unique positioning and competitive distinction argument of strategic management) efforts. In addition, we find that PBOs that can better use their digital ecosystems for structural flexibility, controlled structural integrity, shared worldview, and reduced cognitive dissonance are likely to outperform those who do not. We discuss the implications of this research for PBOs, different user groups utilizing such PBOs.

The present conceptual research addresses this research gap by developing a comprehensive typology that explicates and unpacks the full variety of consumer involvement types in supply networks of contemporary business models. The three-dimensional typology developed contributes to literature by identifying and integrating the relevant dimensions, which have been addressed in prior research only implicitly or in a piecemeal manner. This elucidates the full range and variety of the phenomenon to researchers. For managers, the three-dimensional, cubic typology offers a business development tool, facilitating the identification of altogether 56 alternative business models, wherein consumers may serve as suppliers of various inputs, including work, effort, and entrepreneurial activity; goods; platform goods; natural resources and energy; data, information, and knowledge; attention and presence; as well as money and capital.}

In Study 1, 368 YouBike users' perspectives were examined, and the results showed that ease of use is key to promoting WOM through perceived value and brand image. Furthermore, based on 338 GoShare users' perspectives in Study 2, brand image and reputation are shown to play the critical mediating roles in linking the relationships between marketing strategy and WOM.

In this paper, we develop a new metric based on the diffusion modeling framework that can help in assessing the prediction accuracy of T*. This metric is built on the premise that observed sales growth is affected both by the force that systematically varies with time and by the non-systematic random forces. We show that the two forces must be carefully combined to assess if a predicted T* is accurate enough. In addition, we empirically prove the efficacy of the proposed metric.}

However, direct customers' demand for business marketers' offerings is often ‘derived demand’, i.e., heavily influenced by the needs of their own downstream customers. Consequently, scholars suggest that marketers may benefit from incorporating these customers' customer needs as a third segmentation base, distinct from but possibly interrelated to the two bases of direct customers' needs and behaviors. However, extant joint segmentation models are limited to two-bases. Focusing on the addition of a third customers' customer needs basis, a new B2B joint segmentation model is proposed, allowing for three interrelated segmentation bases. The model is first validated in Monte Carlo simulation studies and then applied to segmenting the business customers (advertisers) of a US newspaper publisher seeking to enable more precisely targeted selling effort allocation and communications strategies. The model uncovered joint segments of business customers based on their behaviors, needs, and downstream customers' needs. Results demonstrate the advantage of the model that yields actionable segments of customers with similar downstream customer needs. Finally, model relevance and feasibility in contemporary B2B markets is confirmed in a qualitative study with experts in various industries.}

Drawing on relational exchange theory, this study explores the effects of buyer trust asymmetry and supplier trust asymmetry on changes in supplier opportunism over time, and further examines the moderating roles of legal support and regulatory uncertainty. Empirical results from 229 buyer–supplier dyads in China reveal that when buyer trust surpasses supplier trust, trust asymmetry leads to increased supplier opportunism over time; yet when the supplier’s trust exceeds that of the buyer, trust asymmetry results in decreased supplier opportunism. Moreover, legal support weakens the effects of buyer and supplier trust asymmetry, and regulatory uncertainty magnifies the influence of buyer trust asymmetry. Our findings shed light on the complexity of interfirm trust and the dark side of business-to-business relationships, offering valuable insights for relationship marketing research.}

We observe that the appeal of an NPPA differs for retail and institutional investors. Utilizing prospect theory, we argue that the two types of investors face unequal levels of uncertainty and are dissimilarly loss averse due to varying levels of knowledge and access to resources. This results in varying attitudes towards investment horizon, risk-taking, and preference for information sources. We find investor proclivity toward an NPPA depends on several factors, including the short-term abnormal return, the valence of coverage in media and analyst reports, the firm's risk profile, and the exploration emphasis of the firm. Moreover, we show that higher levels of institutional ownership ultimately contribute to new product success. The results hold implications for strategies that managers can employ to increase investor ownership within the firm to fund innovation.}

Two follow traditional or incremental internationalization pathways, whilst the other two pursue rapid or accelerated internationalization. The study offers a more dynamic perspective to help understand the evolving nature of ambidexterity with respect to the routes of strategic product and market development options. In particularly, the findings reveal that incremental internationalization is characterized by structural ambidexterity combining product exploitation with market exploration at the initial stages, whereas accelerated internationalization is best explained by market exploration and exploitation (or market ambidexterity) when first entering foreign markets. Moreover, firms were found to maintain strategic priorities through structural and punctuated ambidexterity across product and market domains at later stages of internationalization. This study contributes to the dynamic perspective of strategic ambidexterity for seizing international opportunities among emerging market firms.}

This article offers an overview of the development of academic literature published between 2010 and 2019 with regards to the relationship between digitalization and business models in 198 peer-reviewed articles. By applying a novel methodological approach to compare results from different bibliometric analyses, such as the analysis of citations, co-citations, bibliographic coupling, and co-occurrences of keywords, we have identified the most influential journals, authors, and articles, as well as three thematic clusters (technological innovation, strategic management, and digital transformation). For each cluster, the most relevant contributions are presented. Promising research areas and future research directions are identified to address the existing gaps in knowledge.}

Thus, developing an understanding of how to enhance user perceptions and behaviors through interface design has become crucial. Using affordance theory and service-dominant logic as theoretical lenses, this study examines how chatbot affordances affect consumers' continuance intention through value-in-use. Data collected from 405 chatbot users of selected banks were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results reveal that chatbot affordances positively influence personalization and experience. Furthermore, personalization influences switching costs and psychological ownership, whereas experience affects psychological ownership. Moreover, switching costs affect continuance intention through inattentiveness to alternatives. Finally, psychological ownership influences customer citizenship behavior, which impacts continuance intention.}

We describe how B2B brands can use the rhetorical elements of logos, pathos, and ethos to achieve an advantageous position within their field's discourse. We identify B2B brand reputation, awareness, and credibility among the benefits of having a brand legitimacy within a network of actors and provide propositions and empirical guides to substantiate the proposed framework.}

While marketing research generally indicates that these investments should pay off, recent experiences from managerial practice suggest that such beneficial payoffs may not necessarily arise. To examine the effects of implementing IDSTs on B2B firm performance, we differentiate between customer-sensing and customer-linking IDSTs: while customer-sensing IDST has the primary purpose of identifying new sales opportunities (e.g., predictive analytics) early within the B2B sales funnel, the purpose of customer-linking IDST (e.g., augmented reality application) is to close sales opportunities. The results of a multi-data study involving 314 B2B firms confirm that implementing customer-sensing and customer-linking IDST can exhibit a complementary, positive effect on firm profit, but this effect strongly varies with the sales task environment in terms of firms’ offering and demand complexity. In unfavorable conditions, extensive digitalization in B2B sales can even harm firm profit. These findings contribute to sales technology research and the literature on marketing capabilities and guide managers on how to ensure successful sales digitalization.}

By considering the theories, contexts, characteristics, and methodologies used in LP research, this study (1) paints the most comprehensive picture of the field to date and (2) develops a future research agenda to help advance the field further. Our review reveals that existing studies mostly rely on status-based, inertia-based, or relationship-based mechanisms to theoretically explain LP-related effects, while multi-theoretical perspectives are rare. LP research focuses strongly on a few key industries, such as retail, airlines, and hotels, but lacks insights into the design and outcomes of LPs in online and B2B contexts. Furthermore, we diagnose a need for more research on the role of competition among LPs and the impact of recent technological advances on LP management.}

However, little attention has been given to how the individual influencers' use of multiple social networking sites affects their followers' behavioral intentions. Hence, this academic gap warrants further exploration. Drawing on cue consistency theory, social identity theory, and stimulus-organism-response framework, this research proposes three research questions and constructs an integrated research model to explore how the influencers' cue consistency affects the social identification of their followers, subsequently influencing their behavioral intentions. A structural equation modeling technique is performed to analyze the data of 510 valid respondents. The findings show that influencers' consistent cues (i.e., information and image consistency) across social media have positive impacts on followers' cognitive and affective identification toward the influencers. Furthermore, the determinants for followers' purchase intention and electronic word-of-mouth intention are affirmed to serve as both cognitive and affective identification. Especially, the results indicate that the relationships between followers’ social identifications and behavioral intentions are moderated by the type of influencer (i.e., lifestyle vs. review). Accordingly, the results indicate how the use of multiple social networking sites by influencers impacts the behavioral intentions of their followers. The findings offer new insights into influencer marketing and provide important lessons for marketers.}

Data from 482 respondents in the age group of 18 years to 30 years (the young consumers) from India was analyzed for social media influence on different cognitive stages of mobile banking acceptance. Results show the increasing tendency of social media influence with increasing cognitive level. Among the four cognitive stages (Attention, Interest, Desire, and Action- AIDA model) of m-banking adoption, Action and Interest stages are the most influenced stages by the social media, followed by Desire and Attention. This research provides a two-stage analytical approach by combining “SEM and NN” to assess the impact of the integration of AIDA constructs.

But the outcomes of greater reliance on AI in peer-to-peer marketplaces, also known as lateral exchange markets (LEMs), might differ. Deploying AI likely improves outcomes for buyers and sellers (separately), as well as the effectiveness of their matching. In contrast, contingencies related to the power of the LEM and the presence and interaction of buyers and sellers (consociality) may evoke a dark side of AI. Guided by literature on LEMs, AI, and agency theory, the current work establishes buy- and sell-side tensions that arise when LEMs deploy AI. With a unique focus on buyers and sellers (cf. platforms) in LEMs and careful attention to the dark side, as well as the bright side, of AI, this article offers novel perspectives and implications for research and practice.}

This study introduces a novel synthesis of Signaling theory and Stewardship theory and examines the moderating impact of brand governance on the relationship between green brand identity, consistent communication and channel partner commitment, leading to tactical green marketing orientation. Distinguishing itself from previous research, our approach embraces a multi-perspective lens, delving into the viewpoints of both channel partners and organizations (i.e., managers). Employing an explanatory sequential mixed method design, the first phase involved an empirical survey with 248 respondents (Study 1). Subsequently, the second phase (Study 2) comprised qualitative interviews with 41 respondents. The findings from both studies converged, revealing a positive association between “consistent communication” and “attitude,” a robust connection between “attitude” and “commitment,” and a favorable correlation between “green brand identity” and “attitude,” ultimately leading to a positive relationship between “attitude” and “green tactical marketing orientation". This research significantly contributes to the comprehension of B2B green brand positioning by demonstrating, that in the B2B context, brand governance influences channel partners' commitment and tactical green marketing orientation.}

However, since the conversion rate of distributed coupons into coupons redeemed for purchase is relatively low, there is a need to understand the redemption decisions of consumers. Lower conversion rates lead businesses to lose both customers and profits. Previous studies have typically focused on social couponing from a business perspective, without exploring factors from the customer's end. The current study explores the factors influencing customers' decision to redeem coupons and highlights the interrelationships between the factors. Data were collected from 353 online customers on their redemption experiences during their food purchases. Structural equation modeling was performed to examine the significance of the factors and establish the predictability of customers' redemption decisions. We then explored different machine learners to identify the best-fitting models for customers' redemption decisions. Results showed that the prediction accuracy of the decision-tree-based models was the highest. These models delineate the role of influencers in various redemption aspects and validate the mediation effects of perceived risk, deal proneness, referral, and consumption frequency. The study also highlights future research areas in the social couponing domain.}

Drawing on the insights from in-depth interviews (n = 18), focus group discussions (n = 15), a pilot survey (n = 83) and the main survey (n = 344) in Australia, we developed and validated an affordance actualisation model for the engagement and use of e-textbooks. The partial least squares (PLS) technique was used to validate the dimensions of affordance actualisation and its relationship with e-textbooks engagement and affordance effect. The findings indicate the efficacy of the two affordance constructs, as well as the significant mediating effect of engagement. An important lesson for the e-textbook industry is that firms need to consider affordance actualisation dimensions (i.e., portability, accessibility, searchability, highlighting, copying, browsing, hedonic and utilitarian value) when enhancing digital engagement and use of e-textbooks.}

Our study examines how these processes impact pioneering orientation, firms' emphasis on launching innovative products ahead of competitors, in business-to-business (B2B) small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The prevailing view is firms should simultaneously pursue both processes or focus on just one. We challenge this notion and posit B2B SMEs should generally prioritise one process over the other to effectively shape pioneering orientation. However, certain circumstances like upstream supply chain (SC) integration and strong information technology (IT) competence enable firms to optimise benefits by alternating between processes. Our longitudinal analysis of 213 Chinese B2B SMEs supports this argument, revealing marketing exploration has a stronger positive influence on pioneering orientation than exploitation. Furthermore, our analysis shows upstream SC integration alone does not moderate, but combined with robust IT competence, can increase the advantages of marketing exploitation over exploration when fostering pioneering orientation in B2B SMEs.}

Empowered by AI, voice assistants are increasingly capable of speaking and listening like humans, offering a great opportunity for a new marketing approach - voice marketing. This research examines how conversation attributes of voice assistants determine consumer trust and intention to engage in voice shopping. Using a sequential mixed-method design, three studies consistently show that consumers perceive the speaking attribute of voice assistants as more human-like than the listening attribute. We find that such incongruency between the two conversation attributes can undermine consumers' trust in voice assistants, leading to reduced willingness to accept product recommendations from voice assistants and shop via voice assistants, which would hamper the development of voice marketing. Accordingly, this research suggests that AI giants with strong technological strength and capital support should distribute more resources to advance the underlying technologies enabling human-like listening (e.g., natural language understanding and voice recognition). But for AI startups with limited financing ability and technical talents, they may consider appropriately reducing investments in the underlying technologies enabling human-like speaking (e.g., natural language generation and voice synthesis) to enhance the congruency level between the conversation attributes of voice assistants.}

R&D Centers assume responsibility for the identification, selection, acquisition, development, and transfer of technology. Among their activities, the successful selection of new technologies is becoming a highly critical and complex challenge in the Technology Management Process. The problem underlying the right selection of new generations of technologies is, from a methodological perspective, linked to key heterogeneous (technological, economic, human, and organizational) factors. Even though previous research has focused on the selection of technologies within the industrial sector, there is little research on the selection of technology at R&D Institutions and, in particular, at R&D Centers. In this research, a Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)-based evaluation model for decision-making (MIVES), adaptable to one or several technologies, is therefore, employed. In such complex scenarios, MCDM models are a suitable approach to decision-making. The model is then applied to a real case study, in which the evaluation of a new technology at a Spanish R&D Center specializing in manufacturing is analyzed.}

In Study 1, we utilised cross-sectional data collected from 468 managers from various industries. In study 2, we employed longitudinal data in a three-wave longitudinal utilising a cross-lagged panel model. Study 1 indicated that data acquisition and tool acquisition are key drivers in adopting marketing analytics. Marketing analytics use has stronger effect on customer agility when market turbulence is high. They also revealed that the influence of customer agility on customer satisfaction in such conditions is stronger. Study 2 revealed that marketing analytics use at time point T1 has a significant and positive influence on customer agility at time point T2, while customer agility at time point T2 has a significant and positive influence on customer satisfaction at time point T3. These findings indicate strong temporal effects between marketing analytics use, customer agility, and customer satisfaction. The findings suggest that researchers should look beyond direct effects of marketing analytics use and shift their attention on how a marketing analytics can be leveraged to enable and support dynamic capabilities and customer satisfaction.}

This study explores managers' capacity to manage the inherent paradox of coopetition, focusing on the managerial framings and the various contextual factors shaping them. While the importance of coopetition-oriented mindsets, paradoxical frames, and cognitive and emotional capabilities is recognized for successful management of these challenges, more research is needed to understand how individual managers frame coopetition. The framing perspective is important, because it shows how managers make sense of and try to influence their own behavior as well as that of others. Utilizing a qualitative approach, we analyzed 26 interviews with top managers from 24 organizations within the same healthcare ecosystem. As a result, we develop a framework outlining three distinct paths to framing coopetition: conscious denial, acceptance, and unconscious denial, along with five specific framings. Our findings highlight the impact of these framings on managers' ability to manage coopetition effectively and the conditions shaping the different framings. Through these insights, this research advances our understanding of coopetition management and underscores the crucial role of context, enriching both theoretical discourse and practical application.}

abstract = {The aim of this study to investigate factors affecting luxury consumers’ webrooming intention using a moderated mediation framework. The study also investigates the mediating effects of perceived hedonic value and perceived utilitarian value and how these mediating effects are moderated by online risk perceptions. Data were collected using offline survey from 374 luxury consumers in India, using systematic sampling. The results indicated that perceived usefulness of online search, need for touch and socialization have significant impact on webrooming intention. Perceived hedonic value and perceived utilitarian value mediate the effect of variables on webrooming intention and mediation effect of perceived utilitarian value varied between high and low levels of online risk perceptions. Findings of this study will help luxury retailers in managing consumer channel switching behaviour. The study enriches luxury marketing literature by examining emerging webrooming, channel switching phenomenon.}

This research extends the current knowledge on the B2B buying phenomenon by undertaking a broad literature review and offering a comprehensive agenda for future research. In particular, the paper focuses on the emerging use of concepts, theories, and frameworks from the consumer behavior (CB) literature to explain B2B buyer behavior. This approach represents a much-needed evolution in B2B buying research that breaks from the traditional research perspectives that have guided B2B buying research to date. Hence, this research addresses three goals: First, it reviews B2B buying studies in specialty B2B marketing journals and FT-50 marketing strategy journals to identify the predominant themes that guide the research in this stream of literature. Second, it assesses the use of CB theories and frameworks in grounding empirical examinations of B2B buying phenomenon. Third, the paper sets out a prospective agenda that highlights various research propositions related to B2B buying by leveraging key themes in the CB literature that are relevant to B2B buyer behavior research.}

Lexicometric analysis shows that the key themes of network marketing research are formats of network marketing and their characteristics, membership norms, and outcomes of network marketing. Theoretically, this systematic literature review (SLR) synthesizes the network marketing literature from multifarious perspectives and proposes a conceptual framework. Further, it contributes to advancing the network marketing domain by proposing future research directions in terms of theoretical underpinnings, characteristics, contexts, and methods.

Using the ripple effects and bullwhip effects literature as its underlying theoretical foundation, this paper uses longitudinal data from the apparel industry to analyze the advertising differences among the major suppliers of a supply chain (SC) system holistically using a bilinear mixed model. The results support the presence of the ripple effect of advertising and suggest that advertising should be better coordinated across supply chain members to reduce operational and financial inefficiencies.}

The study here describes SOSDE in poultry products manufacturing but the propositions advanced are applicable across a wide span of industries. This study contributes by integrating prior organizational mental models, production economics, industrial marketing, and systems engineering principles in empirical applications. This study demonstrates the manufacturing design possibilities for simultaneously achieving high financial performance and high ESG (environment, social, and governance) performances by phasing in production innovations and converting production wastes into profitable new products.}

To answer this question, this research mobilises the theory of embodiment, the theory of community commitment and the sense of social belonging to explain the behaviour of the embodied gamer. Using a sample of 567 players of massively multiplayer online role-playing games in virtual reality, our study establishes conclusive evidence that player embodiment influences player purchase behaviour. Furthermore, our results reveal the presence of a mediating effect between embodiment and the purchase of virtual objects. In other words, players buy virtual objects because embodiment reinforces their commitment and their sense of belonging to their community. Clearly, this research is the first to propose this model in the field of online multiplayer games. Professionals should exploit these groundbreaking results and democratise virtual reality in games. In addition, it is important that the virtual interfaces deployed in games are more engaging, personalised and community-based.}

The authors empirically investigate the model through a cross-sectional survey of 141 Taiwanese electronics firms. Drawing from the coalignment perspective, these firms are distinguished into four strategic groups labeled as EO (high EO and low AO), AO (low EO and high AO), EA (high EO and high AO), and CO (low EO and low AO) firms. Empirical results suggest that the four groups of firms significantly differ in terms of NPD process characteristics (decision-making flexibility, market-focused learning, and internally focused learning), program characteristics (product program meaningfulness and newness), and performance outcome (new product success). Theoretical and managerial implications of the results are demonstrated.}

Service firms aspire to achieve a distinctive vision through service transformation, often engaging technology and digitalization as critical partners in creating long-term firm success in the market by nurturing enhanced customer and stakeholder benefits. Therefore, it is imperative for us to examine, understand, and seek ways in which transformation can be utilized effectively by service firms. A new conceptualization is proposed that highlights how service transformation can follow many strategic paths, ranging from a relatively minor linear evolutionary reformation of service offerings to a cyclical and ongoing complete creative destruction and reincarnation of the firm. This manuscript first proposes an organizing framework to understand the internal and external factors that have the potential to render service transformation achievable, as well as the range of internal and external outcomes that can result from successful transformation. We then draw upon theories of evolution to delineate the process of transformation over time in service contexts, resulting in a conceptual model of service transformation that articulates three viable pathways to service transformation, which we call the “3Rs of Service Transformation” – reformation, renovation, and reincarnation. We define and provide examples of these three paths of service transformation and identify situations and contexts in which each approach may be most appropriate for certain firms. We conclude with a discussion of future research directions.}

The method comprises of two main components: spatial co-location pattern mining and locationGCN, where locationGCN is based on graph convolutional network (GCN). The spatial co-location pattern mining is utilized to capture the spatial correlation of specific restaurant to determine the candidate location selection range. The locationGCN is designed to further screen out final suitable location ranges for the specific restaurant type. A case study using restaurant data from Xiamen Island collected from Dianping.com is conducted. The empirical results demonstrate that the algorithm achieves an accuracy of 74.88%, precision of 63.59%, and recall of 77.48%. Results indicate that the proposed approach can provide suitable location recommendations for specific types of restaurants based on existing restaurant distribution information.}

NPS has been claimed to be a superior predictor of sales growth, which has led to widespread managerial adoption. However, academia criticized the NPS calculation because it sets arbitrary cut-off points, excludes parts of the sample, and collapses the scale into three categories; leading to calls for its abandonment. Our study explores these criticisms by systematically comparing NPS with six alternative calculation methods based on the LTR question (including alternative NPS calculations, LTR ‘top-box’, and average metrics) using 193,220 responses for seven sportswear brands. The study establishes that while NPS performs well in a comparative assessment of calculation methods, ‘top-box’ metrics perform better, undermining claims that NPS is the one number managers need to grow. In practice, managers could continue to use NPS, but there are better alternatives.}

Authenticity exerts the most influence in the field of politics, followed by music, movies, and sports. In social media and business, human brand authenticity shows no significance toward brand love. Although existing branding scholarship identifies authenticity as a predictor of positive marketing outcomes, the current study’s findings uncover a boundary condition concerning the context in which the human brand performs. In addition, brand love can be materialized through increased purchase intention of human brands’ self-branded products, allowing the human brand to benefit from passive income and brand-building opportunities.}

Adopting a mixed-method approach, comprising a quantitative survey among 323 consumers in the UK and India and a qualitative study among 18 British consumers, we found that extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness positively affect consumer fair trade engagement, whereas neuroticism has a negative effect, and openness has no significant impact. Consumer fair trade engagement was subsequently revealed to positively influence ethically-minded behavior related to circular economy. The association between consumer fair trade engagement and ethically-minded behavior was stronger in older, more educated, and high-income consumers, whereas gender had no moderating role.}

Consequently, the present study investigates the effects of customer-perceived CSR and firm innovativeness on financial earnings, both in the short and long term. Firm actions, if meaningful, should impact customer perceptions of a firm, which affect customer satisfaction and the firm’s earnings consequently. Using panel data from service firms, our analysis indicates that perceived firm actions positively influence future earnings through customers’ overall evaluations of a firm. Furthermore, the results reveal a carryover effect of perceived actions in the long term. The present research also indicates that customers’ positive perceptions of firm actions do not directly impact financial earnings; however, they do impact earnings through customer satisfaction. This emphasizes the importance of communicating innovation, and particularly CSR activities, to customers.}

To address these questions, we develop a conceptual framework identifying the key drivers of B2B buyer acceptance of luxury brands using sustainable materials. These drivers are categorized as brand-related, product-related, market-related, consumer-related, and country-related factors, alongside climate change risk as a key moderator. Additionally, the framework examines moderating factors, such as the price of the product, level of involvement, and other potential influences. Integrating academic research with managerial insights, this paper contributes to the growing body of literature on climate change, sustainability, and B2B marketing, offering a comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics between sustainability and luxury branding in B2B contexts.}

Using the naturalistic decision-making approach and the situative perspective on cognition and action as theoretical lenses, we identify three key characteristics of decision-making in modern marketing environments—namely, agility, inventiveness, and reflexiveness. Our findings provide empirically grounded insights into the cognitive and behavioral processes involved in marketing decision-making and contribute to a deeper understanding of how managers navigate—and respond to—modern marketing environments’ challenges.}

As product suppliers can no longer secure their competitive position through former product-related competitive advantages, more complex product offerings and integrated solutions consisting of products and services, so-called “product-service systems (PSS)”, are increasingly being offered. But how can PSS implementation and the digital servitization transformation process be successfully accomplished? This paper addresses this research question and examines the transformation process of several companies using a mixed-methods approach that includes the evaluation of objective data-based efficiency for an idealized servitization path. The study shows how important it is for companies to maintain or even strengthen former product-based competitive advantages and to build on them to develop new business areas. It also shows that companies are simultaneously implementing bi-directional product support services and customer support services. In addition, data-oriented services such as condition monitoring and remote services are proving to be the basis for offering more complex performance- and results-oriented PSS, where customers pay per unit produced rather than fixed fees. Moreover, for the first time, it can be concluded that digital services are the basis for the successful establishment of digital industrial IoT platforms.}

It is theorized that this disposition is a function of developing a sense of psychological ownership towards luxury brands (POLB) and antecedents explaining this state are proposed. Data collected from users engaged in borrowing and renting luxury is used to test the theoretical model. Results indicate that perceived control over accessed brands, intimate knowledge of these brands, and self-investment in these brands predict POLB. POLB further impacts the accessed brands’ equity appraised in the form of brands’ continuous usage and willingness to pay more. Notably, the access type moderates the influence of proposed predictors on POLB. The study contributes to the literature on luxury consumption through access and extends the applications of PO theory in a sharing economy.

User-generated social media communication continues to increase: to the detriment of traditional media channels, where the message is controlled by destination marketing organizations. Moreover, uncontrolled user-generated communication is increasingly considered more reliable than traditional, controlled communication. All this has considerably modified tourist perceptions regarding destination image and brand equity. From a business perspective, a line of thought addressing the study of these interrelationships has emerged in the literature, going so far as to consider their impact on brand engagement. Despite the current prevalence and relevance of social media communication as a loyalty-building factor in a context as competitive as the tourism sector, relatively little literature has addressed it in emerging tourist destination scenarios. Hence, the present paper presents an analysis of how – and to what extent – social media communication, both controlled and uncontrolled by the destination organization, has an impact on destination brand equity and destination brand engagement. More specifically, this study applies it to an emerging economy scenario: Metropolitan Lima, Peru. The implications of our research, presented at the end of the paper, are of interest – both as a contribution to the literature and from the perspective of tourist destination management – and can serve to aid the economic and social development of emerging economies.}

The purpose of this study is to propose a framework to identify determinant attributes from online consumer questions. Our method uses semi-supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify product attributes initially. This is followed by the application of sequence pattern mining to identify temporal sequences of determinant attributes. Finally, hierarchical time series is used to forecast consumer interest in determinant attributes over time. The results show that our study can be used to identify determinant attributes of competing brands and can also be used to forecast consumer interest in these attributes.

abstract = {Segmenting industrial markets is a key challenge for the marketing field. More than 30 years of research has not produced comprehensive guidelines for developing robust B2B market segments; only a few studies have empirically tested the impact of segmentation and the literature today appears to be more fragmented than earlier. The present study integrates prior endeavors via a systematic literature review, scrutinizing 88 papers in detail. It develops a three-layer framework comprised of: (1) conceptualization of B2B market segmentation, (2) segmentation as a process, and (3) context. The authors use the framework to evaluate scholarly efforts during the 1986–2019 period and propose a broader view on segmentation as a continuous process. Marketers can benefit from the study by adopting four activities for segmenting markets: (1) pre-segmentation, (2) segmentation, (3) implementation, and (4) evaluation. Finally, the authors identify several gaps and offer a rigorous, practice-oriented research agenda, providing direction for academicians.}

Influencer marketing is on the rise, and many marketers now plan either to start using influencers or to increase their use of them in their media mixes. Despite such growth, relatively little strategic or academic insight exists that is specific to influencers. In this article, we describe the roots of influencer marketing and the many different types of influencers that now exist. We identify influencers’ three functional components: the audience, the endorser, and the social media manager. We then detail for each of these components the different sources of value influencers potentially offer marketers. We draw on relevant academic research to offer advice about how to leverage each component strategically. We close by describing how the interplay of these functional components makes influencers a potentially powerful—and undervalued—marketing tool.}

Using the trait-based concept of shopping orientation, we provide an additional antecedent to variety-seeking by looking at the phenomenon as it relates to the mindsets consumers adopt surrounding the process of shopping. Across three studies, we show that the more a consumer sees shopping as an enjoyable activity, the more likely they are to seek variety. We show this effect to occur regardless of whether choices are made sequentially, or as one bundle, as well as the roles that information-seeking and deal-proneness tendencies play. By providing this account of variety-seeking behavior we provide a significant addition to current knowledge as well as implications for firms seeking to manage the levels of variety sought by consumers.}

Within the overall conceptual focus of peace engineering, we analyze the operations and activities of six Turkish firms operating in the violence-hit and fragile countries of Congo, Ethiopia, Iraq, Morocco (the Western Sahara region), Somalia, and Sudan. The findings indicate that foreign firms operating in fragile and conflict-affected countries, along with achieving business goals, contribute significantly to the skills development of local employees and establish legitimacy through forging social connections and adopting corporate social responsibility activities. Their support for skills development resulted in career advancement opportunities and, in some cases, entrepreneurial ventures that were initiated by local employees. We argue that, despite precarious and unpredictable conditions, the operations of such firms can provide economic incentives as well as increased well-being and long-term stability in such contexts. Thus, the findings of this study have important implications for post-conflict recovery and local economic development through skills formation and entrepreneurial start-ups.}

It is a challenge that vexes many special interest operators, in particular, that are trying to carve out businesses in a micro and macro competitive environment that seems inimical to their success. They face the dual challenge of, at the micro level, trying to create awareness of their product offerings in a destination that does not see value in that type of product, and at the macro level, having to compete with similar products in other destinations where the destination image and product offerings are compatible. This paper discusses the dual nature of that challenge, by proposing two frameworks. The first presents a continuum of the relationship between destination image and tourism products, while the second presents a conceptual model outlining challenge facing products when non-alignment of destination image occurs.}

This in itself is surprising: this revolution implies a profound impact on the business models of companies and institutions as it pushes a new paradigm of sustainable development for healthcare and welfare systems at the global level. However, little is known about whether, to what extent, and in what direction these dynamics are impacting on the way organisations and value chains are managed, from research to care delivery. Our study addresses this gap: we discuss both theoretical arguments and empirical evidence from a multiple case study survey. Findings show that PM is a multi-faceted phenomenon grounded on novel forms of innovation eco-systems and bundled-based models.

Of many environmental variables, we focus mainly on the presence of other offers (online) and retailers (offline). We find that online and offline environmental factors have significant but different effects on the outcomes. Specifically, when more offers of the same kind are displayed in an online platform page, there are less sales and product discussion but more social referral. When a local retailer is in a region populated more by the same kind of service, sales and social interactions are both greater overall. The results suggest that these retailers should optimize their strategies according to their specific objectives when using such platforms.}

These constructs positively affect consumer intention to buy organic goods, which ultimately leads to their actual purchase. Hofstede’s cultural dimensions (i.e., individualism, masculinity, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, indulgence) were also found to play a pivotal role in moderating most causal relationships between constructs of the model. It was also revealed that studies focusing on organic food exhibited stronger effects on construct associations compared to studies examining non-food products.}

While AI climate refers to the shared perceptions of policies, procedures, and practices to support AI initiatives, cognitive service analytics capability refers to the analytical insights driven by AI climate and augmented by both machines and humans to make marketing decisions. However, there is limited knowledge on the antecedents of such analytics capabilities and their overall effects on service innovation and market performance. Drawing on service analytics literature and the microfoundations of dynamic capability theory, this study fills this research gap using in-depth interviews (n = 30) and a survey (n = 276) of service analytics managers within the AI climate in Australia. The findings confirm the five microfoundations of cognitive service analytics capabilities (cognitive technology, cognitive information, cognitive problem solving, cognitive knowledge & skills, cognitive training & development). The findings also highlight the significant mediating effect of service innovation in the relationship between analytics climate and market performance and cognitive service analytics capability and market performance.}

To address this issue, the authors use the concept of fit and propose a comprehensive conceptualization of the combination of competitor and alliance orientations; additionally, we empirically identify the combined effects of balance, alignment, and the interaction on product innovativeness. A causal-explanatory, cross-sectional, questionnaire-based design with purposive sampling was conducted. The empirical assessment used a sample of 139 senior managers in Taiwan's electronics industry (with a valid response rate of 16.85%). Research hypotheses were evaluated using partial least squares structural equation modeling, analysis of covariance, and quantile regression analyses. The results show that the relative imbalance between the competitor and alliance orientations is not significantly associated with product innovativeness. Aligning these two orientations significantly improves product innovativeness, which supports the matching perspective of coalignment. Furthermore, in relation to fit as moderation, the interaction between the two orientations is negatively related to product innovativeness. These results provide a new lens through which scholars can assess and measure the joint effects of competitor and alliance orientations and offer managerial guidance to practitioners.}

Existing works address the joint lot-sizing and pricing problem without backlogging, although it is a usual strategy that permits to satisfy customer demand with delay. In this work, we study a new multi-product joint lot-sizing and pricing problem with backlogging and limited production capacity. The objective is to maximize the total company profit over a finite planning horizon. For the problem, a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation is given. Then, several optimality properties are provided and a tighter MINLP model is established based on these properties. According to the NP-hard nature and non-linearity of the model, a model based heuristic that focuses on efficiently solving small-sized instances is proposed and a genetic algorithm (GA) with new progressive repair strategy is developed to address large-sized instances. Managerial insights are drawn based an illustrative example. Numerical experiments are conducted on 64 benchmark based instances and 105 randomly generated instances with up to 10 products and 12 periods, which validates the MINLP formulation and shows the efficiency of the proposed solution methods.}

To address this gap, this study employs a multiple case study approach to uncover the varied processes and outcomes of implementing digital diversification programs in established firms. The findings reveal that established firms frequently refine and adjust their digital diversification strategies to achieve desired results. Specifically, related digital diversification strategies benefit from well-defined market segments, clear technological focus, and robust senior management support. In contrast, unrelated digital diversification strategies thrive through extensive exploration and experimentation with novel digital technologies and markets, reduced senior managerial intervention and increased middle- and lower-level management involvement. Semi-related digital diversification strategies, which incorporate elements of both related and unrelated approaches, often encounter tensions owing to conflicting traditional and new program execution methods, posing significant realization challenges. Key factors identified as instrumental in the success of digital diversification strategies include technology, markets, management & organization, and program execution. The study concludes by discussing the managerial and academic implications and offers recommendations for future research in this domain.}

In this paper, we present an automated tool, called the Manufacturing Process Failure Diagnosis Tool (MPFDT) that can detect and isolate the faults and anomalies in the PLC controlled manufacturing systems effectively. MPFDT utilizes two independent knowledge-based process behaviour models of the manufacturing system to satisfy the FADI purpose. The fundamental idea is to detect the inconsistencies between the modelled and the observed manufacturing process behaviour. The first model is a Deterministic Finite-state Automaton (DFA) based model of the PLC control process that is used to determine whether the observed state transition behaviour of the PLC control process is consistent with the modelled state transition behaviour or not. The second model is basically a set of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based one-class classifiers that are used to identify whether any significant difference exist between the observed and the reference electrical power consumption profile of the manufacturing system or not. The experimental results show that the FADI accuracy rate of the proposed tool is very high (more than 98%).}

The potential to extract actionable insights from Big Data has gained increasing attention of both academics and practitioners operating in several industries.

Therefore, the gap existing between the potential of value creation embedded in the Big Data paradigm and the current limited exploitation of this value represents an area of investigation that this paper aims to explore. In particular, by following a systematic literature review, this study aims at presenting a framework that outlines the multiple value directions that the Big Data paradigm can generate for the adopting organizations. Eleven distinct value directions have been identified and then grouped in five dimensions (Informational, Transactional, Transformational, Strategic, Infrastructural Value), which constitute the pillars of the proposed framework. Finally, the framework has been also preliminarily applied in three case studies conducted within three Italian based companies operating in different industries (e-commerce, fast-moving consumer goods, and banking) in the final aim to see its applicability in real business scenarios.}

The current study provides insights into the relationship between experiential value (cognitive, hedonic, social, and ethical) and consumer engagement (cognitive processing, affection, and activation), resulting in brand relationship performance outcomes that in turn lead to value co-creation intentions. In addition, the role of self-brand connection as a moderator and consumer engagement as a mediator is also examined. A large-scale survey was conducted with 485 consumers who follow brand pages at a popular social networking site. The findings reveal that experiential value has a positive impact on consumer engagement, while consumer engagement is positively associated with brand loyalty and satisfaction, which in turn leads to value co-creation.

Results from an event study of SBDTC channel additions in the cable television industry show that they complicate channel relationships and can lead to conflict, which reduce firm value. Further analysis reveals that firm-specific characteristics and strategic execution factors operate to mitigate the loss in firm value. Specifically, the study results show that channel power diminishes the negative impact of channel conflict, suggesting that firms with greater channel power benefit from adding SBDTC channels.

However, by integrating the attention-based view, we raise a question as to why VRIN-O resources alone are not sufficient for sustainable performance. We introduce the variable - decision-makers’ attention- as a key moderator in achieving sustainable performance so that VRIN-O/capability and capability/resource heterogeneity may last longer. To test this relationship, we examine how the needs of firms to balance their exploration and exploitation efforts, called relative exploration anchored to resource-based theory is influenced by CEO’s attention towards entrepreneurial orientation and market orientation as moderators. Using a panel data set of 269 firms listed on the Nordic NASDAQ stock exchange, we find an inverted U-shaped relationship between relative exploration and long-term performance, while the attentions of the CEO have a positive moderation effect. Thus, using the attention-based view complements the resource-based theory in explaining sustainable competitive advantage especially in the dynamic environment.}

Place websites have surprisingly not adequately featured in academic and practitioner interrogation with respect to brand marketing and communications and this paper is one of the attempts to address this research lacuna. Significant implications for researchers and managers promoting destinations have been highlighted.}

This paper explores how emergent, incremental activities might unintentionally prompt market innovation due to the interactions of capability development and its required institutional work. Using a critical case method, we study a firm that successfully challenged established market logic by systematically changing its capabilities. A longitudinal field study reveals that capability development demands induce changes to institutional foundations; then, as institutions change, further capabilities can be developed, all of which may instigate wider market innovation outcomes. This study conceptualizes this intricate, iterative process, as well as its evolutionary market innovation outcomes. The proposed three-level capability model can guide firms striving to offer new and innovative services. The authors also detail a three-stage research design methodology that can help research and practice gain in-depth understanding of both emergent unintentional market innovation and strategic deliberate market-shaping activities.}

Marked by intense workloads, unmet expectations, and uncertainties around degree completion and employment, the higher education sector faces a growing challenge in maintaining and enhancing SWB. Current instruments for assessing SWB are limited in scope, failing to capture its multifaceted nature comprehensively. Addressing this gap, our research adopts a rigorous multi-study, multi-method, and multi-sample approach to develop and validate a multi-dimensional scale that effectively captures the nuances of SWB. This process encompassed five methodical stages: scale generation, scale purification, scale refinement, scale validation, and scale generalizability. The resulting SWB scale, encompassing five key dimensions—academic well-being, financial well-being, physical well-being, psychological resilience well-being, and relational well-being—provides a sophisticated tool for measuring and improving SWB in higher education contexts. Crucially, this paper extends beyond the scale development to explore the profound implications of this research for management education. By integrating SWB into management curricula and institutional cultures, this study underscores the potential for higher education to significantly contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being. It highlights how nurturing SWB in management education can foster more resilient, empathetic, and socially responsible future leaders, addressing a critical need in contemporary business environments and society at large.}

Furthermore, we find that knowledge exchange and knowledge integration mediate the relationship between interpersonal ties and innovation. Specifically, knowledge exchange mediates the relationship between operating-level interpersonal ties and exploitative innovation, whereas knowledge integration mediates the relationship between top-level/operating-level interpersonal ties and exploratory innovation.}

It also offers theoretically supported and validated scales to measure them. The authors empirically investigate their performance effects using different kinds of data pertaining to consumer brands, gathered from manager surveys, brands’ financial statements, Facebook fans, Instagram followers, YouTube subscribers, and brand image measures. The proposed social media resources and capabilities improve social media performance directly and brand perception indirectly. In particular, the impact of the social media strategy and measurement is moderated by firm size. A profile deviation analysis further reveals that the social media capabilities gap between top-performing versus other brands explains significant variance in social media performance. The advantages of developing social media capabilities early on also persist in the long-term, with substantial relevance for managers.}

abstract = {Matrimonial applications have become an indispensable component of the matrimonial landscape in India, facilitating individuals to expand their search for possible matches and make well-informed choices on their life mates. The emergence of marital apps can be traced back to approximately ten years ago. However, there exists a significant level of uncertainty and mixed feelings regarding the acceptance and utilisation of these apps. Previous research has predominantly concentrated on interconnected domains such as online dating, social networking, and the influence of technology on relationships. However, there exists a noticeable dearth of extensive scholarly investigations that exclusively centre on marital applications. Expanding upon the theoretical framework of the Uses and Gratification theory, researchers did a longitudinal analysis over three distinct time periods, with a total of 477, 456, and 429 participants. The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors that influence purchase motivation, adoption suggestion, and user happiness within the context of marital applications. The results obtained from the structural equation modelling indicate that convenience gratification, information gratification, and personal-identity gratification are significant predictors of the purchase motive for marital applications. Furthermore, the findings from the first wave of data analysis provide confirmation of the influential role played by community orientation inside these applications. The results of the second wave of data analysis provide confirmation of the influential role played by the moderators, innovativeness and privacy concerns in enhancing consumers' intention to adopt and advocate a certain product or service. Ultimately, the results of wave 3 validate the significance of moderating variable, user experience, in augmenting user pleasure with these applications. The study elaborates that managers must acknowledge the changing dynamics in society norms and desires, as the younger generation progressively adopts technology to seek romantic partners. Furthermore, it is crucial to have efficient marketing techniques that align with the cultural intricacies of various communities in India. This study contributes to the comprehensive comprehension of consumer behaviour within the context of marital applications, providing exciting theoretical and managerial implications for the adoption and deployment of these technologies.}

(2018) time-varying causality and Breitung and Candelon (2006) frequency domain Granger-causality approaches. Hedge ratio results show that GO-GARCH has the highest hedging effectiveness for hedging green bonds with shale gas and natural gas. Natural gas appears to be the best hedge for green bond prices, according to estimates of hedging effectiveness. We find no significant Granger causality between green bonds and natural gas in the short- and long-term dynamics of the spectral Granger causality test, but we do find long-term Granger causality between green bonds and shale gas. We find strong significant bidirectional causal effects between green bonds and gas prices during bearish market conditions using the time-varying causality test. The evidence of a strong correlation between green bonds and shale gas and natural gas suggests that policymakers should consider both markets as interconnected in their policy formulation strategy. Furthermore, increasing the share of green bonds will undeniably support the transition to a low-carbon economy, fulfilling the promise of the Paris climate change agreement. Realizing the role of green bonds as diversifiers against the fluctuation of gas markets encourages portfolio investors who want to achieve higher investment performance to include green bonds in their portfolios.}

Consumer-level analysis reveals a U-shaped relationship between family income and prestige sensitivity, emphasizing heightened sensitivity among lower and higher-end middle-income consumers. Top-tier luxury watch brands demonstrate a more pronounced prestige effect compared to lower-tier counterparts at the brand level. What-if simulations underscore the advantages of brand promotion and enhanced prestige, especially for top-tier brands. Income escalation benefits top-tier luxury watch brands, while its impact on lower-tier brands is intricate. These findings offer strategic insights for marketers to refine their approaches and harness the power of the prestige effect.}

SMO is modelled as a three-dimensional formative construct comprising strategic integration, societal engagement, and ethical capabilities. In addition, in this study, we expand knowledge by extending the SMO literature and building ties between the theory of planned behaviour and sustainable marketing theoretical perspectives, by integrating attitudes, subjective norms, behavioural control of managers, and implementation of SMO in a single model. With the analysis of structural equation modelling, we confirmed the three-dimensional SMO and its contribution to start-ups' profitability. Moreover, we proved that attitudes are marginal, whereas subjective norm and perceived behavioural control are a very strong predictor of SMO. Finally, by using the cluster analysis, we revealed that B2B start-ups have lower levels of strategic integration, societal engagement, and ethical capabilities, as opposed to B2C start-ups.}

Base classifiers suitable for each test telemarketing campaign are integrated according to the dynamic-based base classifiers integration method. Experimental results on bank telemarketing data show that META-DES-AAP achieves the best accuracy and the largest average profit when compared across several state-of-the-art machine learning methods. In addition, the factors influencing telemarketing on the average predicted probability of telemarketing success and average profit obtained by META-DES-AAP are analyzed.}

Using a dataset of 24,011 IJVs in 48 countries between 1995 and 2017, we examine the impact of partners’ home countries, the IJV host country, and their interactions on the likelihood of IJV termination. Our findings reveal that beyond the frequently examined partner-, IJV-, and host country-related factors in prior research, the context of IJV partners’ home countries, the IJV host country, and their interactions significantly matter for IJV termination.}

Data is analysed using thematic analysis, and findings reveal three transcultural identity patterns: accommodating, re-acculturating, and resisting Sikh culture. We argue that the emergent identity patterns are fluid, as our participants feel neither wholly British, wholly Sikh, nor wholly British-Sikh, positioning themselves beyond, rather than against, Sikh or British culture. We uncover the connectedness between the traditional cultural practices of arranged marriages and the space of shaadi.com, a matrimonial website. We interpret this website as a medium through which transcultural identities are constructed. We contribute to theory by showing the development of transcultural patterns of consumption and consistent transcultural identity construction in non-migrating ethnic communities.}

To date, embedding a sustainability dimension into supply chain management remains a challenge for organizations given the lack of systematic knowledge of the key dimensions of GSCM practices, the factors that influence the implementation of GSCM practices, and the benefits that organizations gain through the implementation of such practices. To address this problem, this study reviews 151 research articles published between 1997 and 2021 in the GSCM literature, and offers a theoretical framework that synthesizes and integrates the knowledge acquired from the reviewed literature. This framework includes various dimensions of GSCM practices identified in the past research studies, the antecedents that influence implementation of GSCM practices, and the outcomes of implementation of such practices. Further, this study offers theoretical and practical perspectives to support future research utilizing a research model as a baseline to guide organizations in the understanding of the primary GSCM attributes, their predictors, and benefits.}

The result shows a negative dependence structure for the return series between AI and carbon prices. However, the relationship is asymmetric, indicating that there is a stronger tail dependence in the lower tails instead of the upper tails. The finding implies that AI is a favourable hedge against carbon prices, therefore indicating the diversification benefits of AI. To understand the issue in detail, we examine the effect of economic policy uncertainty, equity market volatility, and the recent COVID-19 pandemic; we find their negative effect on the dynamic dependence structure between AI and carbon prices at lower and higher quantiles. This evidence offers additional support for the safe-haven ability of AI for carbon prices.}

abstract = {CSR’s beneficial roles on firm financial performance have been well documented. However, the relationships existing in the literature are largely assumed to be linear. In this research, we propose a U-shaped relationship between CSR and firm cash flow volatility to demonstrate CSR’s dynamic implication on the performance instability and therefore extend the understanding of CSR into a new area involving firm performance risk factors. Further, we incorporate another key firm characteristic, marketing capability, to formulate the interactive associations between CSR and firm market-side ability toward better risk management. The results show that CSR may reduce firm cash flow volatility at low and moderate levels but will increase the volatility when the engagement is high. However, a firm with high marketing capability will eliminate the negative impact of CSR.}

The potential to extract actionable insights from Big Data has gained increasing attention of both academics and practitioners operating in several industries. Marketing domain has become from the start a field for experiments with Big Data approaches, even if the adoption of Big Data solutions does not always generate effective value for the adopters. Therefore, the gap existing between the potential of value creation embedded in the Big Data paradigm and the current limited exploitation of this value represents an area of investigation that this paper aims to explore. In particular, by following a systematic literature review, this study aims at presenting a framework that outlines the multiple value directions that the Big Data paradigm can generate for the adopting organizations. Eleven distinct value directions have been identified and then grouped in five dimensions (Informational, Transactional, Transformational, Strategic, Infrastructural Value), which constitute the pillars of the proposed framework. Finally, the framework has been also preliminarily applied in three case studies conducted within three Italian based companies operating in different industries (e-commerce, fast-moving consumer goods, and banking) in the final aim to see its applicability in real business scenarios.}

While the causalities underlying this relationship are not conclusively established, researchers broadly agree that higher educational attainment leads to higher income levels in dependent employment, temporary hiring, and freelancing alike. The ‘gig economy’, where workers complete jobs mediated by online platforms, challenges this paradigm as gig workers can access jobs without any educational certificates. Building a theoretical framework based on agency-driven accounts, we investigate whether we can empirically observe a relationship between educational attainment and wage levels in the gig economy. Our OLS regression analyses of 1607 gig workers in 14 Western economies illustrate no statistically significant correlation. Instead, the platform's review system as well as the gig workers' level of previous job experience serve as the major signalling mechanisms that help to reduce information asymmetry. Qualitative insights gained from in-depth interviews explain this finding by revealing how gig workers gain the necessary qualifications for their jobs, most importantly, through self-study, learning-by-doing, and trial-and-error processes. Our findings therefore point out that advanced educational credentials are only of limited use for gig workers.}

The motivation of seeking redress together with assertiveness and high dissatisfaction, play an essential role in the choice of complaint channel.

This paper explores the tensions that industrial firms encounter when attempting to integrate services and solutions into their offerings. Following an exploratory multiple case study approach, we identify several tensions experienced at the intra- and interorganizational levels by three industrial firms. By drawing on the four flows model—activity coordination, organizational self-structuring, institutional positioning, and membership negotiation—we identify tensions at the intersection of the flows. The findings elucidate how many of the identified tensions become knotted and movement across organizational levels is created through communicative processes. We make contributions to the literature by drawing on communicative processes to explain how paradoxical tensions emerge within a servitization context and become entangled. As servitizing firms move toward offering advanced services, they are likely to face an increasing number of tensions spanning intra- and interorganizational levels. Our study raises important implications as inextricable entanglements between tensions creates complexity, which requires managers to focus more clearly on the challenge of coping with these on an ongoing basis.}

We collected data from 550 users of delivery robots. Our structural equation modelling results show that two hedonic- (i.e., gratification and anthropomorphism) and three utilitarian- (i.e., service quality experience, delivery task requirements, and user-facing technology performance) driven factors predict perceived TTF in using delivery robots. Value-in-use and trust have sequential mediating effects that connect perceived TTF and service reuse likelihood and word-of-mouth recommendation.

In this paper, we take a step back to better understand the state of LO research, including its relationship with strategic orientations. As a part of this synthesis, we offer several criticisms of the LO literature that hinders its conceptual development as an initiator of capability enhancement, innovation, and performance. A key assertion is that LO is not a strategic orientation per se because it influences the quality of informational inputs into strategic planning, not their focus. That is, LO does not direct firms towards a particular strategic approach as do strategic orientations. Instead, as a dynamic capability it motivates firms to monitor and improve the quality of information used to operationalize all strategic orientations. As such, it improves the efficacy of whichever strategic orientation(s) firms choose to adopt.}

Of all the drivers of social change, alterations in food security status are one of the most disruptive to societies. Improvements can release individuals and groups from chronic hunger, malnourishment, anxieties stemming from continually having to search for the next meal and obtaining food being a full time occupation. Deterioration can lead to declining productivity, mass migrations, famine and death – all of which can spark social change. Forecasting changes in food security is, hence, important for policy makers. Improving food security requires increases in agricultural productivity. New plant breeding technologies based on genomics do not rely on controversial transgenic technology. It is important to understand the link between regulatory policy and firm's decisions to invest in the development of new crop varieties. By making the link between regulation and investment explicit suggests that the regulatory regime chosen for technological advance in genomics and associated enabling techniques should be considered carefully in the context of the need for investments in productivity enhancing technology and for forecasting food security challenges.}

The study investigated ten factors by collecting data through a field survey (questionnaire) from 362 participants. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was applied, showing that all ten factors were responsible for positive intention towards the latest Android versions. Path analysis results showed that performance expectancy, compatibility, price value, effort expectancy, and observability have a crucial role in consumers' intention to adopt upgraded (latest) versions of Android smartphones.}

We do so through a case study, namely Le Petit Chef AR dining experience. Our findings suggest that AR can influence positively or negatively consumers’ perceptions of their restaurant experiences according to five dimensions, namely sensory dimensions (the five senses’ intensity), the affective dimension (pleasantness), and behavioral, social, and intellectual dimensions. These dimensions can improve the customer's experience and be managed by restaurateurs to enhance positive attitudes toward AR in the restaurant industry. Furthermore, the results revealed that AR plays an essential role in terms of improving the overall food well-being of consumers and thus can lead to positive post-consumption behaviors.

A top-down approach is adopted to construct a financial proxy-based sentiment index completed with sentiment extracted from automobile news and customer reviews. The paper uses a text mining approach to holistically measure customer sentiment's impact on investor sentiment and stock prices. The study was initially performed at the overall individual stock from the Nifty Auto NSE but focused on the top three passenger vehicle manufacturing companies i.e., Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, and Eicher. It was found that the sentiment index was augmented with news and customer reviews allows predicting more accurately NIFTY AUTO stock price movements. This implies that customer sentiment is a major driver of investor sentiment which in turn impacts the stock market and the firm value. Thus, the present study is an integrated approach to holistically measure customer sentiment's impact on investor sentiment and stock prices.}

The findings show that for utilitarian-type customers in a high-involvement AI purchase condition, music-recognition biometric-induced emotion mediates cognition and behavioral intentions. Both likability and the tempo of the music affect the impact of music on cognition. This study contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between cognition and emotion induced by AI-based facial and music biometric systems in shaping customer behavior and it adds to the atmospheric literature.

First, Study 1 utilizes qualitative interviews with actual campaign participants to provide initial insights to develop our theoretical model, which we subsequently test in two experiments. Study 2 finds that brand loyalty is a key driver of consumer activism, with both direct and indirect effects through its impact on issue salience, information seeking behavior, and its interaction with the issue type. Finally, Study 3 finds that consumer activism is associated with increased brand loyalty, indicating that this may be a relationship building activity and an important dimension of the longer process of social exchange between the brand and consumer.}

Per findings of two studies performed under the given economically intense conditions, it is evidenced that the right answer to survival rests upon: (a) the entrepreneurs' personality traits and skills that affect the market and entrepreneurial orientations of SMEs, (b) the adoption of such orientations that keep impacting the firms' performance, and finally (c) the implementation of strategy relevant to reaching higher quality standards for products and services, combined with tactics relevant to downsizing, marketing actions, extroversion, and financial management.}

We focus on technical services that have received limited scholarly attention. We theorize that innovative born global firms build a set of capabilities in market, internal and relational learning that will provide new knowledge configurations to undertake technical and administrative innovations. Adopting an organizational sub-system view, we posit that market learning drives other learning capabilities in the firm to contribute collectively to innovation, and in turn, international market outcomes. The findings of our study of US born global SMEs support this theorization. Market-learning capability operates in a complex set of relationships with other learning capabilities in its contribution to innovation. Interestingly, relative to technical innovation, administrative innovation makes a prominent contribution to international market outcomes. We discuss implications of our findings for theory and practice and provide future research directions.}

Using advanced PLS-SEM techniques, this research introduces a third order reflective-formative hierarchical component model (HCM) into the retailer brand equity domain. The research validates an IRBE model with four consumer dimensions and seven employee dimensions. Both types of employees value all four consumer dimensions; however, they value different employee dimensions. The IRBE model, when operationalized, can encourage closer integration of human resources and marketing functions, and enable practitioners to enhance their brand offerings and build a more cohesive retailer brand.}

Findings indicate that the needs and perspective of the BoP members is distinct from the Middle of the Pyramid (MoP). Managers should consider this point while formulating marketing mix strategies for BoP markets. The present study is the first of its kind to present a revised marketing mix framework for customers in the BoP markets.

We show the potential of using consumer clickstream data, an important type of big data, to create a new set of B2B analytical frameworks. In the markets where complex interactions between competitors, search intermediaries and consumers create a network, B2B relationships can be inferred from consumer search patterns, and can then be modeled to gauge the online performance. A commercial dataset from ComScore’s US panel of one million users is used to illustrate a new approach to measure and evaluate the online performance of competitors in the US airline market. The methodology and associated performance framework demonstrate the potential for new forms of market intelligence based on the visualization of market networks, online performance calculated from matrix algorithms, the measurement of the impact of search intermediaries, and the identification of latent relationships. This research makes theoretical and empirical contributions to the debate on the use of big data for B2B market analytics. B2B managers can use this approach to extend their network horizon from an egocentric to a network view of competition and map out their competitive landscape from the perspective of the customer.}

Using the framework, the study establishes a theoretical link between behavioral reasoning theory (BRT) and marketing accountability theory (MAT). Data was collected from 254 B2B SME marketers in India through a structured questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews. At first glance, the missing link between SME performance and SNMM appears to be time, knowledge, and financial resources. SMEs that embrace innovation, proactiveness, and risk-taking can benefit from social media technologies. Thus, social networking has a direct, positive effect on SME growth. The implications for B2B SMEs’ SNMM studies are also discussed. Furthermore, the rationality of B2B marketing metrics has a tremendous influence on business success. Although the study has found a positive impact of SNMM on B2B SMEs success, further research is needed.}

For this purpose, participatory culture is first proposed as an alternative conceptual framework, followed by empirical research, which upgrades visual content analysis (VCA) with semiotic analysis. The findings of VCA reveal that memes yield a markedly different representation of Thailand as they introduce an entire cluster of peculiar and controversial themes, which are not depicted on destination marketing organization (DMO) and TripAdvisor photos. Semiotic analysis, in addition, uncovers that memetic representation is evocative and conveys a layer of symbolic notions and alluding connotations. In this manner, findings attest that memes are a semantically rich format and genre of UGC, which expands existing knowledge about destination-image formation and representation on social media. Managerial implications, limitations, and recommendations for future research in this domain are also discussed.}

Hierarchical regression analyses are conducted to test the research model based on the data collected from 270 manufacturing firms in China. The results suggest that knowledge breadth and depth affect knowledge sharing intention in opposite directions. Specifically, firms with a broad knowledge base are more likely to share their knowledge in interfirm cooperation, whereas firms with deep knowledge are reluctant to share. More importantly, the empirical results suggest that both strategic consensus and bilateral specific asset investments positively moderate the relationships between knowledge structure attributes and knowledge sharing intention, implying that both mechanisms can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of knowledge sharing and consequently, affect senders’ intention to share their knowledge.}

Based on a seven-wave longitudinal study, we developed a dynamic model to capture the mediation effect of TMS and the temporal effect of shared leadership and TMS on future team performance. With observations on the full life cycle of the teams participating in the project, we found that shared leadership had a positive effect on team performance and that TMS mediated this positive relationship. In addition, we found that the effect of shared leadership on team performance was stronger during the early stages of the team life cycle, and again TMS mediated this conditional effect.}

Irrespective of consumers’ need for uniqueness being considered as an important psychological factor impacting luxury consumption intention, research seldom investigates the impact of CNFU dimensions on luxury consumption. This study investigates how CNFU dimensions (i.e. creative choice counter-conformity, unpopular choice counter-conformity and avoidance of similarity) drive luxury consumption intention in light of the mediating role of social comparison and the moderating role of materialism. Four hundred twenty-eight surveys completed by high-income consumers in India were used for analysis. The findings showed that social comparison mediates the effects of creative choice counter conformity and avoidance of similarity on luxury consumption. Materialism moderates these mediation effects. This study contributes to the luxury consumption literature by explaining how the interplay of psychological and social factor affects luxury purchase intention among the people driven by different uniqueness dimensions. Practically, the findings will be useful to the retailers and marketers of fashion luxury items and brands.}

Data were collected from 432 online apparel consumers using a survey questionnaire. First, the instrument's psychometric properties were checked, and then data was analyzed using Hayes's PROCESS macros. The results indicate that online purchase intention mediates the relationship between consumers' attitudes toward online shopping and actual purchase behavior. In addition, the results found strong support for the three-way interactions between attitude, perceived risk, and EWOM on purchase intention, and (ii) attitude, EWOM, and perceived behavioral control on actual purchase behavior mediated through purchase intention. The three-way interactions involving the double-moderation of EWOM make significant contributions to the growing literature on online buying.}

The differences manifested themselves in the form of different views concerning material well-being, house ownership, freedom, teamwork, and the general approach to working life (being a co-owner and being an employee). At the same time, we found that issues like job security, temporary contracts, part-time work, and gig working needed to be seen more in-depth instead of assuming their generic negative influence on well-being and work meaningfulness. Finally, the findings reveal that change is the name of the game for many millennial and post-millennial high-tech workers, and they may not necessarily associate these aspects negatively with work meaningfulness.}

The results provide support for the interactions between regulatory focus and attribute framing for shampoo, and between regulatory focus and brand types for shoes. When exposed to shampoo ads, promotion focused consumers have a more positive attitude toward the ad and a higher purchase intention if the ad features utilitarian rather than hedonic attributes. Further, both promotion and prevention focused consumers prefer national brands of shoes to private labels. One possible explanation may lie in private versus public consumption of shampoo and shoes.}

The current study addresses this gap by examining how various acculturation patterns (i.e., integration, assimilation, separation, and marginalization) assess the mass-prestige quotient of fashion accessory brands (sunglasses). The study identifies RayBan as a masstige brand in the sunglasses category and observes that the assimilation acculturation group assigned RayBan the highest masstige score, followed by the integration, marginalization, and separation groups. Furthermore, cultural worldview is identified as the underlying mechanism for differences in the masstige scores across various acculturation groups. By explaining the cultural consequences of masstige-based brand consumption, this study contributes to the growing masstige academic literature.}

Useable responses collected from 427 high-income Indian luxury fashion consumers were analysed using SEM and Process-Macro. The creative choice dimension enhances the purchase intention of bandwagon luxury items indirectly via social comparison while psychological entitlement strengthens this indirect effect. The unpopular choice tendency has significant direct effect on snob luxury consumption. The avoidance of similarity dimension enhances purchase intention of snob luxury items directly while it also enhances bandwagon luxury consumption indirectly via social comparison. Psychological entitlement strengthens this indirect effect. This study contributes to the luxury consumption literature by proposing three distinctive types of consumption behaviours relating to snob and bandwagon luxury items based on these interplays.}

We shed light on the microfoundational processes of collaborative networks and their impact on investment risk assessment by exploring IA performance measures in response to decomposing macro-level constructs. The IA measures focus on the exploration of individual human capital and their actions and interactions that influence investment risk assessments, which is critical for long-term prosperity. Additionally, human capital herein includes social factors such as social capital, which research has demonstrated can be developed from intellectual capital, and vice versa. Findings from an experiment with 40 professional investors (resulting in 160 independent observations) suggested that belonging to a company's collaborative networks—where they would gain access to IA performance information—led them to adjust their investment risk assessments downward or upward in response to material weakness or strength disclosures pertaining to IA performance. Additionally, a laboratory experiment revealed that 121 novice investors who learned how to interpret and use their social networks to gain access to IA performance information also led them to adjust their investment risk assessments in response to material IA information deficiencies in target companies. The results showed IA knowledge can be learned and transferred to impact social change.}

Significant steps have been initiated to control the escalating emissions, climate change, and global warming. Recently, an international contract was signed in Paris targeting net zero emissions by 2050. This study was conducted to positively support the cause and assist in its progress. This study identifies some of the critical factors hindering the progress of net-zero emission (NZE)-supporting technologies and methods within firms in various sectors. For a broader understanding of these factors, they were sorted according to suitable criteria. A novel methodological approach of PF-Delphi-AHP-CoCoSo and sensitivity analysis was utilized to draw results regarding the priority of consideration for the critical factors relating to the importance of their criteria. A questionnaire was prepared, and a panel of experts was consulted for their opinions, according to which the analysis was conducted. The results show that managerial issues and a lack of professional expertise have the highest importance, meaning that these are the key fields where attention is needed to implement the NZE agenda.}

This generative user innovation necessitates new theorization to better understand the interplay between characteristics of the source innovation and the community's collective motivation. Motivation is a heightened concern in online communities where contributors often select which problems warrant their effort. Two studies improve our understanding of how the community's motivations compel remixing and impact two aspects of the depth of these remixes (improvement and differentness). First, hypotheses regarding the community's collective remix response are developed and tested. After this, an exploratory (fsQCA) study seeks out configurations of these motivations that consistently result in improved and different remixes. Using data from thingiverse.com, we show that established motivations for user innovation (enjoyment, learning, use-value) motivate remixing, but learning and use-value's effects are moderated by source innovation quality. Learning and use-value are only impactful for high quality source objects. We also demonstrate that originality of the source object has an inverted-U relationship with remixing; innovations need to be novel, but not drastically different from expectations to generate a remix response from the community.}

By examining 230 Australasian firms exporting to Greater China region, we found out that customer relationships have a significant effect on export performance while supplier relationships do not have such effect. To better understand development of B2B relationships, we examined the role of immigrant manager in building of such relationships to confirm that the interaction of customer relationships and immigrant manager has a positive impact on export performance whereas the interaction of supplier relationships and immigrant manager does not have a positive effect on performance. We also included PCD into the conceptual model to explore its influence on the interaction between customer and supplier relationships and immigrant manager and how it affects the export performance. This inclusion demonstrated the importance of immigrant manager in developing customer relationships when PCD is high, however the interaction between supplier relationships, PCD and immigrant manager does not have any significant effect. The results of our study therefore have important implications of when and how immigrant managers can be employed to positively influence development of B2B relationships and improve export performance. This study also makes a significant theoretical contribution to B2B relationships and export performance literature by closing gaps in understanding of the role of PCD and immigrant manager in building of efficient inter-cultural B2B relationships and making a distinction between B2B relationships customer and supplier effects.}

Choosing the right method as one of the steps in the technology transfer (TT) process has a significant impact on the successful implementation of technology acquisition (TA). The purpose of this study is to select the most appropriate method of acquiring interactive TV technology for MTN Irancell Telecommunication Company using a combined model of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. Therefore, in this research, in the first stage of structuring, the list of criteria and alternatives was determined based on a literature review. Then, in the assessment phase, the fuzzy Delphi technique was used to finalize the list of criteria and alternatives, and then an improved fuzzy group hierarchical best-worst method (fuzzy G-HBWM) was used to determine the criteria weights and evaluate the alternatives by an expert group to form a decision matrix. Finally, in the ranking stage, the alternatives were ranked using fuzzy multi-attribute decision-making (F-MADM) methods including ARAS-F, fuzzy TOPSIS, fuzzy WASPAS, fuzzy VIKOR, fuzzy MABAC, and fuzzy SAW. Then, the Integer Linear Program (ILP) model was used to aggregate the ranking. Based on the results, the main criteria in order of importance are: technology factors, environmental and market factors, organizational factors, and partner or vendor factors. Also, the most important sub-criteria can be considered, respectively, as: the innovative rate in the industry, the degree of strategic importance of technology, the need for access to technology, and the ability to share assets. The final ranking results showed that turnkey contracts, stock ownership, and outsourcing are the top three alternatives in order of priority.}

Existing research suggests that most marketing strategies suffer due to poor implementation; however, the nuances of strategy implementation impediments and their accompanying remedies remain underdeveloped. To contribute to this line of inquiry, the authors use multi-level qualitative data to capture cross-functional dynamics that traverse the organizational hierarchy and are critical to marketing strategy implementation. The data collection procedure consisted of depth interviews with 48 informants within eight organizations, constituting sales-marketing dyads at three hierarchical levels (senior, middle, and frontline) within each organization. Findings suggest that sales and marketing personnel’s varying self-interests at different hierarchical levels motivate them to engage in a distinct set of inter- and intra-functional activities that foment implementation impediments. In turn, findings explicate not only the individual effects of these impediments but also their cumulative between-level (trickle-down) and within-level, within-function (trickle-around) impact as the strategy moves through the hierarchy of the sales-marketing interface. The authors then offer prescriptive remedies embedded in the informal organization that may stabilize the implementation process. Viewed holistically, this study contributes to marketing literature by inductively deriving a theory of marketing strategy implementation within the sales-marketing interface.}

However, little research has focused on what factors influence incubator size. We theorize and show partial support for size benefits to incubator specialization. Analyses of the relationship between size and four distinct specialization strategies in a sample of 96 European incubators show that incubator size is positively related to a strategic focus on universities and research institutes as recruitment channels and to a focus on sustainability, but unrelated to industry focus. Incubator size was found to be negatively related to a regional focus. While sustainability focused incubators tended to not find recruitment challenging, paradoxically, among those who did, the most frequently reported challenges were related to finding tenants that focus on sustainability. Post-hoc analyses revealed that tenants with a focus other than sustainability often dominate sustainability-oriented incubators, suggesting that sustainability may be more of a legitimating strategy than an explicit selection criterion.}

abstract = {Supply chain resilience (SCRES) is an emerging research area, which plays a crucial role in protecting supply chains (SCs) against small- to large-scale disruptions. Over the past few years, many researchers have focused on developing SCRES strategies that have significantly contributed to mitigating SC disruptions. While the number of papers on this subject has been gradually increasing, the absence of a systematic literature review means that it is unclear which SCRES strategies for mitigating SC disruptions have already been studied and which issues still need to be investigated. Therefore, there is a need to conduct a systematic literature review to provide a comprehensive overview of SC resilience initiatives and strategies. For the review and synthesis conducted in this paper, 151 relevant articles were identified through a systematic search and selection of papers published between 2010 and 2021. First, the main themes of the SCRES strategies were categorized. The development of SCRES strategies for preparedness, response, and recovery, aimed at mitigating SC disruptions, was reviewed. Second, a detailed analysis of research developments in SCRES strategies was conducted, along with an investigation into the methodological, theoretical, and contextual justifications for tackling SC disruptions. Third, literature on SCRES strategies was synthesized for mapping and identifying potential research gaps. The analysis revealed that there is a scarcity of simulation model-based and theoretically grounded studies to mitigate large-scale SC disruptions. Moreover, it was also found that most studies have identified SCRES strategies for low-demand luxury products, while high-demand essential products and services have largely been ignored. Finally, based on the analysis, this article identifies research questions and future research directions for the field of SCRES research. These can guide academics and practitioners in designing and leading effective research in the field.}
