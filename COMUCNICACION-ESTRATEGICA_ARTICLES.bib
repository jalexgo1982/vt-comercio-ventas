abstract = {We identified a lack of theoretical concepts and empirical knowledge about the perception and usage of social bots from the organizational and communication management perspective. Therefore, we first introduce social bots in the realm of communication and information management by using a profound literature review. Second, by building on mediatization theory and strategic communication, we introduce the concept of deep strategic mediatization. By surveying the attitudes towards and usage of social bots of leading European communication professionals (n = 2,247) from 49 European countries, we thirdly offer first indications how diverse European organizations in different European regions use social bots. Results indicate, that leading communication professionals in Central and Western Europe as well as Scandinavia perceive highly ethical challenges, while in Southern and Eastern Europe professionals are less skeptical regarding the usage of social bots. Only 11.5 percent (n = 257) declare their organization uses or are making plans to use social bots for strategic communication. They are used primarily for identifying and following social networks users. This refers specifically to the usage of digital traces for strategic communication purposes e.g., to identify topic area opinion leaders or social media influencers. However, this represents only a small minority of the sample – leading to the conclusion that only a small minority of organizations already practice deep strategic mediatization.}

Public relations scholars have examined the applicability of public relations theories with religious organizations, and sought to develop new public relations theories, concepts, and models that are appropriate for the context of faith and religion. However, one set of public relations concepts has been limitedly studied, irregularly applied, and inconsistently explained regarding their definitions, how they work together, how they are distinct, and how they can be studied within and outside the narrow context of religious public relations. This conceptual framework essay explicates four constructs found in religious public relations scholarship to provide clarification regarding the application of these murky concepts and a roadmap for how public relations scholars can apply, study, and advance these concepts and models within and outside the context of religious public relations to advance public relations theorizing.}

In order to understand whether the PR profession is undergoing a major or just a minor change, this study focuses on expert attitudes toward the disruptions and the perceived change of their identity, strategy, and structure of PR. The analysis of semi-structured in-depth interviews yielded six themes: changes that are shaping the industry, changes in organizational identity, occupational definitions and roles, structural aspects, the difference between PR communication strategy and digital PR-strategy, new methods, tools, and measurement models and finally predictions for the future. Three main conclusions arise from these themes: PR agency self-identity is in a process of change from media-relations to strategic consultants; the main source of the change is perceived as media disruption rather than digital disruption (although they are interrelated); and the future in PR is predicted as the all-in-one marketing communications agency, which might develop into a new, hybrid, profession.}

abstract = {Distributors' opportunistic behaviors damage the manufacturer–distributor relationships and harm the manufacturer's performance. Thus, manufacturers must curb distributors' opportunism. Influence strategies, categorized as coercive and non-coercive, affect channel members' opportunism. Although previous studies identify the boundary conditions of coercive and non-coercive influence strategies, they focus on channel relationship characteristics as boundary conditions, ignoring channel structure, such as dual distribution channels. Accordingly, we examine whether dual channel system (vs. independent channel system) moderates the relationship between coercive/non-coercive influence strategies and distributor opportunism. Moreover, we investigate whether distributor dependence enhances the dual-channel moderating role. To test our hypotheses, primary data were collected from Japanese CEOs engaged in distribution firms. The results indicate that the dual channel system enhances the facilitating effect of coercive influence strategy on opportunism, whereas the suppressive effect of non-coercive influence strategy on opportunism works only in a dual-channel and high distributor dependence situation. This study contributes to a better understanding of marketing channels and provides novel insights for business managers.}

Strategic financial communication increasingly includes intangible assets that contribute to the value of the company. At the same time, more and more companies are publishing corporate purpose statements that are intended to express their relevance. The article acknowledges those trends and aims to assess how IROs make sense of the corporate purpose and how they strategically use it in investor relations communication. Eleven qualitative in-depth interviews with IROs from German DAX40 companies were conducted and analyzed with an abductive method. The results show that IROs focus on cues when making sense of the corporate purpose, especially links to intangible assets and organizational values can be identified. The corporate purpose is only partially used in communication with the financial public. Deepened reflection on the corporate purpose, fueled by discussions and cues, supports the sensemaking process of IROs which can be guided by the organization. The role of the corporate purpose turned out to be complex with – although not always explored – the potential to be used as a descriptive and normative tool in strategic financial communication.}

Dozens of theories and concepts including dialogue, engagement, identification, social presence, uses and gratifications, conversational human voice, and many others inform social media. However, what has commonly taken place in social media contexts and public relations has been the importation and application of other theories and concepts, rather than exploring and clarifying the unique features and capabilities of social media per se. This essay argues that social media represent a new communication paradigm, and this essay takes up the challenge of building social media theory for public relations by identifying features of social media that have emerged from existing research as fundamental to understanding social media, and eventually developing a theory(s) of social media for public relations.}

Fashion brands have begun exploring the metaverse as a new marketing platform, which is expected to bring about substantial changes in the fashion and retail industry. However, a lack of consensus on the nature of the metaverse and its impact on the fashion industry currently exists, and limited academic research is available on the metaverse's influence on fashion brands' marketing strategies and brand experiences. To address this gap, this study employs a thematic analysis approach on trade journals and industry articles that cover fashion brands' metaverse strategies. Through this analysis, the study provides a typology of current marketing strategies of fashion brands in the metaverse. Based on these empirical findings, this research proposes a theoretical framework that explains how different metaverse strategies affect different dimensions of brand equity.

Drawing on stakeholder theory and customer engagement perspective, this study analyzes banks' content posted on Facebook and Instagram from January 2021 to December 2022. The research employs multiple regression analysis to assess the relationship between CSR dimensions and consumer engagement. Results reveal that two CSR dimensions (employee support and diversity) positively arouse more engagement than non-CSR-related content. Oppositely, other CSR dimensions (environment, community support, product) provide negative or non-statistically significant results compared to non-CSR-related content. This empirical study, utilizing official data from Facebook and Instagram, contributes valuable insights into consumer engagement with CSR-related posts in the banking sector, addressing both scholarly and practical needs for understanding consumer social media engagement dynamics.}

The sample included 290 peer-reviewed articles published between 1980 and 2018 across 61 communication journals. The 9,288 foundation publications and 4,596 unique publication sources referenced by these articles were also analyzed. Results of this study reveal limited collaborations among researchers with expertise in and outside the communication discipline or across different communication sub-disciplines. The results also show a substantial influence from management and marketing perspectives on the invisible college of CSR research in communication. Moreover, the results of three longitudinal network models display the patterns of structural evolution of the scholarly collaboration and foundation literature networks, showing a maturing process of CSR knowledge construction in communication. Taken together, this study stimulates future CSR research in that it helps locate the knowledge base that may inspire new research fronts and the areas of vacancies that serve as promising venues for the discovery of CSR knowledge.}

However, in practice, place branding shares many commonalities with public relations. It involves relationships with a wide range of stakeholders, reputation management, and communication campaigns that involve no direct sale of a product. While some have noted the parallels between place branding and public relations, the intersection of these two fields has not been reviewed empirically. This study examines the relationship between public relations and place branding by exploring how scholars in each field have conceptualised and represented the other in their research publications. A systematic review of 378 journal articles, published from 1988 to 2018 in 18 selected journals from both fields, was conducted. This research shows that while there is a significant conceptual crossover between the two fields and they work together in practice, the place branding literature largely treats public relations as a promotional tactic rather than a disciplinary body of knowledge. Conversely, outside of public diplomacy research, public relations has shown little interest in places and place communication, and there is limited research applying public relations theories and concepts to places. This paper adds to current knowledge on the interdisciplinarity of public relations theories and concepts and how public relations is perceived outside its own field and suggests new possibilities for interdisciplinary research on place communication.}

In Study 2, we showed that psychological empowerment and consumer–company identification can explain the positive effects of perceived interactivity. Unlike non-participatory campaigns, participatory campaigns empower consumers and strengthen consumer–company identification through perceived consumer–company interactivity, which, in turn, positively affects perceived CSR motives, attitudes toward the company, and purchase intentions. Our studies highlight the value of consumer engagement with participatory CSR campaigns and explain why it works.

Distinguishing itself from previous research, our approach embraces a multi-perspective lens, delving into the viewpoints of both channel partners and organizations (i.e., managers). Employing an explanatory sequential mixed method design, the first phase involved an empirical survey with 248 respondents (Study 1). Subsequently, the second phase (Study 2) comprised qualitative interviews with 41 respondents. The findings from both studies converged, revealing a positive association between “consistent communication” and “attitude,” a robust connection between “attitude” and “commitment,” and a favorable correlation between “green brand identity” and “attitude,” ultimately leading to a positive relationship between “attitude” and “green tactical marketing orientation". This research significantly contributes to the comprehension of B2B green brand positioning by demonstrating, that in the B2B context, brand governance influences channel partners' commitment and tactical green marketing orientation.}

In the first part, the Delphi method was conducted to understand the fundamental issue of acceptability of the Global Capability Framework. Secondly, the study included an online survey that provided descriptive results about variations in the Global Capability Framework’s applicability within the Malaysian context. For the final part, interviews were organised to explore the views of three PR communities on the Global Capability Framework at the individual, organisational, and professional levels in Malaysia. This study is the first attempt to provide a comprehensive Global Capability Framework for the Malaysian context. We found that cultural capability should emerge as a new dimension of this framework in Malaysia's PR context. Hence, this study will benefit all PR communities in standardising and delivering a country-specific capability approach based on the Global Capability Framework to deal with national and global challenges in an increasingly complex world.}

Firms have been actively searching for solutions to survive the crisis and improve business resilience in the post-crisis phase. In developing strategic responses to the risks of failing to get through the “black swan” event, tactics such as impression management may be selected by managers to mitigate contemporary challenges. This paper aims to uncover the actions taken by organisations to manage financial information and market perceptions. It compares the effects of the strategies in normal and unprecedented situations. The empirical analysis of delisting events suggests that the application of impression management is associated with lower delisting risks; however, the effects of such tactics are attenuated in the presence of macro-environmental shocks. Further analyses of market reaction reveal that investors seem to discount all information at the time of disclosure during the pandemic, making the market reaction to impression management less favourable. This provides further support for the reduced efficiency of impression management in alleviating delisting risks following the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results have important implications for firms' development of strategies in response to external turbulence.}

Theoretically, the argument is developed with reference to the concept of corporate citizenship and cultural branding theories. Methodologically, the study applies a discourse analysis to Instagram posts and comments associated with Bodyformuk’s cultural brand campaign #bloodnormal as an illustrative case of corporate citizenship. By focusing on the interplay between the micro-processes of individual consumers’ brand interactions and macro-level cultural discourses, the study shows that a) users hold active agency in rearticulating the corporately conveyed cultural discourses and, hence, claims of corporate citizenship; and b) the brand actively uses these user-driven counter discourses as source material for continuously rematerializing corporate citizenship. The study contributes to the corporate marketing literature by highlighting the challenges of corporate centricity when the brand becomes part of a politized discourse and enacts corporate citizenship.}

This is not the case, and in this article we offer examples and concrete advice for companies of all sizes and resource levels to embed storytelling throughout the organization. Likewise, we build a case for developing organizational culture and capacity to harness the power of storytelling not only for marketing strategy, but also for overall organizational functionality.

In turbulent times of crisis, stakeholders seek credible information for their better decision-making towards firms. Therefore, it becomes essential for the CEOs to engage with the stakeholders and manage firm value strategically. This empirical study utilizes the Twitter posts of Fortune 1000 CEOs for their sustainability communication through their different orientations i.e., SDG, entrepreneurial, and leadership styles. The study employs mixed research methodology through a longitudinal event study to determine the change in the CEOs' strategic orientations, its influence on the CEOs' SM reputation, and firm performance before and during the crisis. Findings showcase that the change in CEOs' strategic orientation in their sustainability-related disclosures positively influences stakeholder engagement and the CEOs' SM reputation during a crisis. Also, the strategic orientations of the CEOs and their SM reputation as a resource provide competitive advantages to the firms for their enhanced firm financial performance. Our study contributes to both research and practice of using SM strategically for their sustainability communication to achieve improved firm performance during a crisis.}

However, this literature has barely considered the possible perception of risk associated with these recommendations on the part of consumers or the involvement of users with the product in their purchase intention. This paper fills this gap in the literature by analysing the possible interconnection between observational learning, product involvement and perceived risk on the effectiveness of influencers' recommendations. To this end, we propose a new exploratory model applying an approach grounded in observational learning and an extension of the theory of planned behaviour, analysed by means of PLS-SEM in a sample of 948 followers of influencers who recommend fashion products. The results have new implications for influencer marketing research by reporting the impact of risk on product attitude and purchase intention, although their predictive power was lower than expected. Furthermore, perceived authenticity of the message exerted the highest positive effect on attitude, and it was established as a significant mitigator of user-perceived risk. Finally, product involvement, a construct unexplored in previous studies, revealed a considerable influence on both perceived authenticity of the message and attitude.}

Employing social network perspective, this study tests the multi-dimensions of OSD on social media and examines impacts of the digital OSD on brand-centric networks based on discursive relationships among actors (i.e., organization-stakeholder and stakeholder-stakeholder relationships). By analyzing eight brands’ Facebook data using content analysis (N = 8838) and social network analysis (Nedge = 74,969), we found that two OSD dimensions (i.e., conversational handling and participation simulation) enhance the network size and interactivity of the brands’ Facebook communities as well as the brands’ structural influence (i.e., in-degree centrality, efficiency, and eigenvector centrality) in the network. The study has theoretical and practical implications for researchers and practitioners who are interested in ICT-enhanced dialogue, organization-stakeholder networks, and online brand communities on social media.}

This study examines how different levels of LGBTQ+ diversity CSR (i.e., proactive, passive, refusal) affect public responses. The proposed model investigates how public perceptions of corporate support for LGBTQ+ diversity (PCSL), influenced by CSR level, affects two dimensions of corporate associations differently (corporate ability and CSR association), and consequently CSR responses (supportive communication intent, purchase intent, and corporate evaluation in this study). The role of perceived value-driven motivation as a mediator was also examined. An online experiment was conducted with two Fortune 500 companies (Dell and Kellogg's). Overall, the results suggest that proactive CSR leads to higher PCS-L and better CSR outcomes among the general public than a passive or refusal approach. PCS-L, directly and indirectly, affects individuals’ CSR associations, which are mediated by value-driven motives. In turn, CSR associations positively influence publics’ supportive communication intent, purchase intent and corporate evaluations. As for CA associations, we found that they had a rather complicated relationship with PCS-L. Specifically, PCS-L had a direct negative effect on CA associations (Dell) or no effect (Kellogg), indicating possible backlash effects. However, higher PSC-L resulted in more favorable perceived motives of the CSR program, driven by the company's moral grounds and corporate values, consequently resulting in greater CA associations (positive indirect impact). Thus, perceived value-driven motives can offset potential backlash effects related to CA associations and corresponding CSR outcomes.}

To present the accumulated knowledge about GPR, this study used content analysis and bibliometric network analysis to systematically review 155 articles published in key public relations journals from 1976 to 2021. Our findings illustrate the status of GPR scholarship in terms of publication trends, authorship, research contexts, research topics, theoretical knowledge structure, methodological approaches, and ethical considerations. Findings suggest that GPR is a fast-growing field attracting international and multidisciplinary scholarly interests; yet has not been clearly defined and theorized. With strong theoretical roots in relationship management, GPR has the potential to develop context-relevant theories capturing the distinctive relational dynamics in various government communication situations. This study proposes a work-in-progress definition of GPR, identifies critical research gaps, and suggests future research directions to assist GPR in developing into a distinct and promising subfield of public relations research.}

Indeed, the profession’s rapid adoption of SMIs as part of their campaigns raises questions regarding the ethics of their use and the extent to which they fit with normative models of public relations practice that promote genuine dialogue and responsible advocacy. This study explores this tension between the uses and potential misuses of SMIs by examining the worldviews, strategies and practices of senior public relations practitioners at several agencies in Sydney, Australia. It proposes a new critical framework for understanding the influences that SMIs are in fact having on public relations practice, which builds on models of dialogic public relations and a critical eco-systems perspective. Ultimately, this study argues that the affordances provided by the emergence of SMIs are predisposing practitioners to persuasive strategies and covert activities that lack transparency and are inconsistent with ethical ideals of best practice for organizational public relations.}

Responding to the call to fully exploit SMIs for achieving public relations objectives, the research aimed to search for systematically identifying the most suitable SMIs with whom to collaborate for CSR endorsements. Grounded in social learning theory and the influence framework, this study examined the effects of characteristics and leadership of an SMI who endorses CSR initiatives on generating the supportive behavior towards the initiatives among the corporation’s most influential public on social media, its consumers. Results from a survey of 967 U.S. consumers showed that non-CSR-themed SMI endorsers trigger target consumers’ supportive behavior towards the CSR initiative which they have endorsed when the consumers perceive them as opinion and taste leaders. The SMI endorsers’ trustworthiness, expertise, uniqueness, and (consumer-SMI) congruity constituted their opinion leadership perceived by the consumers while expertise, uniqueness and congruity formed their taste leadership. Opinion and taste leadership fully mediated the effects of trustworthiness, expertise, and uniqueness on consumers’ CSR supportive behavior while partially mediating the impact of congruity on the CSR supportive behavior. The findings shed light on how to select effective SMIs in non-CSR domains to generate consumers’ behavior to support the CSR initiatives.}

To understand how this process works, we incorporate the personification approach to organizations, and also investigate the impact of chatbot social conversation in shaping public perceptions of corporate character (i.e., agreeableness, enterprise, competence, and ruthlessness). A survey of 778 Facebook users in the United States was conducted, where participants were randomly assigned to have a guided conversation with an AI-enabled social chatbot utilized by real companies on Facebook. Results confirm that chatbot social conversation can serve as a strong antecedent of the corporate character of the organization that deployed it and OPRs. Perceived corporate character also directly influences the quality of OPRs, demonstrating the potential of using AI-enabled social chatbots for public relations purposes.}

Yet, little research has explored public relations work from a trauma-informed approach. Building upon Macnamara’s (2016b, 2018) architecture of listening model, this study considers how public relations can help enact trauma-informed organizational listening. As such, this qualitative analysis of interviews with 54 public relations and strategic communication professionals yielded insights for listening with consideration for trauma and harm among diverse publics. Findings suggest that public relations professionals engage in trauma-informed listening via respect and sensitivity, listening out for invisible or unheard trauma, consideration of power distance, understanding that the trauma can be inflicted by communications work, and with consideration for ‘compassion fatigue.’ Combined with existing organizational listening theory, this article offers practical recommendations for how organizations can enact trauma-informed listening.}

Will chatbots be more persuasive if they are more human-like, not only in their appearance but also in their interaction and delivery of advertising content? We explored these questions with a 2 (chatbot profile: human-like vs. machine-like) x 2 (message interactivity: high vs. low) x 2 (ad type: narrative vs. factual) experiment (N = 414). Data reveal that high message interactivity fosters positive attitudes toward the chatbot and the ad by mitigating violated expectancy. Narrative ads promote chatbot advertising through perceived transportation. A three-way interaction revealed that when a chatbot is machine-like in appearance, higher interactivity and adoption of a narrative style of delivery serve to increase ad persuasiveness by heightening social presence. Theoretical and practical implications for chatbot advertising are discussed.}

By observing the most transparent Chinese charitable foundations, this study conducted a quantitative content analysis to examine their use of WeChat for dialogic communication with publics. Particularly, this study examined the dialogic features employed on the official WeChat accounts of these foundations as well as the public engagement functions fulfilled by their WeChat posts. The findings indicate that the dialogic potential of WeChat has not been fully utilized by the Chinese foundations. The official accounts have been relatively successful in fulfilling the provision of useful information toward interested publics, but most of them still have not created a dialogic loop with their audience. The WeChat posts primarily act as information sources but also perform the salient function of calling upon actions. In addition, certain communication strategies were identified in the posts to attract audience attention and to promote organizational activities, such as the incorporation of multimedia content and popular online events.}

Employing a visual social semiotic framework, a randomly selected sample of visuals posted on Instagram and Facebook by four leading airport brands in 2019 (N = 400) was coded for representational, interactive, and compositional meanings. Findings revealed that across platforms narrativity of images, and interactive features of distance and point of view enhanced engagement, while the compositional feature of framing increased engagement on Instagram.

Through four pre-registered experiments, this study compares the impacts of human and virtual influencers in social advocacy, delineating the mechanisms driving their effectiveness and identifying potential boundary conditions that might influence their relative impact. Specifically, it investigates the perceived authenticity of human versus virtual influencers and how it affects digital activism and altruistic motives. In addition, the study assesses whether the unique characteristics of virtual influencers, such as novelty and autonomy, can counterbalance their perceived deficits in authenticity and egoistic motives to potentially amplify their advocacy effectiveness. The findings suggest that the advantages of virtual influencers in commercial marketing do not necessarily translate to, or enhance their role in, advocacy for social causes. By considering the impact of egoistic motives, this study takes a novel perspective to expand the conceptualization of authenticity in influencer social advocacy. It thus calls for a strategic reevaluation of how virtual influencers are utilized in cause advocacy initiatives. The study makes a significant contribution to the ongoing dialogue on the role of influencers in catalyzing digital activism, offering insights for optimizing influencer engagement in social causes.}

This creates uncertainties for value chain actors and the trust relationships between them. In this paper we aim to understand the connections between trust and digitalisation. We investigate how trust relations affect digitalisation, and how digitalisation affects trust relations among value chain actors, using the Dutch flower sector as a case study. Our findings show that the sector has a high level of interpersonal trust, but limited institutional trust, as the relationships between companies are highly competitive and transactional. In this context, limited trust hinders digitalisation in multiple and mutually reinforcing ways, inducing a vicious cycle whereby existing distrust or limited trust results in limited digitalisation, which in turn causes more distrust due to uncertainties around the digitalisation process, further increased by existing (technological) path dependencies. Hence there is a need for 1) awareness of mutually reinforcing (dis)trust dynamics and vicious (or virtuous) cycles in relation to digitalisation are needed; 2) higher levels of understanding of what digitalisation entails and 3) joint strategy building and foresighting in the value chain.}

An online experiment among 221 general consumers in the United States was conducted. The results demonstrated that negative messages regarding CSR distributed by employees in face-to-face communication decreased publics’ favorable attitudes and behavioral intentions to a greater extent than that distributed via social media (i.e., Facebook). However, the effect of communication channel became insignificant when positive messages regarding CSR were shared by employees. The results further showed that perceived authenticity mediated the effects of channel and message valence on publics’ attitudes and behavioral intentions.

Utilizing a qualitative pre-study of 20 interviews (five buyer–supplier dyads with two interviews per firm) and more than 8000 buyer reviews on Alibaba, we identify characteristic patterns of this type of B2B eWOM. Signaling Theory and Social Exchange Theory underpin the empirical investigation. To enable further conceptualization, the study distinguishes between online B2B reviews based on the extent to which they are controlled by organizational partners. Unlike some other forms of B2B reviews, reviews on Alibaba are uncontrolled and comprise a form of eWOM. Findings indicate that the relational patterns of B2B eWOM shared on Alibaba can be aggregated into three categories: human touch, responsiveness, and resilience. Besides these new categories, the importance of product/service quality has been confirmed. Through Alibaba reviews, buyers' signals are sent not only to suppliers as feedback, but also to other prospective buyers to influence their purchase decisions. Our study aims to contribute to the B2B literature on eWOM and signaling in business relationships. By showing that human touch occurs even in online-only buyer–supplier relationships, the study provides evidence that bonding, the development of mutuality, and relationship intimacy in buyer–supplier relationships does not always require in-person contact. Managerial implications are offered with a focus on the signaling of unobservable qualities, such as human touch, with the help of B2B eWOM.}

In fact, anecdotal evidence suggests that investor relations would be quite different from other public relations specializations in its media usage. However, research on media planning is not well developed in the general field of public relations itself and pales in comparison with research in such fields as advertising and marketing. This study addresses this shortcoming by developing a new approach to measuring media usage in public relations. This approach is then tested through a survey of investor relations officers. The results indicate that the main tactic used in investor relations is one-on-one interpersonal communication.}

Grand challenges are complex by nature and call for nontrivial solutions whose effects show at the level of society. That is why studying public relations’ contribution to grand challenges requires a macro perspective that accounts for the dynamic interaction between individual, organisational, and system levels in a digital communication environment. This paper offers a new paradigm to analyse organisations’ significant and at times undue impact on grand challenges through public relations. It develops a framework inspired by complex adaptive systems thinking and adopts its ten properties for public relations: emergence, adaptivity, heterogeneous actors, nonlinear effects, feedback mechanisms, self-organisation, phase transitions, networks, scaling, and cooperation. The paper applies the framework to the example of sustainable development. It shows why research on grand challenges requires a holistic perspective and how it can help study digitally born communication phenomena. The proposed complex systems paradigm provides space for critical, social scientific, and interpretative research lines in public relations. Inquiries start from the grand challenge and study the communicative interactions between organisations and other actors from existing theory while accounting for the ten properties of complex adaptive systems. The paper outlines how future research can enrich the study of public relations and discusses its limits.}

Participants described the challenges of managing vast data streams and alignment, staying current with digital trends and technology, and dealing with the shortcoming of AI tools and algorithms. When asked about opportunities, participants described how communicators are uniquely positioned to align data and analytics efforts to help them understand audiences, foster mutually beneficial relationships with publics, and share stories with these publics and senior counsel that contribute to organizational objectives. Participants said they develop data competency among their communication teams by fostering a creative and curious culture, creating diverse teams, and championing employees.

It aims to explore media relations research in terms of progression, journals, theories, methods and data analytical tools, media genres and platforms, geospatial distribution of discussed issues and first author affiliations, organization types, most frequently used words, and major themes covered through a quantitative content analysis and a qualitative text mining approach. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 276 articles from 2006 to 2017 were collected as the final sample. Public Relations Review has published the most articles, while the most commonly used theories were agenda setting /building theory, rhetorical theory, and framing theory. Media relations articles utilize qualitative methodologies more than quantitative ones, while the commonly used data analytical tools were content analysis, interview, survey, and case study. Our analysis of the discussed regions and geospatial distribution of first-author show that the North American, European, and Asian continents and the US, the UK, China, and Australia have relatively more publications. The majority of media relations articles discussed governmental organizations. Five themes dominated media relations articles: public relations strategy, media relations practice, mass media and journalism, state–media relations, and organizational media relations.}

It starts from the premise that companies face vigilant environmental activism when developing B2B marketing strategies, focusing on identifying discrepancies between intended marketing messages and actual practices, as well as an increasingly tightening regulatory environment. The core of the paper is a systematic review of interdisciplinary research on greenwashing in the B2B context with a focus on B2B marketing implications. In particular, this study contributes to a modern understanding of greenwashing by providing a new framework for the typology, drivers, and consequences of greenwashing. It also contrasts theories that help explain the greenwashing phenomenon through an interdisciplinary perspective. Finally, this study points out the gaps in existing research on this phenomenon and offers rich future research directions.}

DivPSM is trained to identify whether a post makes mention of diversity or a diversity-related issue, and to subsequently code for the presence of three diversity dimensions (cultural/ethnic/racial, gender, and LHGBTQ+ diversity) and three diversity perspectives (the moral, market, and innovation perspectives). In Study 1, we describe the training and validation of the instrument, and examine how it performs compared to human coders. Our findings confirm that DivPSM is sufficiently reliable for use in future research. In study 2, we illustrate the type of data that DivPSM generates, by analyzing the prevalence of strategic diversity communication in social media posts (n = 84,561) of large organizations in the Netherlands. Our results show that in this context gender diversity is most prevalent, followed by LHGBTQ+ and cultural/ethnic/racial diversity. Furthermore, gender diversity is often associated with the innovation perspective, whereas LHGBTQ+ diversity is more often associated with the moral perspective. Cultural/ethnic/racial diversity does not show strong associations with any of the perspectives. Theoretical implications and directions for future research are discussed at the end of the paper.}

Furthermore, this study aims to examine the model’s strategic value by testing its relationship with transformational leadership and four organizational cultures. The results of analysis of the data from two national surveys conducted in South Korea (N = 314) and the United States (N = 314) indicate that the ACB model is reliable and valid. The results also show that transformational leadership is a significant factor that increases ACB and suggest how different organizational cultures enhance ACB across two different countries.}

They need to develop a credible and compelling line of reasoning that employees understand and can act on. Adopting the perspective of roadmapping as a strategy tool, this article advances the argument that roadmapping is especially suitable in helping firms to surmount these three critical strategic challenges. This article distills three core features of the roadmap: graphical representation, multi-disciplinary integration, and scaling. It then reviews the three critical strategic challenges and shows how roadmapping can help to overcome each of these. Following this explanation, the article describes ten key principles for effective strategic roadmapping that support firms in obtaining the strategic benefits promised. The article concludes with additional insights for practice with the intent of encouraging further exploitation of roadmapping’s potential.}

Our network analysis of foreign organizations from Latin American and their U.S. agents documents the network structures that emerge for each country and identifies the types of organizations that are positioned advantageously in the networks. We use these findings to theorize how foreign organizations’ connections and their key positions in networks may influence the production of international public relations efforts for their home country. We at a macro-level, public relations effects depend on the structure of the networks, the overlapping sites where communication content is produced, and who is positioned as key players in the production networks.}

An experimental design with two transgression scenarios (influencer vs. brand) was created, and 250 individuals were recruited to participate in the study. The results show that a perceived betrayal by a brand can negatively affect the perceived coolness of the social media influencer that has endorsed the brand, as well as the parasocial relationships that followers have with the influencer. Accordingly, a perceived betrayal by a social media influencer can negatively affect attitudes, trust and purchase intentions toward a brand that the influencer has endorsed. The current research helps in understanding brand and influencer transgressions and highlights the fact that both influencers and brands should have a sense of collaboration responsibility. It also introduces the concept of influencer coolness, understood here as a desirable success factor for social media influencers, which partly explains their desirability and influence, and a feature that can be endangered through both influencer and brand betrayals.}

On a broader level, such politically motivated advocacy is a critical facet of civil society with important implications on the societal role of public relations (Taylor, 2010). In light of the significance of politically motivated consumer advocacy to public relations, a multi-phase, exploratory study was conducted. Study 1 applies content analysis and social network analysis to examine how different interactive mechanisms on social media—retweet, mention, and reply—may affect communication within and between communities of different ideological views surrounding the boycott and buycott issues. Study 2 further explores the challenges and opportunities of fostering exchange of diverse viewpoints by identifying new social mediators—the “echoers” who propel information flow among in-group members, and the “bridgers” who initiate communication with political out-group members—and assess the key network characteristics of these social mediators. The findings of these two studies advance public relations theories on networks, intergroup communication, and civil society by illustrating how social media structure and social mediators shape the networked public discourse to facilitate or inhibit conversations between publics of different ideological orientations.}

In this research, we explore chat messages between sales agents and organizational buyers to identify which attributes are more likely to increase sales outcomes (B2B segment). Drawing from social response theory and media synchronicity theory, we develop hypotheses to understand how message content (social versus functional), message valence (positive versus negative), and message progression (synchronicity, or time between responses, and response proportion, or ratio of words typed for salesperson-buyer interactions) influence sales revenue, sales frequency, and sales conversion rates. We test this phenomenon within an auto-manufacturing firm over 714 days, where 19,817 chat conversations yielded 3433 sales. The results show that social content increased sales revenue and sales conversion rates while functional content influenced frequency. Positive message valence influenced all three outcomes while negative valence increased conversion rates. Finally, shorter response times and replies were shown to positively influence organizational buyer purchase behavior. These findings offer implications for sales organizations utilizing live sales agents in their chat platforms and present avenues for future research in this domain.}

Data were collected from 683 consumers who are familiar with AI influencers in Saudi Arabia. Our findings indicated that no single factor is sufficient to drive trust in influencers, but five causal recipes were explored for their power to secure high levels of trust in AI influencers. The findings revealed that a configuration of source attractiveness (i.e., physical attractiveness, homophily), source credibility (i.e., authenticity, expertise) and congruences (i.e., influencer, product, consumer) act as driver of consumers' trust in an AI influencer. These results are useful for practitioners since they provide new methods for boosting trust in AI influencers.}

Despite the Western-centric view of strategic communication, this study highlights the various communication strategies, such as rhetoric, symbolography, town-criers, Roko, Ewi, proverbs, idiophones, and music, that were utilized in precolonial times. The arrival of colonialists only modernized the process and introduced new mediums of communication. Modern factors such as WWII, nationalism, regional politics, civil war, Boko Haram Insurgency, and politics have also influenced the development of strategic communication. The paper recommends more research and courses on strategic communication in Nigeria to continue building a better understanding of its role in national security and conflict management.}

Our research examines the alignment of linguistic and communicative elements in sustainability communications with the actual sustainability performance of companies employing a multifaceted analytical approach including content/theme analysis, sentiment analysis, emotion detection, and readability assessments. The findings reveal that thematic content related to sustainability, emotional engagement strategies, and the clarity of communication are shown to play vital roles in enhancing consumer trust and engagement with retail and consumer services firms. Moreover, readability and polarity are critical in shaping consumer perceptions of authenticity and reliability in sustainability narratives. The study underscores the importance of transparency and authenticity in sustainability communications, demonstrating that effective messaging can significantly influence consumer engagement with retail and consumer services firms. By bridging the gap between sustainability narratives and actual practices, the research contributes to a deeper understanding of strategic communication's role in fostering sustainable consumer behavior and trust in the retail and consumer services sector.}

Organizations and their agencies have to adapt existing or even develop new management routines for planning, organizing, and controlling their influencer activities. This article provides a systematic overview on their emerging routines and rationales. On the basis of 20 explorative expert interviews with organization and agency representatives, we found that organizations deploy strategic influencer communication mainly for pursuing marketing objectives, while the potential for achieving Public Relations objectives is not fully exploited. In organizing influencer campaigns, organizations and their agencies have to balance the organization’s control expectations and the social media influencer’s demand for creative freedom. But despite the considerable investment that organizations make in strategic influencer communication, the controlling of influencer activities is only slowly coming out of its infancy. We conclude that strategic communication professionals are still learning how to best manage their influencer activities. From a conceptual perspective, we argue that strategic communication outsources traditional Public Relations functions to influencers. These outsourcing processes carry implications for theory and conceptual development in strategic communication research.}

abstract = {Using mobile devices for additional information search before, during and after watching television (either factual news or fictional TV series) - is an increasingly significant information management phenomenon. This activity has been recognised by both TV media executives and academia as ‘second screen’ activity. This paper develops and tests a ‘parasocial interaction-impulse buying’ - model that captures the behaviours of consumers watching a Chinese TV drama series. These audience-consumers were also engaging extensively (most on a daily basis) during the broadcast period with series related influencer social media activities on a second screen. A structural equation model was developed to analyse the data. Findings indicate that TV series audience consumers who are also highly engaged with influencer- consumer ‘second screen’ content are likely to experience positive narrative involvement leading to engagement in parasocial interaction behaviours and ultimately impulse buying behaviour. These findings have implications for managers by providing insights into (1) the effects of influencer second screen content (2) the processes by which consumers’ involvement in a TV show’s narrative leads to impulse buying of products. Thus, influencer related second screen consumer engagement should be considered a significant opportunity for marketers, as such activity makes consumers become more involved in the characters and the narrative of a particular TV show, leading to increased impulse buying.}

From a random sample (n = 409) collected by a cross-sectional online survey among university students, the authors found that voyeurism, content production, and content consumption have direct effects on intensity of SNS use. Furthermore, exhibitionism and voyeurism have indirect effects on intensity of SNS use through content production and content consumption. These findings support empirical evidence that the relationship between individuals’ psychological traits and their intensity of SNS use may be in fact mediated through content use.}

It starts with the idea that attention is a valuable resource in society and organizations compete for attention, increasing the quantity of content and messages and releasing them through multiple media channels. Content inflation, hyperbole, and exaggeration are the norm since competition is strong to attract attention. And, since attention is limited, this almost unlimited amount of content detracts society’s attention from more relevant collective and social problems. This article describes how contemporary public relations, especially after the implosion of social media, contributes to the Tragedy of the Commons (TOTC), providing relevant data about the impact of corporate content on journalism and social media. This article, appealing to the concept of sustainability and philosopher Byung Chul-Han’s ideas of the hypertrophy of storytelling, concludes that an ecology of PR would solve the problem and represent an inexpensive method of CSR for corporations, and that this “reduction of noise” would make the public sphere more viable.}

This study conducted an online experiment involving social media users within the United States, examining the interplay between compassion, empathetic concern, perceived impact, anticipated affect, and intentions to donate time and money. Structural equation modeling revealed that compassion influenced empathetic concern, perceived impact, and anticipated affect. Specifically, empathetic concern influenced intentions to donate time and money, while perceived impact primarily influenced monetary donations. Moreover, place attachment moderated these relationships, indicating that emotional bonds to a specific place can play a crucial role in shaping potential donors’ responses to compassion-based appeals. Our findings contribute to an understanding of how place attachment and compassion intersect in the digital age, informing innovative strategies for philanthropic campaigns on social media platforms.}

Building on the market-driven view and the dynamic capabilities view of competitive strategy, we examine SM use in a framework of market-sensing and customer-linking capabilities that influence firm performance. Our research model posits that market orientation stimulates SM use to enhance market-sensing capability thereby facilitating two customer-linking capabilities, namely customer relationship management and brand management, which collectively contribute to greater marketing performance and financial performance. Our research model is empirically tested using a survey of 143 UK B2B SMEs. The findings broadly support our theorization in which the strategic use of SM, an essential part of market-sensing capability, enhances customer-linking capabilities. Interestingly, although SM use influences brand management capability, its suggested influences on both customer relationship management capability and marketing performance occur only through the mediation of brand management capability. Both customer-linking capabilities positively influence marketing performance and in turn financial performance. Our findings provide novel conceptual and empirical advancement of how market-centric B2B SMEs strategically use SM to enhance their market-sensing and in turn customer-linking capabilities, and hence firm performance.}

By building on attribution theory and knowledge about legitimacy judgments, the current research investigates how two-sided messages, which contain both negative and positive information, affect employees’ commitment to change, through the serial mediation of credibility and legitimacy judgments. A vignette experiment with 227 participants reveals, in findings that conflict with some prior contributions, that in a change context, two-sided messages directly reduce credibility. Two-sided messages are also indirectly linked to commitment to change through the proposed serial mediation. Contrary to our hypotheses, the indirect association is negative. The study thereby adds to research on strategic communication and legitimacy during organizational change and provides valuable insights for practitioners regarding the use and context-specific limited persuasiveness of two-sided messages.}

However, the state of knowledge about its structure and evolution remains unexplored. Who are the key players and what are the key works in the global public relations literature?

This study answers these questions by using bibliometric methods to examine published articles in scholarly global public relations research from 1983 to 2019. A total of 35,982 citations from 521 articles permit us to conclude that the field of global public relations has experienced exponential growth, especially during the last decade. Public Relations Review has been the primary outlet for publishing articles on global public relations. The topics of interest during this period can be generally categorized into three groups: culture or cultural dimensions of global public relations, application of public relations theories (e.g., Excellence Theory) and perspectives to other countries, and the introduction of public relations in other countries. The topic of public relations roles appeared in research only in 2000−2009, while public diplomacy emerged as a new theme in the literature in 2010−2019.}

Employing structural equation modeling (SEM), this study analyzed experimental survey data collected from 601 Indonesian Instagram users in August 2023. The findings reveal that eWOM valence positively affects consumer brand attitudes and perceived brand quality, subsequently driving online engagement and purchase intentions. The study challenges established relationships by demonstrating how brand attitude and perceived brand quality mediate the influence of eWOM valence. Additionally, this study highlights the critical moderating roles of eWOM credibility and influencer familiarity in strengthening the impact of eWOM valence. This research scrutinizes a context not widely explored in the current literature of eWOM studies by integrating these moderators and focusing on the dynamic interactions within social media platforms, providing new insights for digital marketers and social media influencers aiming to enhance consumer engagement and purchase intentions in the digital domain.}

Research topics on internal communication have diversified since 2000, from descriptive studies illustrating internal communication practices to a variety of relevant phenomena on employee and organizational outcomes. Public relations theories, such as organization–public relationship and symmetrical communication, have been frequently applied in internal communication research. In terms of methodology and sample, quantitative and qualitative methods have been equally utilized, and employees from multiple organizations were frequently used as a type of sample in a large portion of research works. The most productive researchers and institutions of internal communication research in public relations were also identified. Implications for ongoing internal communication research in public relations disciplines are discussed.

To understand how governments market their value in environments of elite competition, I compare Canadian, Irish, and Norwegian narratives while campaigning for seats on the Security Council. Results of a strategic narrative analysis suggest Ireland told the strongest stories, creating an authenticity as the ‘nation of storytellers’ that maximized its valuation. Norway failed to substantively articulate the motivation behind its foreign policy, likely impacting brand loyalty among stakeholders. Canada had the weakest storytelling, with self-referential narratives lacking a sense of care that discredited, and at times even contradicted, the mutuality of it serving on the council. I posit these varying storytelling approaches contribute to understanding the campaigns’ disparate ROIs. Contextualizing strategic narratives as value propositions expands the interdisciplinarity of government public relations scholarship at the nexus of international relations, public diplomacy, and nation branding. I conclude by operationalizing system, identity, and issue narratives to highlight how practitioners can maximize organizational value through wholistic storytelling.}

While as a consumer, one may buy from firms that show sensitivity to climate change and sustainability practices; however, when it comes to investing, they may behave the opposite. Scholarly research has predominantly examined the sustainability crisis and its implications in B2C settings. However, the issue is under-researched and more pertinent to B2B firms' practices as climate change is largely affected by the adopted industrial practices in the value chain and manufacturing process, which may not be environmentally friendly. In B2B firms, it is a complex scenario given that several value chain partners and intermediaries are involved, and their practices need to be aligned and integrated with the firm's sustainable development agenda. This tension naturally raises a question, i.e., what strategies B2B firms should adopt to generate stakeholders' value in view of the critical climate change risks? In attempting to resolve this pertinent challenge, our study provides a framework linking climate change risks to the firm's brand strategy, customer engagement, and, finally, to stakeholders' value. In developing our framework, we consider key contingency factors related to the firm, customer, and country. We also provide managerial guidance for B2B firms in mitigating the direct and indirect effects of the climate crisis and suggest directions for extending research on climate change risks and sustainability practices.}

abstract = {Given the critical role of legitimacy in attracting key resources for organizational survival and growth, organizational and strategic communication research has long sought to understand the mechanisms essential in improving organizational legitimacy. Guided by stakeholder research and configurational thinking, we examine three interconnected communication mechanisms for relationship management in organizational legitimation: (a) information visibility, (b) organizational listening, and (c) cross-sector partnerships. Based on survey and archival data from 44 U.S. nonprofit organizations, we employed a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to identify the pathways to high or low organizational legitimacy. Our results reveal the combinations of these factors can complement or substitute for one another to explain legitimacy. Specifically, high pragmatic legitimacy requires effective listening to stakeholders and collaborating with government agencies. By contrast, in low pragmatic legitimacy, organizations are often hindered by limited capacity for information visibility, ineffective listening to stakeholders, and no collaboration with corporate partners. These results suggest theoretical contributions to stakeholder research in public relations and organizational and strategic communication scholarship, as well as practical implications for improving organizational legitimacy for mission-driven organizations.}

Findings are based on 14 expert interviews as well as a quantitative survey of 128 heads of investor relations departments as well as financial communication experts within the public relations department from the largest listed corporations in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. This study shows that the departments distinguish their roles and tasks mostly by audience group. Overall, the need for and frequency of coordination is perceived as high, however it remains largely informal and event-driven. We document a strong focus on content- and timing-related integration, while strategic integration is lacking. Findings show that higher levels of integration are associated with a better working atmosphere, a broader set of instruments for coordination, and more alignment in both objectives and evaluation. We highlight the benefits of more strategic coordination and integration by comparing distinct levels of integration.}

However, some of these places were subsequently ‘ruined’ due to related impacts associated with the type of visitor behaviors that are social media-induced. It is thus critical to better understand how to overcome such issues by discerning salient destination response strategies that cater to the cognitive biases of such travelers. This research explains the effectiveness of behavioral intervention approaches to manage the impacts of social media-induced tourism by analyzing four destination strategies that have addressed photographic practices: 1) Vienna, Austria, 2) Faroe Islands, 3) Yellowstone National Park, USA, and 4) Gion District of Kyoto, Japan. The key findings that carry theoretical and practical significance include the explication of tourists' cognitive biases targeted by various behavioral interventions, and the leveraging of social media as a tool to implement choice architecture that sublety encourages desirable traveler behaviors congruent to each destination among social media-heavy travelers. The applications of this study are relevant to communities struggling with a scenario of overdevelopment due to popularity on social media and are therefore receiving increasing deterioration in quality of life.}

This paper defines the ecosystem as external stakeholders interdependent on a focal firm, and shows how such stakeholders play different roles as disruption unfolds. Focusing on incumbent firms and their ecosystems, this paper describes and categorizes the role of ecosystem stakeholders across various stages of disruption. Two cases on the disruption caused by digitalization in the advertising sector are analyzed. A processual ecosystem stage model is developed including the following roles: reassuring, questioning, unbalancing, and settling. These roles point at the reliance on past stakeholders during disruption, and show how new stakeholders come into play. Most disruption research has focused on how new actors replace incumbent firms or the sector-level disorder. The ecosystem lens centered on an incumbent brings a fresh perspective on such firms' efforts to survive and shows how interdependencies in the ecosystem play out when disruption takes place. The processual stage model, which delineates the different roles of ecosystem stakeholders during a disruption, offers valuable new insights to the existing disruption literature.}

Four research questions were addressed in an online survey among 2,324 practitioners who work in PR departments of organisations or in PR agencies across Europe. Results show that PR practitioners face more moral challenges in their daily work than they have faced in the past. Regarding digital communication tools and practices, they report moral concerns especially related to using bots, exploiting personal data for big-data analyses, paying social media influencers, and using sponsored content. Personal values and beliefs are the most important resource for dealing with moral issues—whether because only a minority of practitioners has participated in any formal ethics training within the past three years, or because existing ethical guidelines are outdated. Results call for the development of ethical guidelines that can provide explicit advice in the area of digital communication. Furthermore, structured training programs and ethics courses in graduate programs are needed to enhance practitioners’ ethical knowledge.}

Further, contamination concerns moderate the relationships between values and attitudes as well as attitudes and intentions. The findings enrich the literature of collaborative consumption by integrating theories of consumption value and consumer contamination. Furthermore, the results provide managerial implications for strategic communication of FRS to effectively reach consumers depending on their contamination concern.}

Hence, they are engaging in market-shaping to proactively augment existing business opportunities or to create new ones. One of the recurring themes in the emerging market-shaping literature is the importance of value propositions. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to identify configurations of value proposition characteristics that are effective for focal firms engaging in market-shaping strategies. In our empirical study, we analyze market-shaping actions carried out by 21 case firms using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. We identify four characteristics of market-shaping value propositions: (1) enhanced resource integration and related support as the core content of market-shaping value propositions, and (2) collaborative value proposing process, (3) systemic and verified value promise, and (4) new representations used in communication as the design characteristics of market-shaping value propositions. Further, we show that even though value propositions can shape markets without displaying all four of these characteristics, none of these characteristics alone can create all the expected outcomes. Hence, we identify distinct configurations of value proposition characteristics that are successful in either changing the elements comprising the market system or inducing an overall system-level market change.}

However, it is important not to make decisions based on anecdotal evidence, but rather to conduct formative research with key stakeholders and employ two-way, symmetrical communication strategies fundamental to dialogic theory and ethical public relations practice. When students at a large public university petitioned to change the campus newspaper's name, the Daily Forty-Niner, because of its parallel connection with the California Gold Rush that resulted in thousands of Native Americans' deaths, understanding the opinions of the university's key stakeholders became critical. Through an online survey with students, faculty, administrators, staff, and alumni (N = 2542), this study assessed understanding of the name's history, knowledge of the controversy behind it, and the desire to change the name. Results showed that more than 60% of key stakeholders believed the name to be tied to the Gold Rush; however, less than a third were aware of the controversy surrounding the paper's name. There was also no overall consensus regarding changing the name, with 27.6% supporting a name change, 36.7% opposing it, and 35.7% indicating no preference. Reasons behind participants' responses are discussed in depth, and results from this study are presented within the tenets of dialogic theory to highlight how key stakeholders' perceptions can inform such decisions. While this research can serve as a valuable foundation for other campuses and organizations facing DEI issues, we recommend conducting further research, especially with Native stakeholders and other affected groups, as well as establishing ongoing dialogue before and during the decision-making process.}

Employing a quasi-experimental design, we analyze a national retail chain’s various featured product weekly advertisements across the transaction records of 1817 products in 225 different product categories that cover a year of sales. All three-product types had a significant moderating effect on increasing the sales volume of the featured products when placed on the interior page feature location. For example, the interior pages are often ignored unless the recipient is sufficiently interested to flip through other parts of the flyer. Placing high-priced products, low-frequency products, and highly perishable products in the interior page feature location led to advertising effectiveness. In terms of frequency, the sales volume of high-frequency products were consistently higher than low-frequency products regardless of the location. On the other hand, the front and back page are the most visible pages of a flyer. In these two most visible locations, placing products that perish quickly maximized the effectiveness of using a flyer. These results highlight the importance of considering these three product types when making retail promotion decisions, including where retailers should position featured products within advertisements.}

Corporations had to: (a) have an associated corporate foundation, and (b) be listed on one of the four global stock markets selected when the creation of their foundation was announced. Data were collected for 300 corporations using the FACTIVA database. 22 corporations were found to meet the inclusion criteria. An event model allowed calculation of cumulative abnormal returns (CARs). A dependence model analyzed the relationships between CARs and selected characteristics. Findings show factors that increase the positive impact on the stock market: (1) omitting mention of the foundation’s financial resources from announcements about the foundation’s creation, and (2) basing the brand architecture on an endorsed brand strategy.}

The authors critically analyze the publics and OPR literature, furthering past criticisms and raising new questions about the heuristic value of OPR research. The paper points out three major weaknesses of the OPR tradition in its use of publics: (1) serious vacillation in terms resulting in conceptual inconsistencies, (2) inappropriate operationalization of variables and the use of probability sampling, and (3) a lack of insightful context and inclusion of relationship factors in OPR studies, to which publics are inextricably bound. The critique cautions scholars engaged in OPR research to improve their literature reviews and to enlarge their methodologies beyond a narrow scope of relational variables, which are theoretically fragile if not devoid of research value. Finally, the critique suggests the importance of conceptualizing publics in ways that acknowledge their agency.}

Employees posting work-related content on social media are considered credible sources of information and have significant importance for how stakeholders, such as potential customers and future employees, perceive the organization. Therefore, employees’ ability to communicate about their work on social media has become a competitive advantage both for individual employees and for their organizations, especially in the professional service sector. Hence, understanding the role of employees’ ability to use these social media professionally is crucial for understanding the communicative behaviors of contemporary knowledge workers. In this study, we draw on social cognitive theory and focus on the antecedents and consequences of self-efficacy in individuals’ work-related communication on social media. The results show that perceived organizational commitment, clarity of communicative role, social media training, and prior experience with social media serve as antecedents of communication self-efficacy and subsequent work-related communication on social media. Thus, organizations and particularly management, have several aspects directly within the scope of their control that may aid employees in engaging in the professional use of social media. The paper contributes to the literature on employees’ communication behavior and provides important and actionable insights for management and the development of human resources.}

In an empirical study involving 292 participants concerning two animated spokescharacters (“Tuniu” and “Three Squirrels”), we obtained the following findings: (1) The characteristics of ASCs (likeability, expertise, and congruence) are positively related to parasocial interaction relationships (PSRs) and advertisement effects; (2) PSRs fully mediate the relationship among likeability and ASC congruence and advertisement effects but partially mediate between ASC expertise and advertisement effects; and (3) adult playfulness moderates the effect of ASC likeability on advertisement effectiveness. This research expands the study of the effects of ASCs on advertising and enriches our understanding of the positive associations of ASCs.}

Often such discourses unravel into splintered and negative conversations, raising the question whether organizations can and should exercise some level of control and ‘steering’ in these conversations and, if so, how stakeholders would react to such ‘top down’ moderation. Existing studies lack empirical insights into the impacts of different levels of moderation in social media conversations on stakeholder attitudes. Two experimental studies were developed to test the effect of different levels of organizational moderation on stakeholder attitudes towards organizations. We show that increased levels of moderation negatively affect attitudes towards an organization, satisfaction with an organization's performance, and trust in the organization. Increased moderation also significantly undermines beliefs in the commitment of the organization to its stakeholders and control mutuality. This paper extends recent qualitative attempts to build new theory around stakeholder dialogues on social media by testing the effects of varying levels of moderation in such dialogues.}

The four assumptions mean that over the last decade, dialogue has been implicitly and explicitly treated as both a panacea for public relations, and a practice that is impractical and too difficult to use. This article attempts to reconcile the various dialogic perspectives by specifying the tenets of dialogue, and using them to explain why two-way communication and two-way symmetry are not dialogue. We then challenge the normative bias in current conceptualizations of dialogue in public relations by identifying the existence of what we call “negative spaces,” or contexts, where dialogue is not possible or appropriate.}

Competing and conflicting views and attitudes result in more schisms and disengagement. In addition, conflicts and disagreements on various issues also have resulted in a lack of trust and a reluctance of organizations and publics to engage in meaningful communication. As a result, developing trusting relationships by facilitating dialogues is significant. Trust has been an important construct in past research on organization-public relationships. However, the concept of trust has rarely been discussed in-depth in public relations literature. This special section of Public Relations Review, entitled Enhancing Dialogue and Trust in Diverse Societies, examines whether the current definitions of trust and its dimensions in the public relations literature are adequate in an organization-public dialogic communication setting.}

This is a significant knowledge gap as SMIs can assist policymakers and healthcare professionals in reaching the general public. The present study addresses this gap by examining how Indian SMI's features and activities can influence their followers' willingness to vaccinate by employing source credibility and uses and gratification theory. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), we used cross-sectional data from 746 Indians (North capital region) to test the measurement and structural model grounded in two theoretical lenses. The results show that SMIs positively and significantly influence their followers' inclination to take the COVID-19 vaccine. This positive relationship strengthens the SMI's relationship with their followers from the COVID-19 vaccine perspective (Vaccine information and awareness). Moreover, the perceived threat of social isolation (PTSI) moderates the relationship between trust in the vaccines and the willingness to take them and promotes the understanding of anti-vaccine behaviors. Also, the study confirms the mediation role of vaccine information and awareness among features of SMI's and trust in the vaccine. This study contributes to the current literature by proposing social media influencers as the COVID-19 savior. Additionally, the moderation role of the perceived threat of social isolation (PTSI) offers unique insights into how contextual and individual factors can affect SMI followers.}

This study follows a qualitative empirical research design, using a new dataset based on 32 interviews with experts conducted in six international automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). To improve generalization, the perspectives of volume, premium, and entry-level manufacturers are included. The four most relevant indicators are high customer relevance, strategic fit, high communication potential, and vision potential.

This study seeks to understand the agonistic reputational wrangle facilitated by cancel culture using an original theoretical framework that combines the rhetorical paradigm from public relations with deviance theory from sociology and media studies. Specifically, this study analyzes the cancellation and reputational repair strategies of four celebrities—Louis C.K., Logan Paul, Jussie Smollett, and J.K. Rowling. It utilizes large-scale social media sentiment analysis to reveal varying degrees of reputational decay and recovery. The study shows that factors impacting the severity of cancellation and the likelihood of reputational recovery include distinguishing between criminal acts and controversial opinions, as well as social variables and the strength of a parasocial relationship between a celebrity and their fandom.}

Results indicate 6 corporate topics and 9 non-profit topics, which were explicated by referencing organizations’ original writing. It is further shown that stakeholder expectations and institutional factors not only affect whether or not corporations report LGBTQ efforts, but also affect what topics they highlight in CSR reports. Corporations in democratic countries with substantial stakeholder expectations emphasize areas that need high investment and exceed legal obligations.}

This theme is considered within the context of the Korean culture of Shim-Cheong, a state focused on “we-ness,” and Cheong. The study results reveal three important aspects of empathy for public relations practitioners: 1) an empathic appraisal that allows evaluation of public emotions, 2) a sensitivity that enables detection of/predicts a change in public mood, and 3) sympathetic arousal that ensures sincere communication of empathy in a crisis. When the public perceives organizations and their issues as problematic, public affect changes from positive to negative. Empathy as capacity, intuition, and attitude allows public relations practitioners to determine when public affect has significantly changed South Koreans in the culture of Shim-Cheong. Since South Koreans tend to express positive moods more readily than negative emotions, practitioners can use an affect monitoring system to identify social trends and perform more in-depth analyses to assess contextual meanings and identify potential risks.}

This study builds on the Symbiotic Sustainability Model (SSM) to examine the content of messages passed in representational networks on social media and their related public reactions. Based on a panel analysis of one year of Facebook data generated by 605 public organizations in Taiwan, this study reveals that referencing certain topics such as economic and technological development and employing linguistic features demonstrating efficacy, formality, and empathetic concern in Facebook messages was associated with an increased diversity of alliance ties reported by public organizations. Moreover, the relationship between communicating diverse alliance ties and positive public reactions in the form of likes went both ways. Integrating automated topic modeling, linguistic analysis, and panel analysis, this study provides a process-based and communication-centered view of the mechanisms and disparities underlying organizations’ strategic network management on social media.}

abstract = {In the last three decades, the theory of strategic conflict management has been developed so that it is a strong framework for considering the factors that influence an organization’s response to crises and identifying the importance for dynamic and flexible approaches to crisis decision-making and communication. While leadership is considered one of the critical internal contingency factors but individual characteristics of key decision-makers, like the CEO, are also one of the most understudied ones. At the same time, the concept of optimism has long been explored as a factor influencing performance and positive outcomes in many arenas, but with scant evidence in the application to senior-level leadership or crisis contexts. In fact, in the crisis literature where optimism and pessimism is addressed, it largely argues that crisis leaders should adopt a pessimistic mindset. For this study senior-leaders in multinational companies responsible for managing employees in an average of 70 countries each and with extensive crisis leadership experience reflect on their own experiences during crises. Findings indicate that optimism is a critical trait in successful crisis leadership connecting to positive outcomes for the teams and organizations. These data also provide critical insights that develop a stronger understanding of contingency planning in crisis management because we have identified a trait that amongst an elite group of managers with extensive crisis experience was consistently attributed to their own success as crisis leaders.}

In Study 3, we found a similar effect by directly manipulating cognitive busyness: participants memorized long or short number strings while performing a shopping task.

Our findings demonstrate the common trends and differences between regions or societies. Scholars from North America dominated this field and primarily used quantitative methods, such as content analysis and experiments. A Western-oriented situational crisis communication theory was the most frequently applied theoretical framework. Twitter and Facebook were the most frequently used social media tools, and natural crises were studied most frequently. Nearly half of the SMCC studies collected research data about crises within America, and none focused on African countries. Contextual factors, such as political, cultural, and media characteristics, were found to affect online crisis communication practices. Our study can thus inform future discussions by revealing current theoretical gaps.}

The study then tested the effect of the variation of the same strategy on the public’s responses using three experiments. The findings revealed that an explicit apology was more effective than an implicit apology, while an apology with corrective action was even more effective than an apology alone. Internal scapegoating significantly harmed an organization compared to external scapegoating. Following the results of the study, researchers are encouraged to review their crisis response strategy manipulations to ensure the internal validity of experimental studies in crisis communication.}

To do this, 1805 employees from 12 large corporations participated in a national study exploring the relationship between employee engagement, employer brand, perceived organizational support and internal communication satisfaction. The results showed a significant and positive relationship between all measured variables. Regression analysis suggests that three independent variables (employee engagement, employer brand measured through employer attractiveness, and perceived organizational support) predicted and explained 78.9 per cent of the variation in internal communication satisfaction. These findings have practical and theoretical implications and underline the importance of understanding what influences employee satisfaction as well as helping shape better internal communication practices.}

Drawing on social identity theory and social exchange theory, we argue that when employees perceive their firms as being socially responsible, they are more likely to engage in OCBs, ultimately resulting in increased individual performance. Additionally, drawing on signaling theory, this process is strengthened when it occurs in an organization with a more, as opposed to less, ethical environment. Utilizing a large multi-source and multi-industry sample, we test our hypotheses by employing a latent moderated mediation technique and find strong support for this model.}

Based on qualitative case studies, we developed two bricolage-based models to represent different motives, different processes of resource acquisition, and different processes of resource utilization when implementing CSV. For the MNCs, both based in Hong Kong, institutional advocacy and recognition provided encouragement to engage in CSV. Internal resource slack underpinned their ability to implement their respective CSV projects by repurposing internal resources or infusing them with purpose. By contrast, the SMEs, two from Pakistan and one from Hong Kong, found it necessary to adopt collective bricolage for their respective CSV projects, involving repurposing external human resources while drawing on donations or grants and enlisting the collaboration of benevolent external experts or giants. Interviewees indicated that all the focal CSV projects were distinguishable from corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects, in that the former (but not the latter) were designed to create economic revenue for the respective focal firms, while concurrently generating social/environmental benefits. Most of the CSV projects were reported to have created significant economic value for external beneficiaries.}

The purpose of this study is to examine how CSR brings relational outcomes when intergroup dynamics are considered. Through an experimental design where a public’s identity threat was manipulated, the study suggests that CSR leads to relational outcomes through establishing identity congruity and a public’s self-expansion (validating and affirming one’s identity through the organization). Moderated mediation analysis also showed that the indirect effect of CSR on the relational outcome through congruity became greater when participants were exposed to potential identity threat. The study provides important implications for how we approach and understand the connections between a public and an organization.}

The model is built on the basis of the related literature and the collaboration of a Customer Relationship Manager in a large bank in Iran. Then, a multi-channel segmentation model is developed based on the RFM variables of the five banking channels for each customer. Next, about 11,000 customers of the bank is segmented by comparing the k-means and DBSCAN algorithms. Finally, by adapting customer segments on the value co-creation framework, three general groups are identified based on the type of encounter that lies in each channel.

It uses computational social science methods to analyze 1,909,370 comments posted on 249 videos published on a YouTube channel that unboxes technological products. The findings show that many end-users offer business advice to digital influencers as if they are collaborating with a buddy entrepreneur. A quantitative procedure demonstrates that these individuals have more subscribers than the average end-user. Further, the percentage of comments on this interaction correlates positively with end-user (consumer) engagement. This relationship indicates that a digital influencer's ability to inspire entrepreneurial behavior among end-users may benefit his/her business. It also suggests the existence of an entrepreneurship-related continuum from consumers to digital influencers.}

Results show that the utilitarian motivations of life efficiency and information influence all post-consumption evaluations and behavioral intentions positively (i.e., users’ attitudes, satisfaction, and intentions to continue using voice AI assistants). However, social motivations are also important. Social interaction and conformity motivations also influence user satisfaction, and the conformity motivation shapes individuals’ intentions to continue using voice AI assistants. The findings further demonstrate that users’ motivations influence perceptions of their voice AI assistants’ roles. In keeping with the “Computers Are Social Actors” (CASA) paradigm, users motivated by social interaction are likely to perceive a voice AI assistant as socially attractive and as a friend, whereas users motivated by life efficiency are likely to perceive it as an assistant. Users motivated by information are more likely to perceive a voice AI assistant as technology, while those motivated by social interaction are less likely to do so. The implications of these findings are discussed, and recommendations for future research are provided.}

In this essay, we review conceptions of the organization in several areas of public relations scholarship and find complexity that is unexplained by theory, causing a disconnect between public relations scholarship and practice. Using insights from stakeholder theory, essential contract theory, and intersectionality, we provide a new definition of the organization and 14 propositions about the nature of organizations. This definition is explained with a metaphor of an organization as a tent. The tent is composed of many stakeholders, each with multiple identities, utilizing contracts as poles to push and pull the organization in their preferred direction. An illustrative example is given of how this metaphor operates in a university. We call for a reorientation of public relations theory's relationships to organizations and suggest an important role for public relations and communication in constituting the nature of organizations and ensuring representativeness in decision-making.}

Additionally, the results depict that a pro-environment attitude mediates the relationship between pro-environment value and pro-environment purchase intention of electric vehicles. Finally, this paper contributes to theory in the adoption literature by proposing an alternate perspective considering “value-attitude-behavior” linkages, particularly pro-environment behavior.

The paper adopts a deep neural network-based prediction model for conducting sentiment analysis on heterogeneous datasets. We construct a sentiment simulation model of voluntary disclosures to know whether the managers can use the market sentiment as a strategic input to boost market performance by suitably drafting the tone and content of disclosures without compromising their quality and veracity. The Deep Neural Networks with LSTM algorithm is found to outperform the Deep Neural Networks with RNN and other baseline machine learning classifiers in terms of predictive accuracy of the NSE NIFTY50. The variable importance computed also validates that market news, combined with historical indicators, predicts the stock market trend closer to the actual trend.}

Furthermore, the relations between coping self-efficacy and the evaluations of the OTA varied, depending on levels of product involvement.

This conceptual essay defines brandstanding as an organization (corporation, nonprofit, or government agency) taking a public stance on a contentious issue (generally, outside of its industry or core purpose) while articulating its corresponding values and maintaining authenticity. It further describes the phenomenon in four components: (1) organizational and stakeholder values, (2) authenticity, (3) engagement, and (4) measurement. Understanding the role of each can help PR practitioners guide organizations toward informed participation in civic discourse. While some have encouraged an approach that minimizes contention (i.e. Argenti, 2020), this essay uses moral decoupling theory to argue that reducing the distance between what they say and how they act (Dowell & Jackson, 2020; Weiner, 2021) and striving for authenticity—the continuity, credibility, integrity, and symbolism of an organization’s stance (Morhart et al., 2015)—should be the most crucial factors in engagement decisions.}

Such impact, idiosyncratic to universities’ unique and complex sociopolitical role, justifies their corporate social responsibility (CSR) as organizational legitimacy, license to operate. Judged against strategic issues management’s (SIM) rationale for using stakeholder expectations to define legitimacy gaps (between organizational impact and stakeholder expectations), the engagement role unique to universities tests their functional and moral ability to enact themselves constructively in communities where they operate and in society at large. Stakeholder voices of all kinds engage to set CSR standards as means for improving the qualitative functioning of society; no society can be better than the organizations that engage to draw conclusions and create norms by which to enact it. Unique CSR engagement roles of universities include (1) elevating the functional and moral standards which guide them, (2) engaging in internal and external public arenas to foster constructive social impact, and (3) fostering research, teaching, and community service as engagement that produces social change by raising standards of moral and functional impact. This aspirational principle focuses attention as to whether universities’ CSR/legitimacy efforts reinforce hegemony or seek constructive social change.}

Based on case study data, our research highlights drivers and barriers prevailing in the mining innovation system affecting technology developers and establishes links to key innovation processes relevant to these firms. We complement these findings with insights into strategies firms employ to mitigate or overcome barriers identified, with the potential to positively affect innovation processes at the firm level.

The novelty of the approach lies in the assessment of renewable energy at the regional level in the context of the global economic and pandemic crises, which have been determining factors in the current geo-political and economic developments. We also aim to create energy sustainability clusters in the presence and absence of seasonality. The methods and procedures used will be represented by a critical literature review in order to verify the working hypotheses and to design, test and validate a new statistical model of energy sustainability seasonality. The modelling results will enable the creation of an EU-wide sustainability profile useful to supranational decision-makers for adjusting energy policies to ensure the energy transition towards 2050.}

Structural equation modeling results of 660 online survey responses suggest that OPDC has a positive association with communal relationships and negative association with exchange relationships. Facilitation behavior positively contributes to exchange relationships. Both communal and exchange relationships are positively associated with employees’ positive megaphoning. Yet, negative megaphoning is negatively linked with communal relationships and positively linked with exchange relationships. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on internal CSR communication and management. More importantly, it uncovers the nuanced effects of CSR on employee-organization communal and exchange relationship building.}

The originality lies in the comparison of five different training methods: face-to-face, videoconference, non-tutored e-learning, tutored e-learning, and serious games. The qualitative study reveals that serious games create value according to five dimensions: conception, optimization, cognition, emotion, and socialization. The four recommendations are: (1) to integrate serious games into a wide-ranging training protocol; (2) to balance face-to-face and distance-learning phases; (3) to assess knowledge transfer and to check that learners can use what they learned in the real world; and (4) to ensure learner self-awareness and enhance cognitive engagement.

Surprisingly and in contrast to prior studies, the results show that the combination of complementary leadership behaviors did not lead to the highest (lowest) level of employees’ desirable (undesirable) affective, cognitive, and behavioral change responses. This study reveals that organizations are well-advised not to disregard people orientation when going digital as this leadership behavior buffers the potential downsides of digital transformation–oriented leadership behavior, which is mandatory to stay competitive in the digital era.}

abstract = {In this article we follow a range of significant academics, practitioners and policy makers in highlighting the need to engage with the disruptive digital transformation of the fourth industrial revolution. Often called universe 4.0, this is an economy based on data that dilutes, in an unprecedented fashion, the boundaries between the physical, biological and digital world in all spheres of society. In having to face up to the uncertainty, complexity and speed associated with this global challenge, organisations of all kinds will be impelled to rethink future skills, jobs and business models. We focus on how this uncertain situation affects public relations. We suggest that the resulting paradoxes and controversies become an opportunity to research and reflect on the past and present of our discipline and redirect attention to the processes, strategies, and tools of intervention required for improved contemporary and future effectiveness. This present study analyses universe 4.0 processes affecting both the practice and the social function of public relations and argues for close linkages with multidimensional strategic intelligences and disruptive technologies based on artificial intelligence. It also involves conducting exploratory qualitative research based on a bibliometric analysis of specialised literature; undertaking content analysis via computational linguistics techniques; and applying Delphi methodology to consider public relations in universe 4.0. Our findings suggest not only that strategic intelligence is under researched in our field, but that a more developed public relations intelligence capable of adapting to universe 4.0 needs to be a hybrid of existing public relations and contemporary strategic intelligence.}

abstract = {The study explores Polish and Russian governments’ communication efforts to shape international news coverage of the 2010 airplane crash near Smolensk, Russia, which killed the Polish President Lech Kaczynski and most of his Cabinet. More specifically, the study attempts to assess the role of government communication in shaping the international agenda regarding the crash vis-à-vis the role of Polish and Russian media outlets which also served as information sources for international media. In addition, it examines politico-cultural proximity and economic relatedness as the factors influencing the outcomes of mediated public diplomacy efforts. The findings suggest that, in addition to the governments’ public relations messages, Polish and Russian news outlets played a significant role as their countries’ advocates in determining the international media agenda. Moreover, we found that it was economic relatedness rather than the similarity of culture or political systems that contributed to the success of governments in shaping the international agenda about the crash. Theoretical and practical implications for public relations and public diplomacy are discussed.}

abstract = {Business-Nonprofit Partnership (BNP) has been widely regarded as a vital approach for public value creation and social innovation. At the same time, many studies show a positive association between the size of an organization's portfolio of partners and its overall performance and innovation. Building on these insights, we contribute to the BNP literature by drawing on the relational view to theorize and empirically examine the conditions that underpin the effectiveness of nonprofit organizations (NPOs) in establishing collaborative linkages with the private sector (i.e. to determine the size of their portfolio of business partners). Data were compiled from the websites of NPOs (n = 102) that were collaborating with FTSE 100 companies. The results of regression analysis show that the ability of NPOs to deliver economic rent (to business partners) and to establish calculative trust (pre-collaboration trust) is positively associated with their portfolio size. Furthermore, the results indicate that the ability to create social value is also positively associated with portfolio size but only for larger NPOs, and that the delivery of collaboration options is negatively associated with portfolio size. We discuss these findings in relation to their implications for research and practice.}

The article presents a set of simulative experiments carried out through an agent-based computational laboratory (Computational Laboratory of Organizational Design-CLOD), to explore the eventual benefits on organizational performances obtained through informal coordination mechanisms based on natural language. Main results of the research show that internal coordination mechanisms based on informal systems, like the natural language, allow organizations to achieve better performances under different external and internal conditions. Particularly, in turbulent environments the coordination through natural language provides the organizations with additional capabilities to adapt to changing external requirements.}

abstract = {This study connected framing theory with corporate social responsibility (CSR) communication literature to examine whether a CSR message that emphasizes customers’ contribution to CSR efforts can enhance CSR communication and mitigate the negative effects of skeptical comments from other users on social networking sites (SNSs). Specifically, this study examined whether a customer-credit-sharing CSR message, compared to a conventional self-promoting message, better mitigated the effects of skeptical comments from other SNSs users on values-driven motives perceived by customers, customers’ positive attitudes, and behavioral intentions. It also explored whether the effects of strategic framing changed when skeptical comments were made online by friends or strangers. A total of 400 customers participated in an online between-subjects experiment. The results showed that the credit-sharing message better protected perceived values-driven motives and positive attitudes toward the company after the customers were exposed to skeptical comments, regardless of who posted the skeptical comments. Customers who read the credit-sharing message also showed stronger intention to defend the company’s CSR efforts and stronger purchase intention when the skeptical comments came from a friend. More theoretical and practical implications are discussed.}

abstract = {This study introduces a framework of persuasive communication that is central to understanding how individual purchasers behave as boundary spanners to manage customer–supplier relationships. Drawing on the institutional theory and multiple governance approach, we assume authoritarian, competitive, and relational behavioral orientations reflect institutional logics at an individual level. Purchasers' boundary-spanner behavior thus manifests itself as individual purchasers' rhetorical orientations. In a sample of 349 purchasers, we find support for the existence of four configurations of orientations: competitive/authoritarian, relational, comprehensive, and neutral. A subsequent follow-up study of 20 interviews with the most typical representatives of each group suggests storylines that reflect the background and logic of different persuasive styles. The findings highlight purchaser persuasive orientation as one facet of a purchaser capability set making it possible to cope with the transactional versus relational paradox in buyer–seller relationship contexts.}

abstract = {This paper builds upon literature addressing boundary spanners and switching suppliers in order to explore an under-examined aspect of buyer–supplier relationships: how different individuals at multiple organisational levels affect processes by which firms return, or “switch back”, to former suppliers after breaches in their relationships. Our study followed a qualitative approach by applying an abductive research methodology to make sense of 85 semi-structured interviews with executives involved in the erstwhile buyer–supplier relationships that we investigated. We found that supplier switching-back processes (SSBPs) can be understood as constituted by a set of alignments and misalignments between boundary spanners (i.e. top management, purchasing and sales agents, engineers and technicians) in the organisations involved. Thus, peoples' interactions, or lack thereof, directly affect the possibility for buyers and suppliers to restore their severed relationships. We conclude that boundary spanners pursue seven distinct roles during different periods in SSBPs, roles that relate to three identified functions of boundary spanners in such processes. The paper closes by highlighting what our findings imply for business managers, limitations and some possible directions for future research.}

abstract = {Research continues to look for advances and flaws in the theory and practice of public relations. One such flaw, coined “the paradox of the positive” (Heath & Waymer, 2009), challenges theory and practice to avoid making glowingly positive statements for and about self-interested organizations, including their products, services, and programs. The critical concern is that discourse distorts the framing of issues, and assessments of organizations themselves, by expressing bias that is overly positive (or negative). Critical public relations research presumes that discourse is most fully functional when it supports objective, enlightened decision-making. This conceptual essay explores how theory and research support discussion of the dysfunctional power of the paradox of the positive to distort valuable cultural topoi that otherwise can guide management decision making and rhetorical discourse to solve problems and make sound decisions in the public interest. By understanding the paradox and grappling with its distortive impact, scholars and practitioners can navigate the dangers, benefits, ironies, and responsibilities required to expose and wrestle with a pervasive, taken-for-granted strategic practice of professional enterprise. Moreover, the paradox of the positive can harm the interests of marginalized publics and stakeholders. As a matter of discourse strategy, the challenge is to address issues and images with as little positive (or negative) distortion as possible if the practice is to broker the public interest.}

To answer this question, the present study focuses on two primary types of corporate associations, corporate ability (CA) associations and corporate social responsibility (CSR) associations, and proposes two different types of response strategies that are association-based: CA strategy and CSR strategy. Drawing on the framework of CA-CSR, Expectancy Violation Theory, and information processing literature, this study examines whether and how these crisis response strategies interact with consumers’ pre-crisis associations and collectively influence consumer reactions in times of CSR crises. Results of two experiments render support for the predicted interaction effect. Furthermore, the results show that crisis response diagnosticity and novelty, as perceived by consumers with varied pre-crisis associations, serve as the underlying process explanations that drive the observed interaction effect. Theoretical contributions and practical implications of these results to crisis communication are also discussed.}

The aim of the study is to analyse, using natural language processing techniques, whether the terrorist attack of August 2017 and the Catalan sovereignty process, which took place during the last quarter of 2017 in Barcelona, harmed the online destination image perceived and transmitted by tourists, through language recognition, frequency analysis and term categorisation of more than 150,000 online travel reviews, written in English, Spanish, French, German or Italian, posted on a shared-lodging platform. The findings show that visitors did not fear for their personal safety despite the seriousness and immense international media coverage of both events. The opinion of tourists, shared through online reviews, can help companies to improve the supply of goods and services.}
